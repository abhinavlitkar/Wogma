0,"[When Avengers: Age of Ultron was announced, the biggest question fans would have had is, 'How does one top The Avengers? How does one even match something as insanely fun as that, never mind surpassing it?' The immediate pressure on writer-director Joss Whedon, of course, would be - how does he begin this next film, after that gargantuan extended climactic battle set in New York. Hardly any film has landed in theatres with the kind of expectations loaded onto it, as Age of Ultron has. Whedon, though, doesn't merely beat the expectations - he subverts them, does his own thing, and  trumps it by creating a film that goes past the first film in just how grand and stunning it is. He does this from the get go, with a jaw-dropping opening sequence featuring all the Avengers appearing one after the other in a single take ultra-action shot, choreographed to gobsmacking perfection. From there, the ride only gets crazier.The elements that made the first film fun are all there - the all-star lineup; beautifully etched characters that bounce off each other through rib-ticklingly written snark masquerading as dialogue; the push-pull magnetism of these characters stretching in every direction to create a harmony between what they do and what they say; and of course, outrageous action set pieces that keep you hooked every second. Whedon quite simply pulls off a bigger, more complex film that doesn't only broaden its scale, but which also travels deeper into the characters and opens them up from the inside.You see, this time they have a different adversary to contend with, when a brainchild of tech genius Tony Stark (or Iron Man, of course) that was meant to save the world becomes sentient, intelligent, and decides that the world is safest without the Avengers in it. Ultron comes to life, and the Avengers have to deal with an enemy born on the inside. To make matters harder, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch enter the fray, as they bring with them powers that seem the Avengers are no match for.The plot of the film is rather basic - a bad guy ascends and becomes increasingly powerful, until there is a big climactic faceoff between him and the ones who want to save the world from him. In that sense, those expecting to be blown away by 'story', may end up disappointed. Whedon's genius really lies in how he manages to make such a hugely mounted film an intimate experience as well. The emotions the film plays with, the deep dark fears that pervade even the best of hearts, the element of sacrifice, of choosing to be a hero because you have the ability that others don't, and so you also have the responsibilities that others don't - these are all primal and elemental. Observing how he weaves these with this set of characters is a true joy to watch.So the Hulk and Natasha Romanoff have an interesting dynamic going on between them, even as Iron Man and Captain America haven't ceased taking jibes at each other. Things get even more interesting as the Avengers deal with the twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, particularly as the latter has the ability to play tricks on their minds. It may not look it, but Age of Ultron is a dark film. Dolled up in the Marvel glitz, it never seems to slip into DC's brooding Nolan-esque interpretations of a superhero (which first enthralled audiences, and now seems to draw their ire). No, Age of Ultron is very much a Marvel film, with all their staple ingredients, and it fits nicely into what has been seen so far in the Marvel cinematic universe, and what is coming up from them. In the Marvel cinematic universe, the ultimate battle of the Avengers will be with Thanos, who had appeared briefly in the mid-credits scene of the first film. So Age of Ultron is only a pitstop in the larger scheme of things. But Whedon ensures that Age of Ultron is a finite film in itself as well, because even as it sets things up for the next few films, it also has its own ending. When Age of Ultron ends, it feels like something has ended; that things will never be the same after this.This will be Joss Whedon's last film at Marvel for the time being, so he makes sure that it ends on his terms.His framing and cutting are downright impressive. Sample this: Quicksilver, who can run at blinding speeds, is just about to engage in battle. As he preps himself, he reaches for... sports shoes. In a shot that doesn't even last one full second, we see a stack of shoes of a popular global sportswear brand, before he one of picks them up. Aah, product placement, Josh Whedon style. Even the manner in which Whedon looks inside the minds of the Avengers - with expressionist montages cut with mind-boggling panache, is a big departure from stock Marvel films. Rarely has a film managed to keep the sustained pace and energy that Age of Ultron has. Even when it slows down to bring us closer to the characters, you're still continuously bombarded with information (and, of course, delicious humour). In that sense, the film almost has a monotonous graph. It can get a bit too much to handle at times, but that's only because Joss Whedon has under 150 minutes to leave his final imprint on the Marvel films. And boy, does he deliver in style.Age of Ultron is intense, spectacular and supremely fun. I've never subscribed to the theory that films are merely entertainment, but if films have to be entertainment, then Whedon shows the world that this is how it's done.]"
1,"[A non-believer is made to try on religion for size due to social and emotional pressures. Off late we've seen a couple of films that go on to rebuke blind faith and they've done a decent job too. In fact, both PK and OMG have been referenced to in Dharam Sankat Mein. I was bracing up for yet another film along the same lines. While Dharam Sankat Mein is different in the way in which the religious dilemma presents itself, it turns out long-winded, rather instructional and most importantly underwhelming. I am all for subtlety and am not looking for melodrama, but with a premise as this, Dharam Sankat Mein ought to have had a crescendo which is lacking. Our protagonist, Dharam (pun intended and works at multiple levels) is not so much of an atheist as he is a person who doesn't identify with blind faith. He doesn't care too much for the religion he belongs to. Yet, the writer subtly slides in the nature of our society by having him make nasty remarks about another religion. True to his nature, Dharam does become neutral as the situation demands. And I loved how his precarious  situation plays out, where agnostic Dharam ends up having to understand more than one religions.Beyond this basic smartness in the writing though, the film falls limp very soon. The stage is set early on and you are waiting for something to happen, which doesn't. The two opposing directions that Dharam gets pulled into are not convincing enough for a man who is pretty comfortable with who he is. Somehow you can't visualise a person like Dharam submitting to anything meekly. The item numbers and shabby climax don't help either. Also, the film becomes preachy all too often. This indirectly breaks the fourth wall and jolts  you from a common middle class man's uncommon story into the film you are watching. This is despite yet another perfect common man portrayal by Paresh Rawal. Yet another film that he carries broadly on his shoulder. Even so, I appreciate the fact that despite the preachy nature of the film, a different approach was endeavoured. More power to such trials even if not many of us are taken in by them. ]"
2,"[All that glitters is not gold. All that sounds ambitious is not awe-inspiring. All that seems unconventional is not path-breaking. And all is not Chaitanya Tamhane's Court. Brimming with non-conformist aesthetics and peculiar treatment, the film exudes a sublime illustration of cinematic flamboyance. The painstakingly-penned script brilliantly musters varied narrative elements to craft a terrific piece of art. Realistic to the core, Tamhane's visual storytelling transcend linguistic barriers with a dramatic ease. Perhaps not everyone's cup of tea, it's a welcome change nonetheless. While being an eye-opener for our flawed society, it could also be a trend-setter for audiences.A folk singer fearlessly indulges in radical activism against political wrongdoings. A defence lawyer, living a prosperous life, selflessly rallies behind those arrested unlawfully. A public prosecutor dutifully pursues the job to her without worrying about the legitimacy of a case. A judge obliviously relies on obsolete laws rather than the spirit of the law. A widow hopes to earn her living rather than accept charity. This is the world of Court, where the anguish of its characters easily shatters one's thoughts of an ideal world. The case of this activist poet, allegedly charged for abetting the widow's husband to commit suicide, is what binds this world together.Court outdoes routine courtroom dramas to the last bits because of its radical storytelling. Instead of taking sides or being an interpreter, it chooses to be a distant observer. The simplicity with which Tamhane builds his characters and their backstories without uttering a single direct word is quite an achievement. Letting their agonies do all the talking, he paints a stark picture of the widening inequality and the worrying state of freedom of speech. He refuses to be preachy even while laying out the tiniest details - be it the Dalit killings, political propaganda or the plight of blue-collar workers.Since our judgment hinges on cultural and social milieu, Tamhane takes you away from the courtroom to their personal lives. Appearing inconsequential on the face, the lifestyles offer great insight and prove to be a master stroke element in  the plot. A pragmatic approach in unfolding the story stays true to the subject and pays off, despite virtually non-existent drama. The film uses courtroom as a means to lay bare the flaws of Indian society at large rather than ridiculing judicial system alone.With authentic production design, prolonged shots and no background score; Tamhane not only presents you the dull judicial proceedings, but also makes you feel the drabness. Each camera angle and its movement is well designed and keeps you involved as an observer. A striking balance between visual treatment and colour palette harmonizes the realism, making the film powerful. The repetitive use of bluish hues, even in warmer tones, creates an air of sombreness and monotony - which is perfectly in consonance with its theme. The lighting conditions dip from bright to dark as the trial unfolds, depicting its gloominess. When was the last time an Indian film excelled so well in visual storytelling? Bravo!Vira Sathidar portrays Narayan Kamble impeccably.It's hard to believe he is a non-actor, as are all other characters. Sambhaji Bhagat's invigorating vocals bring a huge difference to his act. I am not sure if radical songs can instigate someone to commit suicide. But they certainly have enough vigour to make you adore them, just as they add to the film's advantage.Court effortlessly manifests that hardcore realism can serve as an engaging experience. No wonder it is indisputably the best debut of the times and Tamhane gets everything right, something that is sure to leave many of his contemporaries as well as seasoned filmmakers in awe. Films like this make me believe that the resurgence of Marathi cinema is truly a thing of reality. If anything, resurgence at its staggering best.]"
3,"[The Green Hornet was a radio show back in 1930s, which later translated into a comic book series, a television series and now a movie. When a concept has been working well for the audiences in so many variants for decades, you'd think its real hard to screw that up now with all the technology at your disposal. This film almost manages to amaze you by doing just that. 'Almost' being the key-word here, as its still a good fun-filled mindless action movie, but nowhere near as awesome as the other forms of the franchise. After The Incredibles, there have been plenty of flicks that have experimented with the superhero concept. Some have been successful (Kick-Ass, Megamind, etc) while others have miserably failed (Epic Movie, Underdog, etc). The Green Hornet lies somewhere in between because it has Seth Rogen as Brett Reid, a.k.a The Green Hornet, as the egocentric cocky billionaire with daddy issues and a hero complex (sounds familiar?) who fits into your pop-culture superhero perfectly; and on the other hand you have Jay Chou as Kato, his faithful partner, who does all the hard-work from kicking the bad guys to building weapons, cars, coffee-machines, pretty much everything as if he was born to be a superhero. An idiot with a big mouth and a kung-fu god, has been a trusted formula for success but it falls a little short for this film. A very mundane screenplay and under-utilization of the actors is to blame.Seth Rogen is the lead actor, writer and producer for the film. And with great power, comes greater screen-time. He is all over the movie. I like Seth Rogen, I do, but when you have an immensely talented actor like Christoph Waltz and a looker like Cameron Diaz on your team, you ought to give them time to shine too. Cameron is totally wasted in the film with very little screen time for her to do anything meaningful. She makes most of what she's got though. Christoph Waltz is the reason, I insist you watch the film rather than just let it go. The guy is a powerhouse of talent. He's done an excellent job at being the self-conscious psychopathic crime boss. For me, the most memorable scene of the movie is between him and James Franco in his cameo (another very talented guy). If only James had a longer role, this movie would have done wonders. Jay Chou had Bruce Lee's shoes to fill in, who played Kato in the television series. Needless to say they are pretty-darn big and near impossible shoes to fill in. He does a respectable job though, and is awesome in action sequences. But I'm so not a fan of the red-eye thing they've inserted in every action sequence. Sometimes technology works against you. Michel Gondry (director) could have done a much better job. Music score of the film is great. Soundtrack had many songs I grew up listening to.Its a good action flick with enough comic moments to satisfy you. But has nothing much to remember it by. Watch on DVD for sure.]"
4,"[A Bhatt film starring Emraan Hashmi can pique your interest only so much. After what we can call a typical start to a Bhatt-thriller, comes the typical death and inevitable resurrection/revival. The mumbo-jumbo is different, but outcome typical. What is atypical though is the resolution. It makes you sit up and notice, if you have been paying attention thus far, that is. It doesn't help that the actors all seem to be going through the motions rather than emotions. It must be said though that the lead lady's character gets a bit more to do here than your typical film in this genre. The story winds and unwinds way too much in the second half. It is almost as if the intriguing climax was the goal. The events leading up to it had to be convincing given the maze of characters and their motivations. So, whatever it took to get to that end given the constraints was done. On the way you have some decent use of CGI, though I'd have liked to see it in 2D. The prosthetics are pretty awful, the kind that makes you laugh rather than gross you out. At the end, I was a little surprised and a little disappointed. Given the dilemma and the conclusion thereof, the concept deserved better screenplay and writing. Should I be happy then that there seems to be a series on the way? ;)]"
5,"[Young adulthood, experimenting with one's sexuality, being comfortable with one's selfishness because that is good for you, relentlessness of life, society's attitude towards homosexuality, dealing with death, and of course society's juggle between harmful over-sensitivity and insensitivity towards differently-abled people - these are some of the themes that Margarita With A Straw touches upon. Each of these make for a film by itself. Usually, a movie that tries to achieve all of this falls flat because it ends up being all over the place. Margarita With A Straw manages to tie it in all together, even if just barely. That in itself is an achievement, other than the fact that it even dares to touch upon so many topics that remain largely untouched by Hindi films. Here's a confused yet composed character who is at most times sure of what she wants and finds one way or the other to get it - even if it is a way of resolving her confusion. She could teach us a lesson or two in accepting and loving ourselves with our flaws. Oh and she happens to suffer from cerebral palsy. She is an inspiration not only because of her disability, but because she is as normal as it gets. She is mean when she has to be, manipulative as necessary and generally a warm and cool person - Laila (Kalki Koechlin). I am grateful to the writers, makers and actors for not making Laila an ideal, sacchrine person who we are compelled to like - as in you will be judged if you don't like her. Instead she is a person as grey as you and I. On the other hand, I always struggle with films that I find myself being thankful to for things they did not do. Isn't creating a multi-layered protagonist what a writer supposed to do? Setting that aside, that I sensed all these layers without it necessarily being spelt out for me says it all as far as Kalki Koechlin's performance goes. Within a few minutes you start seeing Laila as a person beyond her disability. Can there be a better compliment for an actor who is playing a character with a disability, a developmental disability at that? Each of the other characters are played by equally strong actors. Though they aren't written as strongly. For example, Revathi who plays Laila's mom plays it too cool for an Indian parent. If she is indeed a cool mom, that doesn't show through her character, but is something you have to accept because you are told so. In comparison, her father seems to be a more liberal parent of the two. Similarly, Laila's lady friend, Khanoum (Sayani Gupta) gets a rather flat treatment after the initial intrigue she creates. And yet, these seem mere niggles in the broader space the film tries to encompass. It is indeed a challenge to get through talking about such topics, each one more important than the next, without being preachy. This one too slips into a ""lesson"" mode for a moment or so reminding you that it is a film. Even so, the film seems like it needed to be made. And it needs to be watched.Margarita With A Straw is a statement on behalf the world's largest minority as Maysoon Zayid who suffers from Cerebral Palsy and calls it one of her 99 problems points out in her TED talk. They want to be disassociated from their disability. They want to create an identity that is separate from their disability. Like Maysoon, palsy is just one of the problems Laila has. Similarly, Margarita With A Straw is simply amazing at the number of things it tries to achieve. Then again, just like it is wrong, at many levels, to reward a person because of their disability, would it be right to award points to a film because it is about a disabled person or the n other topics it touches upon? The related conundrum is do you take away points just because you don't want to be going wrong at many levels? That the question arises itself is testimony enough that Margarita With A Straw leaves a bit amiss.I can complain about not being touched deep within or I can feel happy that it didn't try to manipulate my emotions while having such a bait at its disposal and more. But, one thing it certainly is not is underwhelming. Now or later, in theaters or when its out elsewhere - do watch it! And legally, please. ]"
6,"[A strong idea and great story certainly play a big part in a fine film. But these alone cannot ascertain the quality of one. A good motion picture (or anything good for that matter) is rarely a coincidence. It's rather the fruition of gripping vision and decisive execution, besides loads of other factors in varying degrees. Of course, there can be exceptions. Sometimes a story fascinates you so much so that its weaknesses hardly make a difference. Such an exception cannot be made for Kranti Redkar's debut feature Kaakan however.Split over two different periods unfolds the heart-warming tale of romance, faith and companionship. But surprisingly, this isn't Kisu and Sudhamati's story alone in the first place. It is as much the story of other principal or trivial characters. Each one of them has their own story to tell and each story could be a standalone movie. Every now and then Redkar brings forth  some sort of background story to these characters. This is done to bring in a poignant touch and make you empathize with them - nothing of the sort ensues though.Since each character emerges hero and their stories heroic, subplots tend to distract your interest from the main drama at times. The problem here is that the whole thing is spoon-fed through redundant dialogue. The director prefers informative tricks over visual impact, taking the easy way out. With little narrative novelty, the screenplay lacks subtlety and insights. Logical connections to certain events as well as sequences overlook deliberate thinking.Kaakan is a beguiling idea, but sadly that remains only at a basic level. It is riddled with endless loopholes and mediocrity. But the problem doesn't end here. Rather it starts off from there, ultimately floundering in what it sets out to do.Jitendra Joshi's bogeyman image among kids sounds funny, but poor characterisation ensures that you feel nothing about his worsened conditions. Even so, young Kisu is far more stirring and impressive than the older one. The outcome of flawed direction, he suffers from inconsistent portrayal, as does Urmila Kanitkar's Sudhamati or Ashutosh Gaikwad's Gopi. Though not directional masterpiece, the scenes involving Joshi and Kanitkar are compelling than the whole film itself. Rest of it highlights Redkar's negligent approach. Over the period; the characters age, but their props don't - be it Sudhamati's ribbon or kaakan or even the inside of the tin. By the looks of it, Kisu seems to have had his special haircut and makeup done. Sloppiness in hair &amp; makeup is as much a concern as is its writing and visualization.The music though stands really strong when everything else fails. It intensifies the film to a point, until its overuse fades the dominance away in the longer run. Foley sound effects and  faulty dubbing add to growing failings, making it technically weak. Not that it's an offence to make another love story along standard lines. But one should at least be mindful of where and when to draw the line. Not only does Kranti Redkar fail miserably in the writing department, but she also comes across as totally clueless wearing the director's hat.]"
7,"[The movie opens with a man standing in the middle of a lush green farm. And when you realize he is going to commit suicide, the contrast between the rich field and the poor man hits you like a bolt. No people, this is not a spoiler, it's a true life story. It's the story of over 150000 farmers who've killed themselves. We've already read about it in the newspapers. But now that we have a visual it will stay with us for a while.Another contrast strikes when this scene cuts to three men behaving like boys. Arrogant and ""kewl"", Carefree and irresponsible, wannabe and dependent (Sikandar, Arjan Bajwa, and Alekh Sangal). Yes, the characters of the three friends are defined in these 5 minutes. Similarly, the two lead women, one an epitome of all things motherly, the other almost the exact opposite are etched out for us in the next 10 minutes (Gul Panag and Uvika Choudhary). Later, when we are introduced to the village doctor (Ashutosh Rana) too, we can sense how despite his helplessness, he's trying to help in the best possible manner. Most of the credit for these clear definitions goes to the writing. The casual and aptly light lines in the beginning are of course done justice to by their delivery. But, somehow, there is a heavy tinge of artificiality in the performances except for those by Gul and Ashutosh. Gul is the cute momly figure we love to annoy and has a breathtakingly well-performed scene in the last half hour. Ashutosh Rana's performance shows a new facet of his talent. It is refreshing to see him in a non-villainous, soft role. Again kudos to some well-written scenes. The transformation of these city based, hip, largely insensitive youngsters into working towards to a cause happens gradually and not ungrudgingly. However, all's not well as far as writing is concerned too. Uvika's and Alekh's roles are underwritten and lack depth after the initial exposition. Their motivations are not clear and because of that, I got the feel that maybe the movie could've done without them. Also the movie could have saved precious 20 odd minutes by keeping the absolutely dispensable songs out - both in terms of the music itself, and the way they are picturised. I could also make observations about things like Sikandar's cringed nose and squinted eyes. But, I would then lose focus on what the movie is trying to aim at. One would be absolutely right to say that none of the departments of film-making seem to have been delved into 100% - be it writing, acting, or other technical aspects like camerawork or editing. But, full marks at attempting to describe the complex issues involved in the farmer suicides. Yes, there are a whole load of sub-plots, but each one shows a different link in the chain of events that leads to the ultimate breakdown of the farmer who grows us our daily rice and dal (lentil curry). At many points in the movie, I was wondering why is this movie being targeted towards the multiplex audience when the issues they are trying to resolve are situated in a land far, far away. And that is THE point. It is aimed towards me and you, browsing the net looking for reviews of the latest release. It is to sensitize us to what's happening out there or rather in there, in the interiors of the country. It doesn't offer any earth-shattering, practical solutions. In fact it alludes to the fact that we are intelligent people out here. Why don't we do something? What? How? When? That's for us to figure out. They have given us the why. Maybe one of the solutions is to have us do rural training as a part of our education - why only medical students? Engineers, managers, accountants, artists can contribute too. Is it that farfetched? It's not that impossible to reach out to our sensitivity, is it? Of course, the going is hardly going to be easy. The most righteous of us will be wronged, but the most unsympathetic can also be made human.I am thrilled. Thrilled that new things are being tried in Hindi cinema. Be it, the narrative style in Aamir or the most abstract use of metaphor in No Smoking or a theme that moviemakers wouldn't dare touch with a yardstick like in Summer 2007. All of them have commercial doom written all over them. And not just because of the way they are made, but I'm sure even on paper, the people involved knew very well that it's not going to make moolah. But, it is their urge to tell their story that brings these stories to us. Of course, I would be even more thrilled if Aamir and Summer 2007 did well at the box office. But I'm glad that the unlikelihood of financial success didn't keep the movies from being made. And at the very least Summer 2007 serves as documentation of how things were in India in the '00s and how we reacted to them.]"
8,"[You wait for the plot to thicken or a twist that will be different from what you expect. But, it doesn't quite happen. So, you end up admiring the attempt at creating the era of the 40s. I also found myself marveling at the fact that the project didn't get YRiF-ied. But, the thriller by itself is hardly edge-of-seat material.So, maybe, not all thrillers need to keep you tense through the run-time. But, you need something to look forward to, especially when you have guessed whodunnit in the character's first appearance on screen. I was hoping to clap with glee to find out I was wrong and at the same time could hear myself say, ""No chance!"" Unfortunately, the latter part of me won. Fortunately, while I waited then for the inevitable reveal, there was quite a bit I could distract myself with. Maybe it is just our need for something different, but the old-world indeed has its own charm. The rusty, rugged ""reality"". Sure, a lot of attention to detail. But every once in a while, you are jolted out of the era, whether it be a bold sexual attempt by a lady or music that is a tad too modern. The performances though keep you steadfast, willing you to see the film through to the end. Neeraj Kabi holds your interest from the beginning. And so does Swastika Mukherjee, even if it is forceful titillatio, she's there to do a job and she does it well. Sushant Singh Rajput, of course, fits the bill perfectly. As he gets excited by the mystery, disappointed when he doesn't ""get it"", grossed out at different points in the film, you know his character, Byomkesh Bakshy just a bit more. This is as important as the mystery itself - knowing the investigator, your protagonist. Especially, if the writers are aspiring to turn this into a series, which they clearly are. Byomkesh Bakshy, the character does create enough interest for you to want to watch his next adventure, even if the first one by itself wasn't enticing. Dibaker Banerjee scored alright then, didn't he? You want to watch the next one, even though the first one leaves you underwhelmed. ]"
9,"[This is probably one of the most-hyped Marathi films of the year after Ravi Jadhav's Timepass 2 and understandably so. After all, not every other film gets presented by such a bankable name. That's the lone reason I kept my fingers crossed hoping to find something engaging in a seemingly done-to-death, over-dramatized. This also perhaps motivates you to watch the film - in case you feel let down by its  trailer. Not to my surprise, he is not the only instrumental force here. A slightly fresh perspective - though not utterly mature - strings together glimpses of writing brilliance with glistering visual aesthetics, adjudging director Prakash Kunte's rom-com a force to reckon with.Both Rege (another Ravi Jadhav presentation) and Coffee Ani Barach Kahi looked abysmal prior to their releases, all thanks to bewildering marketing. Trailers of these two take great amount of pains to appear outright conventional (presumably to hold in your expectations), yet the films themselves merit as distinctive and highly enjoyable. The misleading promotions are predictable and have sugarcoated narrative layers.Jaai, the film's female lead character is perplexing. A software engineer by profession, she comes out as an out-and-out confident, independent, modern woman. A weird-sounding, old song set as her phone's ringtone or Puneri one-liners written on her bedroom wall or even her choice of clothes deem her a free-spirited, ferocious personality. And she does appear rattlingly fierce during her encounter with a prospective groom, a childhood friend.Her parents sound exceedingly supportive, if gags about the endless affairs of Jaai's younger sister are anything to go by. Strangely enough, she looks baffled and timid when they question her relationship status. Her bluntness, at other times, certainly raises conflicting images. The world around her is so mature that her complications emerge as infantile, something this prospective groom points out eventually. The issues of inconsistent portrayal don't haunt just her character however; the film is full of them.Similar to other girl-meets-boy stories, this film is not devoid of a customary world - where Jaai and Nishad are surrounded by characters that pass on philosophical thoughts in order to help them be soulmates.  But you see, that's not the point here - predictability is sure going to drive the plot somewhere or the other.Coffee Ani Barach Kahi has the timely infusion of philosophy saddled with remarkably playful dialogues. I don't remember the last time a Marathi film had conversations so bubbly, yet so persuasive. At times, these thoughtfully-written words guide the narrative in an astoundingly nuanced, unpretentious style. Not to mention soulful poetries put the message across without being overbearingly sentimental or hindering the film's narrative flow.This is a rom-com, which clearly shows the way without a dance sequence along beachsides. That said, it doesn't shy away from cliches. This is where such an effortless work becomes laborious and ineffective.Sure, this film is no stunner. It freezes as an unfulfilling one, despite its platter of intriguing elements as indicated by its title. Nonetheless, it is so beautiful and honest in its endeavor that the whole, so-called conservative approach appears trivial.]"
10,"[Hunterrr's sex comedy bit is just the garnishing. To make the dish look palatable and draw you into the theater. No wonder you don't see much more than what you've already seen in the trailers. So, those of us going in to see our sexual needs represented in a comic way will be disappointed because that bit you've already seen in the promos. Those of us going in for the story of a boy who grew up like us or the romance will see nothing new because you've seen it in some other film.And I have an inkling the writers were very aware of this. Only that can explain the back and forth in timelines. Usually, non-linearity is very intriguing and works brilliantly in building up to the climax. But, in Hunterrr after a point, I stopped caring. It didn't matter when Mandar dated which woman. Woman after woman till present day. He shows no disrespect to any woman but has his priorities right - and understandably so. It is ok for the emotional hook and identification with characters to be missing. But, here it is complete disinterest in how his life turns out or what events lead up to that. Also, the scenes where the audience is being twirled between imagination and reality get a little tedious. Except for some witty dialogue (most of which again you have seen in the trailer), the writing misses target.Protagonist Mandar (Gulshan Devaiah) is a guy on the street who is always looking out for women. Not to be confused with ""watching out for women"" - just in case the word 'protagonist' in the context of a Hindi film, threw you off. He's the guy who looks at women in a way that'd make women uncomfortable. But for some reason, none of the women he looks at in the film experience discomfort with his attention. I guess the player that he is, he knows his way around. If it were not for the performances, the novelty of Hunterrr would have died down very quickly turning it into a very sleazy affair. Gulshan Devaiah gives the creeps and goes shy in sync with the need of the scene. As a natural progression, there is a certain amount of tackiness in the way he approaches the women. But hey, if the women don't mind his overtures, you respect their choice and accept the events. Which in turn means that all the women are convincing. Radhika Apte has a certain ease with which she performs. You end up believing her reactions in the weirdest of situations (across films). Other than that, there are some social references in the film which are rather overt - from safe sex to child sex abuse or paternal abuse of girl child to our preference for the fair when it comes to the fairer gender and so on. These seem out of place because the film is otherwise very comfortable in its space of sex comedy. These other things kind of jump out as awkward in trying to prove that the film is more than what it is - a justification for sexual gestures and norms from groping to men befriending women with only one intention; it is all a part of growing up, you see. Fortunately for the film and unfortunately for real life, this explanation is how it is. Only some boys become men sooner rather than later. Sure, we do need films that talk about sexuality - both male and female. There is a lot of talk about representing the sexual needs of women in films. But, the sexual needs of men too aren't addressed other than in the context of rape. Hunterrr is fresh in that context. Beyond that though, it is a regular coming-of-age plus love story. Not very interesting once you get past the ""different"" part of the background.]"
11,"[You drive through a city, a city that looks like any other. A couple is driving to a party, engaging in the regular couple banter. You know danger is looming. You know because you have seen the trailer. Like the beginning of a typical Hindi horror film, the couple walks into the mouth of the lion that is going to gnaw it down. But, unlike the horror film, NH10 grips you by the collar and clenches at it through the two hours. When was the last time you could say that about a film? Even if you are uncomfortable through the length of the film.And this is when you are prepared for the film. The trailer has ample warning, in fact over-preps you for the film's intensity. You go in expecting the worst things happening to the lead lady and even though they don't manifest, the discomfort is relentless. From the word go, the writing hits upon taboo, gender divide, status of women in our society. Even before you get to the crux of the film, a scare is brought in. Much like newspaper headlines with shocking news day after day, tirelessly, the film hits you with one scary face of society and human being after another. So much so that you wonder if we are that any more - social or human. Arjun (Neil Bhoopalam) and Mira (Anushka Sharma) are like two sides of you - scared and yet moved from the inside, enough to want to do something about the injustice that makes the world. There is no overt social message, but you are unsettled. Arjun and Mira, an urban couple, want to protect another couple which is being beaten up by their own family for dishonoring the family and caste. But, NH10 is not only about honor killing or safety of women and so on. It is more a pointer at what human beings are capable of - when she is blinded by her beliefs or he wants to prove he's macho or they are blinded by a need for revenge. In any of these cases, they don't want or trust the system, they want control over their own matters. Through this myriad of thoughts, the tension - through background music (or lack thereof), the camera work - stays just right. The chases, the situations are such that when you get respite from the build-up, you are ready for it. Despite your admiration for how real the situation is and constantly thinking about what you'd do if you were in their place, you welcome that relief in the form of a background song or an emotional scene or a cinematic liberty. Even though you know those wouldn't come to your rescue in real life. Unfortunately, these same things takes away from the film. They remind you, you are only watching a film, after all. As much as you want to believe the ridiculous coincidences, they disconnect you from the characters and the situations who you were so close to, just a second ago. Even so, it is a thriller indeed. A thriller so well-made that as I reach towards the end of what I want to say about the film, I haven't yet spoken about the most striking thing about the film - the performances. While you could call Neil Bhoopalam the hero(?) of the film, and he does his bit convincingly, your hatred toward Darshan Kumaar's Satbir takes up your emotional energy. And of course your worry for Mira. Anushka Sharma has given it her all. You are watching Mira, a person you might see at a candle-light vigil, the woman who wants to make a place in this world of men (a world where an all men-committee decides how to sell a female hygiene product), a person who cares about a security guard doing his duty - a person like you and me. And even while, neither you nor I would like to be in the situation Mira finds herself in, we would all like to be like her when push comes to shove. Especially, in the climax. But, for a film which attempts to keep things real, the climax is outlandish. The drama, a little over-stated. I guess, like the characters of the film, from the film-makers point of view too, it is a ""you gotta do what you gotta do.""What stays though is that despite the intentional laxity in the writing, your muscles stay taut. The mind stays worked up and alert thinking of what you would do in real life, despite the unreal coincidences. Most of all, the intensity doesn't leave you long after you've left the theater. How many thrillers can you say that about? ]"
12,"[Almost everyone who is reading this review is in or has had a romantic relationship like you see in Bewakoofiyaan. And it would be a rare couple, if at all, who hasn't had a fight. Would our story make for a good film though? Most likely, not. Not because we make for boring people but because it's everyday life. So, does everyday life not make for good films? It does, but it needs very special skills and an out-of-the-box way to go about the story to make for an engaging story. Bewakoofiyaan is not that story.Bewakoofiyaan has an energetic, aspirational, young couple in Mohit (Ayushman Khurana) and Mayera (Sonam Kapoor). You relate to them because they are more or less like you. You start rooting for them from the very beginning. Ayushman Khurana's comic timing and chemistry with father-in-law-to-be (Rishi Kapoor) keeps matters light and engaging for a bit. But, soon enough things start getting repetitive and before you know it, you have started predicting the next sequence pretty accurately. Ayushman Khurana does go through the whole ""down"" time pretty convincingly. Sonam Kapoor too goes does the middle class lady who takes her success in stride while being a supporting girlfriend and a caring daughter with ease. But decent performances by the three main characters cannot life the film from the general bore that it is. Sure, Bewakoofiyaan does try to be different in how the adamant father's reluctance to warm up to the daughter's boyfriend. The lead pair's characters are also pretty close to earth in an urban way.Mohit  adequately goes through the phases of over-confidence, confidence, insecure and then bruised ego as any young man who has lost his job would. Mayera is always there for Mohit, aspirational yet in control of those aspirations. It can be argued that she sacrifices her career goals and isn't the woman of today's day and age she is made out to be. But, I'd give the writers that. I'd say Mayera knows what are priorities are and doesn't care how we judge her for them. It is a shame then, that despite characters written with more thought than you would see in your average Hindi rom-com, Bewakoofiyan ultimately falls below par. A huge part of the blame can be taken by the film's pace. The love between the couple, the father's sweet reluctance takes its time to build up. The fallout between the couple while the father-son-in-law relationship takes its own turn is cumbersome yet not intolerable. The problem is with the climax which is both rushed and over-simplistic in its writing and execution. Especially, when compared to the rest of the film. The same old cliches kick in with double force which makes you feel, you sat through all of that for this? With very little going for it in the music and other technical departments then, Bewakoofiyaan feels like listening to a friend's woes about their relationship - with empathy and love; but you want them to kiss and patch up, already. So, that you can move on too. ]"
13,"[Does the motivation of a murder justify the murder? Does time elapsed justify forgiving a crime? Is revenge futile? Does it become justified because of the first wrong done? Is a cold-blooded crime less justifiable than one committed in the heat of the moment? Does your justification depend on the justification of the criminal? Is forgiveness less palatable when done by a criminal? You might have your answers to all these questions, but the ambiguity will remain. They are, after all, only ""yours"". Your ""justifiable"" will different from mine. The point is, Badlapur makes you think about where you've drawn the line. Even if not entirely convincing. In that sense, Badlapur pushes the boundaries of a regular Hindi thriller film. We all know its going to go one way or the other - the wronged is going to either take revenge or not.  Badlapur makes you reconsider what and how much your conscience will  allow even if you are not in the judge's seat. But, it involves a leap of faith from your side.We make allowances for films that we begin to like while watching them or the ones we want to like. But very often, the story jerks in a way that you don't quite get. Badlapur did that to me with its character transformations. Sure, they are unpredictable and the unexpected is seldom unexciting. But unpredictable change towards something that was built up for over an hour of screen time doesn't convince you. For me that and the one passage of time  were deal-breakers.  Especially, a short scene just explains it off asking characters and audience to introspect. As a film, a story, Badlapur makes you think of it as a convenient contrivance. As a concept though the film stays with you and it is not only because of the intensity of the violence. If you take what happens as a given you will find yourself mulling over it in circular thoughts. And that is Badlapur's success. You are with the film after the 2+ hours in the theater. The actors stay with you for long after. Nawazuddin Siddiqui makes you laugh in the darkest moments to go with the noir tone of the film. The character and the actor compliment each other perfectly, as can be said about every character that the man plays. So used to his class act are we, that the one thing that I'll remember Badlapur by is Varun Dhawan's performance. It might be a cakewalk for a good actor to play a brooder/sulker. But, Varun Dhawan carries it off while drawin sympathy from the audience. You almost feel like telling him to let go of his anger for his own sake. Huma Qureshi plays aloof and concerned all at once exactly like her character would be in her place. All others in their bit roles from Vinay Pathak to Radhika Apte to Ashwini Kalsekar and Divya Dutta keep the film very rooted. Their expressions and body language make you believe what their character feels. But you might or might not be convinced of what the character feels in the first place. I am slightly ambivalent about the pace of the film too. Not that the slow build-up was an issue, but I can't help but think how the dynamics would have changed had the film lingered a little less and stayed crisp as one has come to accept of a thriller. Starting with a philosophy ""The axe forgets. The tree remembers."", Badlapur obviously aims at being a psychological thriller. Unfortunately, it neither is whole-heartedly psychological nor a thriller. Even though it makes you introspect your attitude towards crime and justice.]"
14,"[Do you fall in love and get married or get married and then learn to love? What if you learn to hate instead of learn to love? What if the whole thing starts in one's resentment towards the other for no fault of the others? What's new about it anyway? Not in India, anyway. What makes Dum Laga Ke Haisha such a warm film, then? A film which has characters that wear their weaknesses on their sleeves to make the film charmingly close to real life - save for the climax, of course. Prem aka Lappu (Ayushmann Khurrana) has been no good at academics and loves Kumar Sanu. He is pretty much considered good for nothing by all around and in return is cynical about the world around. Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar) is educated, mature and is submissive but won't take nonsense lying down either. She's a woman's woman who has no self-worth issues. She is also not the conventional definition of good-looking either. And therein lies the crux of the conflict in the film. With very little to go on, other than gut-feel an arranged marriage relies a whole lot on how the other person looks. And Prem gets pressurized into marrying someone who he doesn't like at first look. So, why does he get married at all? Well, he is considered a good for nothing, remember? And what voice does a suppressed lad have when he has achieved little in life, right?That there is a pointer at the scores of social dynamics in an arranged marriage - pressure, gut, looks, submissiveness and so on. Dum Laga Ke Haisha has captured it all so well and in just the right measure to not make it dramatic and yet keeping you completely engrossed. Sure, it falls into the historic, cop-out trap of both a quick, convenient finish and dramatizing the events. But it tries. It tries with the right ingredients that work well - conversations in a relationship. Unfortunately, there aren't enough of them to make events believable. I understand, there is always the risk of too many conversations and the danger of the run-time slipping across the two-hour zone. But, the balancing act left a little something lacking. Fortunately, it wasn't the performances. Of course, no film about ordinary domestic squabbles can manage to create warmth without ace acting by all involved. And that is exactly what Dum Laga Ke Haisha has. From the lead roles to the ones on the side you know which one is likely to behave in what sort of a way in the given situation. The bitterness, the selfishness, the momentary pleasure and the pain all come through.Yet, Dum Laga Ke Haisha is not a very serious film. Sure, it addresses a social flaw and how the people that make the same society are coping with it. At the same time it isn't too satirical or dark. It brings a smile because the characters have their quirks and keeps you interested because the characters are like you and me, only with different quirks. What else can one ask from a film that aims to do exactly that! And this once I mean that in a nice way. ]"
15,"[Period films and voiceovers presumably share unbridled equation in our industry. If its unwritten rulebook is anything to go by, such a film has to carry a salute of some star's voiceover in the beginning. I had assumed this well before entering the cinema hall. However Razzakar follows in others' footsteps rather disappointingly. I honestly have no grudge against it (consider Queen for example), but this badly abused narrative clearly signals the lack of creative force behind the storytelling.Let's not talk about the film's idea here - it's a clear-cut portrayal of the Hyderabad Liberation Movement that erupted in 1948. Razzakars are a private militia formed by the Nizam of Hyderabad, said to have tortured and brutally killed thousands of people who supported the state's merger with the dominion of India. The film, however, chooses not to get into this multi-layered political crisis. It instead depicts a village's and most importantly protagonist's struggle against the Razzakars - which is fair enough. Possibly being Razzakars' early representation in Marathi cinema, a lot was riding on it. The film disappoints not in parts, but in every possible way. Although what saddens me more is its failure to get its act right even at a relatively smaller scale.Characters that drive the screenplay are themselves written so amateurishly - let alone their portrayal - that the whole film appears forcible throughout. The done-to-death recurrence of - three, elderly villagers discussing the arrival of Razzakars into the village or a freedom fighter wanting to be a martyr in any given situation or a man whose jaw is wide open every now and then - make for regrettable hilarity. But above all, the unwarranted instillation of a love story signifies immature writing-direction rather evidently. Every other character performs erratically for no apparent reason causing confusion.A hen binding the story together is simply outstanding, though I am unconvinced with its shoddy depiction. The director fails to make the most of this hen to intensify his antagonist (Zakir Hussain) in the opening scene, making him appear flat rather than fearsome. The makers do resort to a number of comic moments to hold your attention, the lack of conviction though deadens it.Another crucial aspect that bothers me as much as the film's script is its not-so-terrifying violence. Razzakar is about Hyderabad's burning past; and despite having on-screen violence involving countless killings, homes set on fire, bloodshed or throat-slitting, it looks half-baked. The so-called goriness, mostly tried through visual effects, just doesn't evoke emotions.Inferior production design is another low point in the film. After all, it's very hard coming to terms with symmetrically-well-designed houses, plastic mini flags or glossy flags in 1948. This could also have to do with the film's story not offering any creative room to deepen its otherwise dull setting.Historic films are nowadays doing what history textbooks did in school. Both end up boring you, regardless of boasting adventurous moments.I couldn't connect with Siddharth Jadhav's peculiar character. His efforts indeed deserve appreciation, considering the manner in which he entertains out of nowhere. His diligent performance, on the other hand, draws your sympathy without any necessity.Razzakar suffers from poor characterization, dull portrayal and passe dialogues. There is not one single scene in which the debutant director looks promising. And lack of experience doesn't justify his insipid display.]"
16,"[It is always heartening to watch the start of an indie film. The excitement that roars from inside as you as you begin liking the film is matched by very few other experiences. Filmistaan gives you exactly that experience. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold up that well through till the end.The dialogue, the performances and the setting hook you in from the beginning. I don't remember the last time I had so many ""laugh out loud""s while watching a film. Sharib Hashmi as the Indian assistant director, who is mistakenly kidnapped by terrorists (Kumud Mishra and Gopal Dutt) and is imprisoned at a localite's, (Inaamulhaq) house, is absolutely endearing.It isn't difficult to believe that he is a well-liked character even if an Indian in a Pakistani village. Of course, as many points to the dialogue department as to Sharib Hashmi, but he charms you with his spoofy wannabe actor do. So much so that, even though Inaamulhaq gives an equally good performance, unfortunately he pales alongside Sharib Hashmi. In further comparison, Kumud Mishra and Gopal Dutt just don't have a deep enough character to even try coming close. But, the desert becomes a character that you look forward to in all the long shots. Almost as if the aridity and dustiness seep into the theater inviting you into the film.  On the other hand, the music is slightly jarring. Not that the songs are bad, just that they didn't belong to the film's genre.The real problem then comes with the second half which isn't explicitly downhill either. It's just that it becomes a little predictable with characters taking cliched routes. Four characters, four cliches. And as many predictable turn of events as there are situations. The fun yet satirical moments gradually deteriorate into ""oh we left out this obvious point.""And that drops Filmistaan from a 'do not miss' to 'watch when you can'. And that's as saddening as the beginning was heartening, because it hurts to not like a film like Filmistaan. ]"
17,"[There seems to some sort of desperate urge among producers to attempt unexplored genres in Marathi cinema of late. It is perhaps a safe bet for them. And if the subject is about sex, who is unwilling to back it? After all, such projects receive an unprecedented amount of publicity to begin with and guarantee at least return on investment in due course. Majority of them are purely box office-oriented, while few try to be remarkably different. In an endeavor to kill two birds with one stone, Chitrafit - 3.0 Megapixel ends up performing so badly that it neither appears money-making nor distinctive.The film is about victims of the illegal trade of filming and circulating sexually explicit videos or MMS. Writer-director Divakar Ghodake chooses to narrate the story through the eyes of a researcher during her visit to Pareni tribes. So he sets off the drama with the protagonist's voiceover and this is where the film begins to falter. I fail to understand why her voiceover keeps telling you the story through the viewpoints of other characters as well.The mix-up of this touching tale with a socially-ingrained message is actually the biggest cause of its failure. The lack of emotional touch to the voiceover makes you wonder if the narrator really has any heart-wrenching story to tell or is just interested in making social commentary. As the film advances, this voiceover hardly creates any suspense and instead serves you spoilers throughout.As you must have guessed by now, Chitrafit - 3.0 Megapixel is actually the name of a MMS video (meaning a film clip shot on 3.0 MP camera). This video clip interestingly opens up with a message - ""The whole event was scripted"". Appallingly, this event was scripted so shoddily that it cannot be categorized either as a film or a sex video. If the aim was to capture emotional turmoil of sexually-exploited women, the film is filled with multi-layered, confusing elements. And if the aim was to make a sex-driven film, it fails miserably.The film documents a real-life incidence that shocked rural Maharashtra few years ago, and so it is understandably set in the state's scenic ghats. A few minutes into the film, you start wondering if you are actually witnessing some National Geographic program about picturesque Western Ghats. Stunning cold frames don't add any value to the story however.In Love Sex Aur Dhoka, Dibakar Banerjee had planted cameras into his stories masterfully (except in an aspiring director's one) - letting the camera narrate the film creatively and engagingly. In Chitrafit - 3.0 Megapixel, camera's perspective (a mobile phone camera) is hardly used. Flashbacks or voiceover do little to help lay out the tale. The makers possibly didn't want to create another LSD, and this is  logical too. But a better use of camera's viewpoint would have at least stopped the film from being so predictable.Camera angles in the first MMS clip surely raise questions. If the camera is placed on ground, how in the world a high-angle shot is even filmed at an isolated place? Not only camera placements but also overall execution tells you a lot about the director's carelessness about researching the subject. Not to mention well-composed, but ruthlessly used musical pieces.Foreplay scenes are way too superficial and poorly choreographed, while videos themselves look aesthetically gorgeous - missing the realistic punch. Both Seema Azmi (Chak De fame) and Ashish Pathode are uninteresting, despite their fine appearances for respective roles. Bleak dialogue and tiring background score make matters worse, and you quickly become impatient. At just 84 minutes; this film has shorter runtime than Dhobi Ghat, still it comes with an interval. Even so, a better edit could have easily cut it down to an hour or so, eventually making this predictable film far more engaging.Ghodake has apparently been credited in several Oscar-winning films for VFX and computer graphics. Fake-looking newspapers or camera lens in his directorial debut however create doubts.If you're out there to witness some story, you'll be disappointed from the very beginning. And if you want to see it just for sex, you will regret watching it till the end.]"
18,"[You aren't expecting reality when the film is titled Luck. To top it off the font chosen for the title has diamonds and the U jets out to make a horse shoe. There's still some hope that each character's life has a passable amount of luck. But almost ALL the characters have this insurmountable amount of luck except that it's not enough for them to have enough mullah. But that too has its purpose, you see. It's so that they can play the ""biggest game"". And thus starts the ""reality show"".And this is only interval. Yes, the entire first half is shot like it is setting up the characters. And the second half is shot like it is setting up the situation, the story. I just hope the idea isn't to have a sequel ""Lucky again"". But for this one it means every character, every event, every frame is stylized. It all looks very smart. But an excess of anything is bad holds true here too. It gets tiring and overbearing. It was likely, or at the very least there was a chance that this style would have worked if the film was shorter. But no such luck! (Damn! Can I please say 'No pun intended'?) The issue was that the individual episodes in the story were not predictable, though the overall story was. Not to mention the extremely cheesy and obvious one-liners which were also translated every once in a while. The voiceover in the first five minutes should be a good give away of the non-sense that is to come. Also looks like the challenge was to have the word luck or a synonym thereof in every second sentence. And unfortunately, the writer won! An action flick, a supposed thriller - you don't really expect ace acting. And that's what you get - non-ace acting. It was disheartening to see Danny play second fiddle, especially when the last I saw him was in Frozen. The rest do their usual bit. Sanjay plays a don-like role. Imraan Khan continues from Kidnap and Chitrashi Rawat from Chak De! India. Shruti Haasan plays the sex appeal and I guess, it works. Acting I can't see. Ravi Kissen is the insufferable sleazy character. Do you feel love or hatred for any of the characters? Na-a-ah! By the way, be warned this para is sort-of giving the movie away. But it is infuriating that a writer had a serial-killer character (possibly rapist) not only escape the death sentence but also be respectfully set free! (ba-izzat bari, my ....!) Seriously, the premise and the broad sub-plots are very interesting indeed. The execution isn't all bad either. But the details in terms of characterizations or dialogues are the pits. And it makes you cry for sanity. And the climax is the mother of all ridiculous climaxes. Even for a film that is far away from reality, the climax seemed completely out of place. ]"
19,"[""A story tells you a lot about the writer."" is a running thought through Roy. Almost forcing you to think that a film tells you a lot about the director. You can tell director, Vikramjit Singh is struggling to tell his story, just like his character Kabir Grewal (Arjun Rampal), a director is struggling with his film's narrative. Roy is not a thriller. It is a romantic film. In fact, it is two romantic love stories that try hard to intertwine and mingle. Unfortunately, this connect doesn't work at all. I can imagine it having worked at the hands of a better narrator but, here you can barely see the parallels even when you are trying hard.The mystique around the two stories as is created in the trailer, is demystified very early on in the film. Only that it is not intentional. In fact, the big reveal feels neither big nor that much of a reveal when it comes about. The film lingers. Not in a good way though. It could be to accentuate the characters. All four lead characters are brooders, the male more so than the female ones. Interestingly enough, the film feels very verbose. Despite the long silences, when the characters speak, there is a good chance it is an attempt at something deep and philosophical. This is great, especially because there are very few films that can say they have non-inane dialogue. But sadness is, the lines meant to be meaningful and introspective turns out inconsequential. I have always complained that Hindi films don't have enough conversations, it has only dialogue. It is refreshing to see characters actually converse in Roy. Individually, the conversations are interesting, but they don't add up to making the film engaging. The lines are not boring but the film stretches on to ""nothing happening"". Again not in a good way.It doesn't help that the writing of the ""romance"" parts is weak. You have no clue what Aisha is on about. You know that Kabir and his character Roy are going through an internal struggle that is a source of their forlorn attitude. But, neither you nor the writers get quite a grapple over why the inner voice is  so troubled.What does keep you going despite disappointment at not being able to fathom what is happening and why are the performances. Arjun Rampal finally comes out of the wooden mould and lets his eyes speak and they speak volumes. A lot of the internal conflict you can sense is through his expression and body language rather than the character's thoughts that come out as dialogue. Jacqueline Fernandez too is less of a doll and has a little more to do with her character. It would've been great if her role was a little more detailed. The most intriguing of the lot, you could call Ranbir Kapoor's performance as holding just one expression. But there is this one scene where the hopelessness of his life turns into hope and you can see the light in his eye change without a movement of a facial muscle. But none of it good enough to make you endure 2.5 hours of ""so much talk"" leading to pretty much nothing. It is almost as if the filmmakers had a sense of this too. What else can explain the fillers in the form of songs and the fight sequence that seems to have been made just to be able to promote the film as a thriller.Even if you give the film a point or two extra for attempting something different, you can't escape the fact that it is on the borderline of making very little sense. Different ain't good enough. ]"
20,"[Once again a Hindi film makes me refer to a Marathi essay I wrote in my ninth standard. After a six-page long journey by the solider in my ""Autobiography of a Soldier"", he was abruptly released because the captors got frustrated with his silence, or like my teacher put it, the writer got bored of writing. Shamitabh's second half suffers on similar grounds, more so the climax. In addition to the technical mumbo-jumbo in the first half, even if short, is just too convenient. So, despite an attempt at a storyline different from the routine,  a lot of the writing comes across as the writers got bored and had to do some patch job to get from point A to point B. A baritone as wonderful as it is, and performances that keep you interested, make Shamitabh a just about decent watch. Shamitabh lingers a little too much, and not in the artistic, let-the-audience-take-it-in kind of a way. To the contrary, the extra moments it stays on say Rekha's face when she hears a familiar voice, actually seem to be asking the audience, ""Get it? Get it?""In fact, there was a point early in the film, where I was amused by how this old man Amitabh is being disciplined like a child by the twenty-somethings, almost like they were his parents. And lo and behold, there was a scene later in the film, that makes sure you get it. A few other Bollywood real life references, from Amitabh Bachchan's dislike for the nomenclature Bollywood to a bus conductor rising to stardom, R. Balki sprinkles the film with nods to the industry. It is cute while it lasts, but, like always references like these divert your attention from the film's story to the fact that it is a film. Same goes for product placements, as ""justifiable"" as they may be, are only blatant. With two struggling actors and a struggling director at the center, it is inevitable that Shamitabh point at at least some things wrong with the industry. From rigged award ceremonies to actors who speak for and against those depending on whether or not they got the award to actors taking control over other aspects of film-making, Shamitabh does its bit. External references and advertisements aside, techinical glitches and forced writing aside, at its heart Shamitabh is a war of brittle egos. Amitabh Sinha, the old, haggered and cranky failed actor from four decades ago is unsurprisingly wonderfully played by Amitabh Bachchan. It stumps me every time, he comes on screen two things happen - he chews the scene and yet all you can see is the character he is playing, in this case the arrogant, drunkard. It is commendable indeed that both Dhanush and Akshara Haasan hold their own in his presence. Even so, Dhanush's talent seemed under-explored and Akshara was good when she had to play herself - a young, aspirational, assistant director. The moment she is asked to do something ""filmy"", she slips and so does the scene. The guy who plays Amitabh's chaperon has a screen presence of his own too. Unforunately, the theme of ego clashes between voice and face, man and man,  one being incomplete without the other seems like a side. As is evident with what I felt like bringing up first about the film, the things that bothered rather than the concept that is rich by itself but is left unexplored. While I am a huge fan of the voice and was rapt every time I heard it; while I am a huge fan of the man to an extent that he is one of the few people I think who has earned the right to be arrogant; while I think if there is a personality whose career deserves a film, it is him - I'd like to see it in a documentary or a film that is blatantly about that. Not in a film that is masked as a story about how incomplete the voice is without a face while clearly being overwhelmed by the voice. ]"
21,"[Relationships are complex and enormously difficult. Director Swapna Waghmare Joshi probably took it to heart and determined to simplify it in a filmy way. She ends up making it puzzling and pointless. Her story appears as clueless as those relationships that have no idea of what the future holds. To make stories engrossing enough despite their repetitive nature is what a film aims for. This is where Mitwaa falters right through to the end.This so-called musical love story is quite ordinary. Shivam Sarang - a successful hotelier who hates love, marriage and commitment - falls in love with a girl afraid of relationships. Their friendship grows and so does their love for each other. But this is not it. The director brings in some tried-and-tested, formulaic twists to enthrall you. This drama, however, unfolds after exhausting you for more than an hour.Mitwaa lacks excitement, emotions, clarity and even honesty; both in its writing as well as execution. As a viewer, you are not at all part of the film's progress. You feel sidelined. As a result, you just don't care if the characters come together or grow apart. I found myself either laughing or yawning at emotional scenes. Non-linear storytelling is indeed one of several ways to grip audiences. Sadly, I feel it is being forcibly crammed into almost every other Marathi film these days. And Mitwaa is one of those. You correctly sense how the story will progress. However in order to contain predictability and make a usual story look unusual, the director chooses to spice up things with an astonishing end. Well, I must say it comes across asa  masterstroke. But as the scene advances, the efforts look over-explanatory. Meticulous direction is missing all over the film and this particular scene loses its impact just because of that.I wish I could speak about several narrative flaws in the film. As I go into details, it would eventually serve as spoilers to you.Every time I see Swapnil Joshi in a new film, his chocolate-boy image grows stronger. Blame it on the kind of films he does. This time, his spoilt-rich-playboy image emerges conflicting with his successful businessman's role. I no way mean to say that a playboy can't thrive in his professional life. The way his character is portrayed, it looks superficial. And this is the issue with all other characters too.Sonalee Kulkarni's performance is contradictory to her background story. She is brilliant as always, yet her character falls short of emotional depth at decisive moments. If you have seen her previous work, you know what she is capable of. On the other hand, careless direction kills all the charm around Prarthana Behere's Avni.Dialogues are tolerable. Swapnil Joshi must be credited for making some of the dullest dialogues sound outright witty. They undoubtedly lack sense.Camerawork is vivid and disappointing at the same time. Its is way too showy, and it doesn't serve any visual treat. It overlooks the geography of characters at more than a few instances for whatsoever reasons. A hilarious moment came when a couple sitting next to me joked about it loudly, instigating the entire theatre to burst into laughter. Though this run-of-the-mill love story is set in Goa, it fails to exploit the state's stunning locales (I don't know if the entire film was shot in Goa).Mitwaa might do more than good business, having purposefully released on the eve of Valentine's Day. Nonetheless; the film has almost nothing that can be termed as even half good, hampering all the supposed excitement.]"
22,"[Almost every character in this film has some sort of past connection with Baji, a superhero vigilante. But the manner in which all the characters are written or even presented, the film appears to be lacking enough conviction to create a long-lasting impact. Baji definitely had every potential to be one of the finest films of the year so far, yet it comes across as a dim-witted one - leaving you in a state of sulky dissatisfaction.Easily one of those films that are big on a strong idea, Baji falls short of enough strong voice to invoke your emotions or keep you engrossed throughout. Having impressed in his debut feature Pune 52, I was very curious to see what director Nikhil Mahajan does next. And Baji's promising trailer added to my mounting expectations. While I wasn't hoping for an out-and-out superhero film, I surely thought Baji  would push the envelope at least in terms of storytelling. But never in my wildest dreams did I imagine it would pave the way to mediocrity.The film is about an 11th-century legend of a masked man, who protects the dusty village of Shrirangpur. His strange disappearance for years makes the villagers wonder if this man ever really existed. But there is some mystery surrounding his existence that bridges the present world with the legend. This does sound extremely interesting; sadly all the excitement remains only on the paper (if any). It is formulaic and the shoddy writing makes it walk the path of regular potboilers.The writer-director wastes significant amount of runtime introducing characters in appealing ways, ultimately hampering the bigger picture. After an indie film, Mahajan seemingly couldn't resist the urge of making a big-budget drama full of mindless lip-sync songs. Instead of advancing the story, the choreographed dance sequences relatively obstruct its natural progression. This leads to sluggish narrative and stretches the film to an extravagant almost 3-hours.Pune 52 had its fair share of weaknesses, but Mahajan managed to impress with his original voice. He doesn't appear to have learnt from his mistakes though. He takes his slip-ups to another level instead. Cliched screenplay doesn't open up any room for improvement, let alone its strikingly predictable nature. One of the several takeaways from his previous film was long sequences in a single, continuous shot. Baji deeply misses the absence of such shots.The director's over-reliance on old-fashioned action scenes, over-the-top camerawork and dismal production values ruin his own execution in a big way. He overlooks novelty when it is neeed in some of the crucial moments. Also, the use of repetitive visuals to drive the point home was totally uncalled for. Abhijit Deshpande's editing lets down time and again.Baji is quite contrary to Pune 52's minimalistic, natural-looking lighting approach, making it appear needlessly stylistic at various points. Post interval, almost the entire village appears to be wearing black clothes for some unexplained reasons. I doubt if that really adds any symbolic value to the story.Shreyas Talpade plays Chidu's goofy character with utmost honesty; however Jitendra Joshi's outright baddy Martand stays with you. These two brilliant actors are pitted against each other, and they try their best to uplift a poorly-written film. The cameos of directors Ravi Jadhav and Nagraj Manjule were completely unconvincing. Run-of-the-mill fight sequences, loud sound and tacky visual effects fail miserably to generate the much-needed goriness. This results in an ordinary hero-villain film.Baji is certainly not awful, but it is definitely not something you would want Mahajan to do after Pune 52.]"
23,"[There's a breed among us, (numbering at least a few thousands, but who can ever know?) for whom Sulemani Keeda will resonate more than it will with anyone else - those aspiring writers in Mumbai, who dream of having their words traverse the journey from paper to celluloid (or, you know, DCP files, as is the case today).It is a tough life, that of an aspiring film-maker in Bombay, or anywhere in the world. The struggle of someone who wants to be behind the camera is surpassed only by that of one who wishes to make his name in front of it. This struggle has its share of humour as well, but that's mostly because writers are a lot who don't mind looking at the funnier side of life, even when looking at it soaring above one's head from the bottom of a pit.Amit Masurkar's film, about the lives of a screenwriter pair who dream of cracking that one script that will turn their fortunes around, is a film laced with humour, insight and a level of honesty that's hard to find. Despite the fact that certain people are bound to identify with the film more than the others, it is also a film that will connect with anyone; because every story, even one about writers, has its basis somewhere in real life.In fact, the film is quite like that popular meme which visually lists out situations like how the world sees you, how your parents see you, how you see yourself and how you actually are. It is a tiny little slice out of the journey between where one is, and where one wants to be. The journey may be fraught with disappointment and failure, but we're still at it.Our 'heroes', (though they're anything but,) are named Mainak and Dulal. Yes, they're writing a film for a big Khan. The only hitch is that they're yet to meet him. It is the little touches like these that lend a sense of comic irony to the film.Mainak is street smart and is more likely to write the kind of lines one hears in a Dabangg. Dulal, on the other hand, is an idealist, a poet, a nomad at heart. When he falls in love, he goes the whole hog. And when his heart breaks - well, I'd leave it to you to figure out what happens when a writer's heart breaks.What is most heart-warming about Sulemani Keeda is the fact that without being emphatic and jingoistic about it, it subtly subverts so many cliches that we've come to expect from a romantic comedy. The process of meeting, attraction, realizing the presence of an emotional and intellectual connect - all of it seems so much more genuine. (A big reason for this is the cast, but I'll get to that in a bit.)Even the done-to-death airport climax is dumped in favour of a sequence that's most likely how it'll be, if it were to happen in real life. Kudos, also, to the film-makers for the character of Ruma, the kind of woman you're more likely to run into in middle class Bombay than any other woman you've seen on screen. Mayank Tewari and Naveen Kasturia, who play Mainak and Dulal respectively, perform like there's no camera, as though they are Mainak and Dulal. Cinematic characters usually spend more relative time worrying about morality than real people. Director Masurkar gets it bang on, the way he treats these characters and their moral dilemmas. Mainak comes across as a likeable creep, and Dulal as the bumbling romantic. They're real people, these two, even if they're probably an amalgam of a bunch of them. Aditi Vasudeo, who plays Ruma, is an absolute natural.Admittedly, the film doesn't age as well as one would have hoped. I first watched this film over a year ago at the Mumbai Film Festival, and it seemed so much less like a low budget indie back then. In fact, it is apparent just how much of 'jugaad' - getting things done by hook or by crook - has gone into this film. Yet, that's also the beauty of it. In it's message as well as in the manner in which it was made, it is a film that inspires you to undertake the journey you seek. For only then will you have been a story.]"
24,"[All that glitters is not gold. It can also be silver or bronze. And these metals have their own charm. So Ta Ra Rum Pum glitters with the extravagant locales and the extra bright reds and blues, which don't necessarily add value to the art form that cinema is. But, it does manage to tell a regular story in a style that warms the heart. Thinking about the movie two hours after having left the theater, the first thing that comes to mind is the car races. They are timed well and executed even better. However, I would have liked more aerial shots and fewer close-ups. Who wants to see a sweaty Saif Ali Khan? Only the face shows through a helmet, gals! The races and broad story-line did remind me a lot of Naya Daur (1957), Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander (1992), Cars (2006).The next thing that comes to mind are the two cutely picturised songs. ""Ab to forever"" didn't necessarily have the most complicated dance moves, but structured choreography interspersed with normal dancing made it a delight to watch. ""tara ra rum pum, ta ra rum pum"" is by far the best picturised kids' song after ""akdam bakdam"" from Hanuman (2005). The lyrics in general, and specifically of ""Saiyaan"", restore my faith in Jaaved saahab after the Namastey London (2007) debacle.  Which leaves us with the two romantic tracks. Those are reminiscent of songs from the late 80s-early 90s and thus didn't quite fit in with the rest of the movie. Were the songs required, you ask? Have you seen the promos, dear? No? The newspaper ads with the producer's name on it? Okay-you at least know the title of the movie, right? Then, what kind of a question is that!? I seriously think the movie was named as such because they came up with that kids' song first.They did not even bother to use the perfectly valid excuse they had - Rani Mukherjee plays a singer. We have seen Rani Mukherjee have marital tiffs with Vivek Oberoi (Saathiya (2002)), Shah Rukh Khan (Chalte Chalte (2003)), Abhishek Bachchan (Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006)). Now it is Saif Ali Khan's turn. It's pretty much the same Rani here. The same Rani that makes you shut your ears when she shrieks while playing a 20 year old and warms your heart when she plays her age. Again, Saif Ali Khan does nothing path-breaking. But he sticks to the genre and doesn't go overboard.  The children give an endearing performance. At times though, Angelina Idnani (Princess) was given dialogues that were too mature for her. The voiceover especially was certainly overkill. Their characters and situation looked like it was heavily drawn from Itni Si Baat (1981), Life Is Beatiful (1997).  Someone I would have loved to see more of, would be Jaaved Jaaferi. Why wasn't he allowed to shake a leg or two? At least they gave him the best lines that he delivered with his ""Videocon Flashback"" style. Everything was just about average, acting, direction, screenplay, story, editing (it could very well have been cut short by a good 15-20 minutes). But, while I scoffed every time I was asked to suspend my disbeliefs, the scene was accompanied by a shade of creativity that kept me entertained. And gradually, without realizing it, I was rooting for R V (Saif) and didn't care how many cinematic liberties the director would have to take to make this end happily ever after. So, somewhere along the line the characters and plot touched a soft spot and I didn't want bad things to happen to them. Whether it is indeed a feel good movie or not you will have to check out for yourself. I would wait for the video if I didn't have to review this one. But if you are in the mood for well-shot car races and sweetly picturised songs, don't miss it in the theaters, and take the kids along.Correction: Earlier I mentioned ""Shakalaka Boom Boom"" instead of ""Namastey London"" in the third paragraph. Indeed, the lyrics of Shakalaka Boom Boom are written by Sameer. Thanks, Charles Foster Kane aka Antonio Ricci, for pointing it out. Apologies readers!]"
25,"[It is great to learn something that you didn't know about through a film. It is great to learn that there was a scientist who tried to get a plane to fly before the people we know it - the Wright Brothers. It is also awesome to know that the secret was written down in ancient scriptures. Whether or not it was true or has sound grounds is a matter of debate that is beyond the scope of this review. In either case, it matters not which nationality the scientist belonged to nor does it matter which religion the scriptures originated from. (Can text books belong to a religion anyway?) Was India even one nation when the text was written? But, the point of Hawaizaada seems to be to say, ""we first, we first!"" Not to mention that the film says that over more than 2.5 hours.Hawaizaada might just have passed of as a sweet story had it been shorter. A one-line plot summary would be ""A man wanted to build an airplane."" And while it alludes to the freedom struggle, family dynamics, romance etc, the film despite having one point to focus on is all over the place. The romantic moments as do the patriotic ones make you go, ""Huh? Where did that come from?"" The emotions on display are too strong compared to the mild build-up. The background music and the sets are way too theatric to make you take anything in the film seriously. The film is too bright and sharp for us to believe it is the 19th century. Sure, films themselves are to blame to make us believe that those were rustic times. But, it is distracting for sure and makes you feel you are watching a play rather than a film. The language too seems a little too contemporary. At other times times the director attempts childish comedy under the garb of Chaplin-esque. Ayushman Khurana has his charm but it is getting old now. Also, it is a rare male actor who can cry well on screen, and he is not one of them. Mithun Chakraborty carries the eccentricity well, when it is asked of him. But it is uneven - the asking, not the doing. Pallavi Sharda's existence in the film makes it a not-so brave film. If the idea was to make a film because the concept of an Indian having made the first plane to fly was so appealing why did it need the lady prop? That shows lack of conviction. With an audience that is eager to lap up any film that has novel concepts, it was worth trying this one without making it a musical. Another hint that the film tries to appeal to a populist sentiment is having Ayushman Khurana speak in Marathi. Authenticity would be a wrong argument to make because no one other than his character Shivi speaks in Marathi, including his parents. It's not like he continuously speaks in Marathi either. So, not only was the first man to fly a plane an Indian, he spoke Marathi too! It would be really sad if this move was to break the actor's North Indian boy image. Yet, I will look forward to his next film,  because he chooses films that are not the norm. And that is the only thing that works for Hawaizaada - something different was attempted. Despite all its pitfalls, Hawaizaada attempts at telling the story of a carefree, wayward, rich, spoilt brat who is also smart and sharp when it interests him. And he went on to fly a plane. Patriotism and national pride aside. ]"
26,"[Avadhoot Gupte must be a relieved man now. After all, Ek Tara is out in theatres after a year-long battle with the censors. This reason is enough to pep up the filmmaker in him momentarily, but not the audience in you. If he continues to bring films he is notorious for making, you'll be doomed to disappointment time and again. His latest film is indeed an epic of sorts. After all, when was the last time Gupte's film left you in the middle of complexity, stupidity and often nowhere?Gupte's debut feature, Zenda, was surely a brave take on a political feud between two cousins. His subsequent venture, Morya, delicately portrayed various issues surrounding Ganesh pandals in Bombay. While both the films act purposefully, they had their flaws and dullness. Never mind what happened to his raunchy love story Jai Maharashtra Dhaba, Bhatinda. Just like any other Avadhoot Gupte film, Ek Tara too has an extremely intense premise. But unlike any other Avadhoot Gupte film, this one dies from the first scene and appears futile throughout.Ek Tara (a star) deals with the rise and fall of a singer, similar to Imtiaz Ali's Rockstar. Co-writers Gupte and Sachin Darekar this time choose non-linear narrative (Ali's distinctive style) to keep you engaged. Sadly, the storytelling is so vague that you get bored too quickly and you often compare it with the Rockstar. Well; Rockstar itself was far from perfect, nonetheless this comparison reaches to a point where you feel totally disconnected with the on-screen drama. Not only does Ek Tara lack the magnitude of Ali's vision, but it also miserably fails in gratifying you.The biggest dilemma the film endures is the absence of motivation in its writing, which eventually leads to irksome execution. Consider this, the folk singer aka Mauli comes to Bombay to enter a music reality show. Odds are against him. A mean-looking channel head - who possibly has nothing else to do - lends him a hand. And he wins the competition despite his absurd style. He becomes an overnight success. This innocent guy suddenly turns into an eccentric, rampant and careless character for no apparent reason. One thing leads to another and all hell breaks loose. But why and how? If Ek Tara's tagline is anything to go by, it is supposed to be a journey of a star. But where is that journey of his rise or may be even fall? The director might argue saying the character's journey lies in between. However, his hastily-presented rise barely explains anything. Neither do you find enough justification for his fall, which begins with a silly set of events.Forced comedy and badly written dialogues add to your misery.Santosh Juvekar is a versatile actor. Yet, his poorly-shaped character sometimes comes across as whiny and a rowdy at other times. You feel nothing about his misery or glory. This makes the film lose the battle halfway.Considering the storyline, Ek Tara had every scope of becoming a musical extravaganza. The music is undoubtedly good, but it falls short of intensifying Mauli's character or the situations he is stuck in. The not-so-exceptional camerawork doesn't help the film either.Apart from a thing or two, this film proves to be one big cliche.]"
27,"[One of the main ingredients of a thriller that actually thrills ought to be a new revelation every once in a while. Zid doesn't even try. Sure, there are new things happening, but the suspects remain the same, the new events reinforce the suspicion on all the suspects equally. Interestingly enough, the reason you suspect people other than the story is trying to point a finger at vehemently, is because the film is so strongly doing so. By doing these things in combination and with a 2+ hour run-time, Zid doesn't keep your attention and you lose interest altogether by the end. Sure, the final twist is a good one, especially with what it implies about what you've been seeing so far. But unfortunately, it comes a little to late. Another thing that got to me was the spooky, horror-style treatment given to the film. We are not talking about haunted houses or unhappy, troubled spirits. So, I didn't quite understand why have an environment that makes you look out for a ghost through the film. Such horror films are known to be associated with some amount of sexual content too. Zid doesn't disappoint on the quantity it has on offer. The quality though is completely missing in terms of chemistry between the two involved. While you could fault the actors for that bit, it's not that they can't act at all. You see some hope in Karanvir Sharma because he shows great restraint when there was every scope to go over the board. While Mannara compensates for that bit by over-doing the crazy bit, every once in a while, she shows a slight change of expression which tells you she can do a good act if that's what she was directed to do. Shraddha Das on the other hand, holds just one expression - with the typical, sex-horror film glaze in her eye that every other lady in a film of this genre carries. That aside, the writing just doesn't engage you like a thriller should. It tries the known hooks that horror movies usually opt for when they know they can't keep you involved - cleavage and sex. Tells you how confident the makers were in the story they had to tell, which incidentally they try to boast about - their narrative capabilities. Unfortunately, it shows a lack thereof. ]"
28,"[You find yourself siding with a con-artist. Not just a person who dupes the other of money. She robs  emotions, feelings and wears the thievery on her sleeve. She takes offense when she hasn't been able to win someone over with her charm. She takes it up as a challenge that has to be won. Not a very likeable attitude for a person you would know in real life. Yet, you cheer for the screen her. In a sense, you feel her liberation and you are with her when she says, she might find more freedom in a prison than being locked in a marriage. Especially, given how possessive the recipients of her fake-affection get. Yet, not much of your involvement can be attributed to much about the film. It is very difficult to figure out what exacly makes you root for Dolly. The dialogue isn't very interesting, neither is  its delivery. There isn't much striking about the other departments of the film either. The music is the kind you'd find in every other film. Sonam Kapoor in the lead comes across very stiff, even a little more than her usual self. Sure, the side actors do their bit well from Rajkummar Rao to Archana Puran Singh, but none of the characters have enough depth to make themselves believable. Even a shallow character like Archana Puran Singh's can evoke an emotion if written better. It is this mixture that confuse your loyalties. The victims of the con-artists' con-job are not very likeable. Then, it all boils down to Sonam Kapoor's persona itself - the actor, not the character she plays. Her face, the fact that she is the lead lady, takes away from the film. Sure, there is nothing wrong with liking the anti-hero. But, somehow it kept me distracted through the film. I don't like the character so much, then why do I want her to get away with it? And yet again, I find myself liking a film more than I usually would because of what I didn't ""get"" about the film. The only thing I know for sure is I enjoyed the overall concept and felt a liberation of sorts with the way the film ended. ]"
29,"[It's Pakistan incessantly organizing terrorist attacks in India. It's an Indian daredevil hero, who is almost a superhero. He is single-handedly taking the enemy out. What's not to like about the story? Even if it's predictable it has enough action sequences where the bad guy gets beaten up for you to feel good about yourself as a nation. The hero's victory is somehow your victory. All of this we expected from the film. What worked for me was the heart pounding through most of the second half. Even if, this one is no A Wednesday, especially in terms of having a  relatively tight plot, Baby has a few strong sequences that keep the suspense on.In fact, the said sequences can be thought of as short stories by themselves. The episode in Nepal and then the one in Saudi Arabia were, save for a scene or two, gripping from end-to-end. And this is even when you know any sequence has only two possible outcomes. It helps that the villain seems capable of anything. He (they) is ruthless and has no regard for human life, let alone sentiment. These sequences also make the film a little episodic though. It is a good thing then that the episodes are linked to one another, even if only serially. More like bogies of a train, lacking the character of pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. There are points at which Baby seems to go high on drama, but there are many other times that were ripe for drama but it was avoided, adding an edge to the narrative. It also helps that none of the performances, except maybe the whole wife-angle, are dramatic. It is not a routine slice of life, it is the story of covert operations and spies and all things related. Yet, you cannot let go of the fact, that Baby as a film doesn't show you anything new. It keeps you glued to your seat, but does it offer something that you've never seen before? No. Does it keep you glued through and through the 2.5+ hours of the film? No. The first half makes you shift in your seat rather than bring you on the edge. Yet, by far it is one of the most thrilling films in the last year or so. I don't remember the last time I was nervous for the hero (that too, one played by Akshay Kumar) even though I knew more or less where the film was headed. To top it off, for a good hour or so. It ain't new, yet it keeps you glued. That counts for quite a bit. ]"
30,"[Edward Dmytryk once said, ""In art, the obvious is a sin."" Director Atul Kale probably doesn't understand what it really means. Had that not been the case, Balkadu wouldn't have seen the light of day. But now that this film is released, and you are in the theater you have no other option but to suffer the fruits of his sins. To put it in even simpler words - Kale falls into that brigade of directors who have no idea of anything, let alone making a film.Balkadu is an outright propaganda-driven film. Well, this is no big news to you (considering it is the lone reason the film exists) and nothing is flawed about that either. Take any well-made propaganda film for an instance; an intriguing narrative is woven around its one-sided, ideological message. It misleads you without even letting you know about it. And that's the beauty of writing, something the film's writers bluntly overlook in every single moment. But does it have at least something to brag about? A big no, unfortunately.Balkrushna Patil, who left Bombay in his teens to live in a less expensive locality - Nala Sopara, teaches history at an English-medium school that doesn't look like one. He hears voices of several Indian freedom fighters and political leaders. He sees a psychiatrist to beat this trouble, but one of the voices refuses to go away. All the unbelievable thereby starts happening. The voiceover of late Balasaheb Thackeray helps this underdog overcome his fears and stand against our corrupt system.Sounds familiar? Oh yes, it does. The film takes cues heavily from Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy, or sometimes even Lage Raho Munnabhai. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Mahatma Gandhi come alive in the aforesaid, respective films; while here Balasaheb's voiceover (the only apparent difference) single-handedly guides a common man do the impossible. Balkadu, regrettably, appears to be a ditto copycat of Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy in many ways the film ends up being ludicrous tough. What annoys me more is that Kale is seldom bothered with putting any effort to recite the same story a little differently.The makers definitely seemed to be in the mood of making things more impactful than meaningful. Okay, one can excuse logic for the sake of story. This film, however, has none. Just like Balasaheb's stiff but rib-tickling words, the film boasts some really powerful dialogues at times. He was considered as the man who says what he thought and does what he says. Being based on his ideologies, the film's story (if there's any) could have at least acted in a similar way. The outcome is rather otherwise. Because the words need the backing of action, right? Yet I have to admit this, well-timed (although excessively used) comedy is the only saving grace of this haplessly mediocre film. Irrespective of whether you agree or disagree with the portrayal of pro-Marathi agenda in Balkadu. The camerawork is something you can't forgive anytime soon. This film is about Bombay and it fails to capture the core elements that truly define the city. It instead focuses on pointless things, just as the film's editing or production do.I feel, I was needlessly harsh about Umesh Kamat's casting after seeing Balkadu's trailer. Yes; he does go a little over-the-top, yet he manages a decent job.Balkadu has everything that can be termed as superficial; even so most of the theatre was laughing, clapping or whistling at regular intervals. This reminds me of Singham. Audiences always go gaga about underdogs shaking the system. If you root for such underdogs or stand by Balasaheb's philosophy, chances are high that you already love the film.]"
31,"[""This one will be another Duniyadari. I am telling you,"" smirked a man sitting next to me at his friend. As the screening of Classmates began, I couldn't stop myself linking both the films at more than a few instances. I on't know if that guy was some astrologer or was well-versed with the films of similar genre (I smell the latter). Such a prediction may hardly surprise you; given the kind of films our industry is famous for making. Well, in a broad sense, Classmates is no way a Duniyadari spin-off; but comparisons are highly inevitable.Classmates is an official remake of 2006 Malayalam film of the same name. The original is said to be a trendsetter in the Kerala film industry. If its success can be replicated in Tamil and Telugu as well, then why not in Marathi? Remakes of films from the south are all the rage in Bollywood and Marathi industry also seems to be following suit. Not that I'm anti remakes; eventually all that matters is entertainment. But not at the cost of logic. The latest remake is filled with all possible, formulaic elements that are considered as the principle foundations of college-life films. This leaves you neither surprised nor wanting for more.A group of college students who stay out of class more than in, spends a large amount of time cracking jokes, dropping one-liners, riding bikes, dancing to the tunes of lip-synching songs or scuffling around. Enter romance, undying friendships and, most prominently, and college elections. This dramatic time actually unfolds through the old memories of these students (now ex) gathered at their reunion. Having seen multitude films set in the 90s (or even prior to that); I don't want to pick apart these ingredients, no matter how superficial they seem to me.As the narrative jumps between past and present, the only visible difference is makeup and costumes. The visual treatment of the past story is so fancy that it barely reminisces the 90s era. The production sorely misses the point here. The film largely deals with political disputes interlaced with suspense and plentiful action. Some of its moments are blatant, while some (the one right before the interval or the one that leads to climax) are simply masterstroke. You know where the story is headed to. Yet; Classmates gets increasingly intriguing post interval, one reason being correctly placed conflicts.On the contrary, the sequence - that interrelates the past and present - casting doubts on intentions - the way it is written or even executed makes the film appear as a murder thriller. Nothing wrong about that as long as it gels well with the storytelling. But if the whole aim is to make a feel-good film, then why forcibly inject things just to create suspense? This one is totally needless and is a lame effort. Unnecessarily stretched out runtime is a big disappointment too. A cleverly edited first half could have surely saved a few yawns.I must say, Ankush Chaudhari is a master performer. He once essays the role of a college heartthrob and then seamlessly gets into the character of a lost man. Though his character is another repetition of Duniyadari, he impresses throughout. Classmates, riddled with several narrative flaws, is actually made worth watching by its talented cast (look out for Pallavi Patil and Siddharth Chandekar).As I write this piece, the one thing that refuses to leave my mind is the film's background score. It reminds me of my personal favorite, The Dark Knight-themed score.In Classmates, Ankush's character addresses not-so-good things as 'small aahe (it's small)' or quality as 'darja'. His delivery makes these words sound really intense. Ironically, all the efforts fed away in the end and the picture turns as dull as it could get. Small aahe!]"
32,"[Right at the start of the The Imitation Game, the central character of Alan Turing speaks out in a voice-over, asking someone (as well as you, the audience) to pay attention to whatever is going to follow. This act, of trying to coerce the audience into paying attention and understanding what's being said &amp; shown, either by being blatant about it and stating it aloud as in this case, or by repeatedly reinforcing an already established fact or event, is perhaps the biggest problem with Morten Tyldum's film. It happens time and again throughout. If this had been avoided, and more time was devoted, instead, to unpeeling more facets of Turing's personality, the film could have been a masterclass in how to make a period biopic. Then again, the film as it is currently, still makes for a racy, engaging, at times even heartwarmingly funny, experience.Based on the life of mathematician Alan Turing, whose work in designing and building computing machines played a large part in the Allied Forces' victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, The Imitation Game works because of the stunning real life story of Turing, as well as Benedict Cumberbatch's impassioned portrayal of the man.The most brilliant minds usually belong to the loneliest, most eccentric of people. Alan Turing was what one would consider a 'deviant' in more ways than one. While the bulk of the film is spent on Turing's work in cracking the codes enciphered by the German machine Enigma, the film also flashes back to Turing's youth intermittently, as we get to know a bit of why Turing was as he was in his later years.He was an unsung hero for the longest time, Turing; so the film is emotional, edgy and always intriguing. The film also touches upon a number of sensitive topics that seem just as relevant today than they did back when Turing was alive. The casual but rampant sexism that existed back then, for instance. Again, these are only scratched at the surface.Eventually, the film does make the point that just how a man and a machine think differently, even two different individuals can think differently. Logically, it follows that there is no right and wrong, no clear moral or social lines, despite what history and society have conditioned us to believe. The Imitation Game gets the period look and feel spot on, but perhaps the biggest contributor to making it truly immersive almost throughout, is Alexandre Desplat's background score. Though it isn't the most original sounding score around, it always works in tandem with the emotional timbre of the scene, playing the role of glue between the hearts of the audience and the characters.Then, there are the performances. Benedict Cumberbatch consumes Turing (or the other way round), with every twitch, every mannerism seeming like it came from somewhere deep within. It isn't a flawless performance, only because one can see shades of his Julian Assange performance here as well. But the soul clearly overshadows the craft, leading to a thoroughly effective portrayal. The gorgeous Keira Knightley, with her crooked teeth and lanky frame, warms your heart with a performance that balances strength with vulnerability.Like I mentioned earlier, one can't help get the feeling that the film doesn't seem to want to go into what Turing really was like deep, deep inside. It delves into plenty of facts, yes, but it could have been so much more powerful if Tyldum hadn't chosen to make a simple story seem like it is a complex tale. The deepest, darkest layers of Alan Turing, it seems, are destined to be an enigma, much like the man himself. This film on his life, though, is a well-crafted, gripping film.]"
33,"[All I'd have liked to say about Tevar is that it is a typical action masala film. It's up to you what to make of it. If you like the kind of action where story is ancillary and more a matter of convenience than the core of the film, then you will enjoy this one. If not, you won't. It is in fact as simple as that.Given the film's title, by default, every character in the film carries an attitude about them, including the villain's sidekick. Except, except the lead lady. She is one who needs constant protection and taking care of. The tiny bit of attitude that she is allowed to carry for one-tenth of a second is instantaneously over-powered by someone else's attitude. The one-liner boy meets girl story has an extension - boy meets girl when she is running away from a crazy and powerful thus dangerous admirer. You would think that the extension adds just the right amount of salt and pepper to give you a decent film. But, all this is a set-up for the other kind of masala. The one which has random fist and sword fights; some long and some longer chases and a few songs to complete the circle. Though conceptually, the romance seems to be central to the plot, in reality it just feels like a fallback option, ""if we don't have them fall in love with each other, what will we do? What will they do?"" Fortunately, the actors themselves take their jobs seriously. Arjun Kapoor says his dialogue with a way too much style for my taste, but then that is what the title of the film demands. I like this avatar of Sonakshi Sinha better than her boisterous, loud-mouthed version in this genre of films. What would really be nice though, is she break through to something completely different. We will wait for that film. Manoj Bajpai, as expected, is in complete element as the eccentric, egomaniac, obsessed lover. Unfortunately, it is not because how well the character is written. It is only his doing and commitment to the character. But, it is blatant. It can be considered as a positive - that a film is very aware that it is not trying very hard to tell a story as much as it wants to show some action and that is pretty much its purpose. It doesn't quite work for me though.Which is why, Tevar is one of those. Those who want to like it, will enjoy it come what may. Others can fret and fume all they like. ]"
34,"[It is an ugly world out there, indeed. And it is not a world of under-world dons or glamorous stars - we are used to seeing the ugly sides of those worlds and pretty much know what to expect. It is that of people like (most of) us, who have seen bad times, very bad times - who at one point or another have considered a drastic step, an irrational one to relieve ourselves of our miseries. No relationship is spared, closest of bonds are questioned. Each character's selfishness is brought forth to your shock. Ugly never allows you a moment of comfort, and that's why the film is a well-made one. On the outside, Ugly is about a kidnapped 10-year old girl. About half an hour into the film, I wondered why Anurag Kashyap wrote an obnoxious, back-answering, over-smart girl who I didn't get involved with before she was kidnapped. He banks on the ""generic"" care you would have for any 10-year old girl who is kidnapped and worry on behalf of the parents. Later in the film, I wondered, is there one character I would feel my loyalties inclining towards? Nope. And that is exactly how the writer wants it. You don't like anyone at all. Who are you rooting for? But who do you root for in real life? Who do you like a 100%, a 100% of the time in real life?As the kidnapping itself takes a backseat, I was reminded of a question I have about death, ""how long does one mourn a close-one's death?"" A few days later, you have to move on with your life. After a point, that's how the characters seem to have dealt with the kidnapping. The unsaid conclusion seemed, ""If she were to be found, she'd be found by now. Since she hasn't been found yet, she must be dead. We should move on."" This seems so far removed from how you think you would react that it is shocking, disgusting. This emotion that was evoked is what makes Ugly a good film. In any other setting, with a set of different actors, Ugly would have felt like an exaggeration of dark characters. We are used to dark characters in a Anurag Kashyap film. We are used to seeing them devoid of glamor, but they usually do carry a style of their own. Here they are stripped off that. They seem so real, so possible that you accept their darkness as a part of them. They do have streaks of humanity in them, but they are either so stern (Ronit Roy as Bose) or so worn-out (Tejaswini Kolhapure as his wife) that  it is easy to accept them as empty of that humanity. In fact, another reason for Ugly to be a rare film is that the only people who seem to care is the police. Sure, their motivation is that it involves a senior's family, at one point they seem to be the only one's worried about the missing child. Watching their casual attitude turn into a serious one is a high point early in the film. The only one's doing their job and quite ruthlessly so. True to any Anurag Kashyap film the content, even if you don't like it, is so over-powering that the actors and their performances are taken for granted. Each one of us who sees the film could pick a different character and the actor who played it as the best, and each one of us would be right. I'd pick Girish Kulkarni who makes the inspector he plays his own and Rahul Bhatt as the struggling actor who wears his false pride on his sleeves as the ones who stay back with me. And of course there is gritty art work to go with the grim nature of the film and minimal to dramatic background music that only sets the tone deeper. While Mumbai lingers in the background, as the film proceeds, you might not hear it out loud but each frame seems to want to shout, ""mumbai, sapno ka shahar, jahaan koi kisi ka nahi"" - Mumbai, a city of dreams, where no relationship is sacrosanct.Also, true to any Anurag Kashyap film, it is not only about the unmasking of real people under the names of father, mother, friend, lover, but also about how rampant child kidnapping and trading is; how accepted prostitution is as a part of life; how casual an extra-marital affair is and so on. Yes, the other ugly things about life with a huge stamp of dark humor. The kind that feels unacceptable when its happening with you but brings out the laugh when it is happening to another. Exactly when does this disconnect happen?The film's content is so unsettling that you wouldn't want to watch it again, at the same time you feel like you haven't grasped it all in the first go. It is long and does seem to stall at places, over and above the lingering that is likeable. As well-made as I find a depressing film that shows you reality, I was ready to be out of the theater. After all, it does go out of its way to prove how deeply immoral we are as a society and as humans and after a point I don't want to be reminded that reality s***s. And at the same time, give me reality over gloss, any day!]"
35,"[After seeing the teaser of Lokmanya - Ek Yugpurush way back in 2012, I had doubted the film's intentions in the first place. My biggest worry was that it might end up becoming just another biopic that is high on so-called patriotic statements or the ones that question our socio-political culture. As the film begins, Nana Patekar's sarcastic voiceover (compelling, still to some extent questionable) appears to be following the latter track. This theatrical commentary continues until the intriguing showmanship unravels.A biopic on an illustrious personality faces its primary hurdle right in it's story. For people familiar with that individual, there are barely any surprises. And someone unfamiliar might feel alienated from the drama. So the real challenge of such a biopic is to appease people from both worlds. This is what Lokmanya - Ek Yugpurush uses to its advantage so masterfully that it seems the history is being replayed right in front of your eyes. No matter which world you are from, you stay gripped to that golden era throughout.If history is all you are getting to see in a film, what's the point of going to theatres? I mean, information is always a few clicks away. This is another challenge Lokmanya - Ek Yugpurush braves, all thanks to its approach to storytelling. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, fondly called as Lokmanya, played a significant role in India's freedom fight with the British. Instead of directly bombarding you with the history, director Om Raut makes you witness his struggles through the eyes of a journalist (Chinmay Mandlekar). Not only does this film succeed in depicting the magnitude of Lokmanya Tilak and his achievements, it also effectively comments on our ignorance towards his visionary ideas.Make no mistake, this film is absolutely no great piece of writing. With all due respect to its production values, this film is not even half dazzling without Subodh Bhave. I doubt if anyone (not even Raut himself) can imagine this extravaganza without him. Yes, some of the dialogues are splendid. But who is bringing them to life? Bhave has proven his mettle time and again. But this occasion, he takes his craft to another level.Direction, on the other hand, lacks persistence and meticulousness. Some of the sequences are needlessly glorified. Several key elements surely help disguise a few casual moments (read mistakes). But no blunder comes close to the choice as well as the quality of visual effects. Some galaxy-like effects at the Mandalay Prison make the whole effort look stupid. I don't know if the director wanted to give a divine feel to Tilak's character. However, his character itself is so powerful that the rest of the glorification appears irrelevant.Raut forcibly spoon-feeds you almost everything. His eagerness to give away an outdated (still popularly overused) conclusion, questions viewers' sensibilities. Had he let audiences perceive the film's takeaway, it would have had more impact.Yet, despite all the downsides, Lokmanya - Ek Yugpurush leaves you with a gratifying experience.]"
36,"[Children's minds are full of fantasies, wonders, adventures and probably what not. They fancy the world as a fairyland and build their own around it. Their wings don't need spaceships to traverse through galaxies. The universe becomes a never-ending canvas, where the colours of their dreams fearlessly portray their desires to achieve impossibilities. Even the tiniest thing turns into a matter of obsession for them. Indeed, it makes for a fascinating story. Avatarachi Goshta tries to capture that craze in an absolutely candid manner, sometimes even reviving your own childhood memories. Alas, the film fails to get a lot of mileage out of its compelling story.The soul of this film lies in the Dashavtar tales from Indian mythology. Kaustubh - an innocent, little boy - finds a strong resonance with these stories. He tirelessly listens to Lord Vishnu's folkloric adventures. His granny once tells him that Vishnu will take a human avatar - the Kalki, to destroy the darkness of Kaliyuga (the present era). One thing leads to another and Kaustubh feels that he is none other than the Kalki avatar. what happens next is surely worth exploring. And this is despite prolonged dullness in the film's writing as well as execution.Avatarachi Goshta is adorned with innocence and has plenty of funny elements up its sleeves. It doesn't turn out to be a laugh riot though. The subtleness in comic moments goes in the film's favour. Nevertheless, it also ends up disappointing you in the long run. Lengthy sequences between Kaustubh and Amod (Adinath Kothare) could've been far more bearable, had they not lacked humorous touch. Well, you don't essentially require comedy to stay hooked to a film. This one, however, badly needed some solid, crisp dialogues.Writer-director Nitin Dixit tries really hard to make it engrossing, and some of the moments even set up for an inspirational ending. He smartly captures the insecurities faced by kids. Thankfully, he doesn't go detailing their problems. But his efforts fall short and create philosophical noise instead. Dixit's directional style is good, but not exceptional. His minor mistakes (really minor to even notice) hamper the story's freshness, making the film a little sluggish and tedious. Mihiresh Joshi plays Kaustubh's part very well. Had he been guided diligently, he could've been more impactful. Yet, I am glad to see Kothare in such a natural role. Not that he is an  excellent actor. Nonetheless, this atheist tenant looks significantly convincing than the chocolate-boy in his last film Premasathi Coming Suun.After seeing the film's trailer, I was quite impressed with its camerawork. Yes; it tries to be stunning right from the beginning, and pretty much succeeds in its endeavours as well. Unfortunately, it lacks purpose. It is not that Avatarachi Goshta fails. In fact, it is one of refreshing stories of the year. But the problem is that you won't live with it in the time to come.]"
37,"[Rajkumar Hirani has a knack for attacking a problem headon but with a smile. As usual the issue is important, and given the events of this week, it is of global significance, though PK doesn't necessarily spread its wings that far. While the jokes are slightly on the lame side, the point made is powerful even if readers of this site might not be the direct target audience for the arguments.Most of the citybred, Generation Next a la the multiplex audience is already on the story-tellers' side. We would make the same arguments in a coffee table conversation. But the beauty here is Hirani keeps it simple. With single-minded focus he attacks the problem, quite literally, using child-like innocence. His use of humor, didn't make me laugh or even smile, but the entire theater was in splits, especially most of the first half. For matters of such importance, that most people are getting more and more right of center about without thinking it through, it is just important to get the audience to listen. So, whatever works. What worked for me the most is that PK was PK and not Aamir Khan. Sure, his mannerisms did feel a little exaggerated but they became a part of the character. After a long, long while a character he played didn't remind me it was him. In fact, while jotting my notes, at one point I found myself writing Anushka Sharma to PK! That form me was another victory for the film. Not that Anushka Sharma didn't perform well, it was easier to remember her as the actor rather than the character. A lot of the other players too - Saurabh Shukla, Boman Irani, Parikshit Sahni keep the film on its mark without attracting too much attention towards them, which is no small feat in itself. Else, Hindi films are so proficient at making caricatures out of Godmen that it is a welcome relief when it doesn't happen.But, PK is not one of those films that would need extra points for what it didn't do. It has enough going for it. Rajkumar Hirani films aren't great works of cinema in terms of other departments of filmmaking. They keep their background music, camerawork, post production to the minimum. Their focus is on the writing, (with a few diversions in form of songs and a romantic track). And they don't even rely too much on subtlety and symbolism.In fact, these are films when the characters are as uni-dimensional as they get. Also, ironically, you have to take major leaps of faith as the films have a boatload of flaws and over-simplifies complex issues. It is irksome at most times, yet you are willing to let it go. Because the films say it like it is, and keep you engaged while making a point without becoming too preachy. That in itself is a full plate. Fortunately or unfortunately, sometimes that doesn't bring anything new to a person who is on the same side of the argument. The same concern I had with OMG Oh My God. Blind faith and misuse of blind faith that feeds on fear is something we have to deal with on a day-to-day basis. So, the points made in and by PK are drawing room conversations you and I might have had umpteen number of times. It's good to see our point of view represented and presented in a manner that should make sense to those who follow God and more importantly Godmen blindly. I would applaud it for finding the balance and not defying the existence of a supreme power. To say the film focussed only on one religion would be completely missing the point. It is up to us to extrapolate it to the religion of our choice, including our own. How many of us will ""get it"" and be able to internalise it is a completely different question altogether. Every Hirani film coins a phrase that eventually becomes common parlance, ""jaadu ki jhappi"", ""all is well"", ""Gandhigiri"" and now ""wrong number"". Fortunately, one you don't mind taking. ]"
38,"[Premasathi Coming Suun is not a children's film (not that it is inappropriate for them). But everything about this comedy film is so childish that even kids would laugh at it. It's a sheer waste of money not only for its producers, but also for viewers.The film is an uninspiring rom-com of a young man, who gets married to a gorgeous woman chosen by his grandmother. This bride, however, has a hidden agenda. As the groom's family discovers her secret subsequently, it's you who ridicule the moment more than anyone. Nobody really cares if a film is inspired (or copied) by other films as long as it moves you or brings smiles to your face. Unfortunately; this immaturely-written, predictable film kills your excitement at every point.The prevalent issue of Premasathi Coming Suun is that it lacks sincerity. Director Ankur Kakatkar seems to be more concerned about how stunning his leading lady Neha Pendse looks. Unfortunately, it leads to lacklustre display on every front. Pathetic story, incongruous sequences, lame direction, futile production - you name it and the film has it. Regrettably, what the film doesn't have is a single scene that can make you sympathise with the protagonists' emotional state or hook you.Premasathi Coming Suun is another fine example of mundane films that remind you of over-exaggerated acts like in theater. In fact, this film occasionally appears to be one such play projected on celluloid. None of the actors show their true grit to at least help you tolerate this bizarre narrative. The lack of prudent writing is certainly at fault for their crippled performances. The buck stops at Kakatkar.The makers' heavy reliance on tedious one-liners and punch lines falls flat on their faces. It is high time our filmmakers realised the seriousness of comedy. A closer look at Marathi comedies released in the recent past reveals that they all look prosaic; all thanks to worn-out, rhymed lines. I am not at all against such dialogue, but their overuse is an issue. A fresh approach on this front is a must.If all this torture wasn't enough, out of place songs make matter worse for you. Move over Sheila and Munni, because Gulabo has come to grab all your attention. This particular song could have been easily edited out.Give this film a miss unless you want to pull your hair out.]"
39,"[There is only so much that the searing, blistering persona of India's biggest superstar can do, when the film surrounding him is an ordinarily written, poorly directed and shoddily produced mess. The fact that Lingaa, directed by K. S. Ravikumar (director of one of Thalaiva's biggest hits, Padayappa,) is unworthy of the phenomenon that is Superstar Rajnikanth is no surprise, because very few films are. The disappointment lies in the fact that it fails to enhance or add to the legend of the great man - something that every 'commercial' film built around him now must strive to do.It can't be too hard, really. The very presence of Thalaiva means his fans will lap up absolutely everything with unconditional joy. Why not risk doing something that will push the envelope to unheard of places - the kind that will take Indian cinema itself to the next level? Shankar - the only Indian director who at least comes close to possessing the vision to match the Rajni aura - did it to some extent with Sivaji - The Boss and Endhiran. Even Soundarya's Kochadaiyyan was a film that at least tried something unheard of in Indian cinema. In the wake of these films, Lingaa is an unmitigated disaster, when seen purely in cinematic terms.The strange thing is that one can't accuse the film of not having a story, because it has one, and it is one that had potential. A thieving hoodlum and his sidekicks come to a village that depends on a dam for its livelihood - a dam that is tied intricately with an aspect of the man's past. There's a plot angle that it shares with Kochadaiyyan as well, though I don't want to reveal it here. Not revolutionary, but the story definitely had potential - especially since it gives the film a lot of openings to talk about issues that have been plaguing India all through its past and continue to do so even today.Thalaiva gets to play saviour yet again, and that's always fun to watch. The problem lies in the juvenile screenplay and some truly atrocious VFX - the kind that an intern at a mid-level animation house would be able to achieve with some amount of hard work. The film has so many in-jokes, so many references and hat-tips to the Thalaiva legacy, that it becomes hard to take seriously at any point. Superstar is what he is because of the characters he plays in cinema. To have a film that tries to be too clever with its references means that you're always breaking the illusion for the audience. They may be clap-traps, but they destroy the film in the long run.Another disappointment are the regressive sidetracks involving women. One would love to see a Rajnikanth film where the women have something to do apart from being objects of curiosity, and I'm sure Thalaiva himself would gladly acquiesce to be a part of such a film. Even the most hardcore and male chauvinistic Thalaiva fans wouldn't mind seeing him do such a film. The problem is the filmmakers who make their living by mooching off the Thalaiva aura clearly don't seem to think that women matter in the larger scheme of things. Sonakshi Sinha, who plays one of the two female leads in the film, plays the same ditzy girl she plays in every film that she's been a part of, save for Lootera. I'm surprised she hasn't exploded yet with the weight of the sheer same-ness of her existence.Is there a redeeming factor in the film? Of course there is - Superstar Rajnikanth himself. His screen presence is blinding, the conviction with which he emotes is inspiring, and the pure magic that can be the only explanation for the unlikeliest man becoming India's biggest screen god is on full display. There's no one like Superstar Rajnikanth simply because there is nobody like Superstar Rajnikanth. Everything else, including K. S. Ravikumar's slipshod film, pales away. ]"
40,"[What can you say about a film made on a true-life disaster? Not a natural disaster. A disaster created more by human apathy than by greed; more by turning a blind eye to the things you can fix than keeping yourself covered; more by believing you are doing the right thing than by convincing yourself that you did your due diligence; more by shirking your responsibilities than by being unapologetic about your negligences. The incident itself was of course unfortunate, and Bhopal - A Prayer for Rain brings about the events that led up to the eventual disaster in an engaging format.That's the problem with commenting about such films. People died and are suffering 30 years later. And how what I have to say is that the film was ""engaging"". What do I say? Rajpal Yadav and Tannishta Chatterjee did a wonderful job of playing Dilip, a Carbider and Leela, his wife as representatives of thousands of workers/families who died in the gas leak and its aftermath?Sure, the camerawork created claustrophobia and not only in the climax scenes. Throughout the film there is a sense of foreboding, a feeling that you are crammed in place which you can't get out of. This comes through even in the long shots of the slum areas and the city of Bhopal in general. It is interesting indeed that director, Ravi Kumar picked a story format over making a documentary. In fact, he adds a touch of dark humor too, in the beginning. The stories of Dilip, Leela and a few more characters which are based on real-life characters keep things as close to reality as possible. Though Warren Anderson's character seemed rather muted and ambiguous through the film. It was difficult to make out what his stand was, maybe a good shade of grey that he really was. Yet, it didn't feel complete. But, the film gives you space to absorb. Not only the technical details - which I am sure they must've over-simplified for the sake of consumption/or because of lack of available data - but also the dynamics that go on in a real life situation. Between politicians and businessmen, between workers and superiors, across races. As you see the Indians on-screen being enamored by anything American, you try to discount the fact that this was 30 years ago, and Indians were indeed in awe of any human with white skin. And then, you wonder. Would my blood boil less as the end credits rolled, if Union Carbide was an Indian company? Does it matter that one of the main reasons (as pointed out in the film) for the disaster was because of an Indian solution, a (jugaad of sorts? Are the senior employees, Indians included, less responsible for the gross negligence that they allowed? And then, you wonder, so what if I get the answers to my questions. What will change? What will I do? The fact that the film made me think, is its success, of course. As I walked out of the theater, I overheard a young girl say over her phone, ""Oh I need to take a break, I just saw a very sad film."" Should I then be saddened further because my cynicism was just reinforced? Or should I be happy that at least the girl came down to see this film? How does one respond to such a film? At the very least by watching it first?~ ~ ~ps. I saw the Hindi version of the film. I must say Martin Sheen speaking in Hindi is very distracting. But, most of the characters are Indians, so it's not that bad once you get past the dubbing.]"
41,"[Even if I know what to expect, and even if I know better than to expect any sort of entertainment from this crew, in this genre, I end up hoping to like at least something in it. I know its not the film's fault, and I have to suffer the brunt of my personality. But I did end up being more disappointed than I was expecting to be, is the best way I can put it. There are two-three things that I was actually pleasantly surprised to find in the film. Some sort of an attempt at a story, even if it comes only in the second half. The first half is as random as can be. And the stylish editing and general post-production of the action pieces. The color saturation and grungy look is ironically fresh because it is rare in Hindi films. Then you have the obsessive, almost obsessed vamp - as hardcore as vamps get, induces more fear than the ""main"" villain. But, none of these, except maybe for the vamp serve any specific purpose. They look more like they are incidental to the main objective of the film - displaying action by Ajay Devgn. So, the story seems like it exists because a part of the audience has silly expectations like a story line. The x-factor in the action sequences seem like they exist because the filmmakers wanted to have them and it didn't matter whether it fit in the texture of the rest of the film - which incidentally it didn't. Not to mention, I wondered more than once, if they were covering up for the lack of creativity in the action choreography department. The obsessive vamp then leaves you with very little in terms of hope. The supposed comedy doesn't bring half a smile. The dance sequences are way too generic for a film with the name Prabhu Deva attached to it. The lead ladies Sonakshi Sinha and Yami Gautam are as perfunctory as they could get. It all boils down to - does Ajay Devgn pulls the film through then? Well, yes and no. Yes, for those of us who don't mind what the film is about as long as Ajay Devgn is pulling his stunts right. No, obviously for the rest of us. I've had enough films that are banking on one star's stardom to pull an entire 2-2.5 hour film through - be it Akshay Kumar, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan or my personal favorite Ajay Devgn. Sure most of them have either action, romance or a social message as the other anchor in the film. But, I know I've had enough. Aren't the actors done with these films that seem like it is more about them, the STAR?]"
42,"[Most of us have probably heard the story of the man who, many, many years back, was thrown out of a train compartment that he had a rightful ticket to. The man went on to become a rallying point for an entire nation that wished to free itself from colonial rule. If you pause to think, you do wonder whether India would've attained independence if Mohandas Gandhi had been less affronted by the apartheid and racism he faced.The Hunger Games series and its heroine, Katniss Everdeen, are much the same, really. Katniss never wanted to rebel against the oppressive regime that Panem was under. All she wanted to do was protect her sister. Yet, that one little act thrust her into the spotlight, as, by the end of the second film, she became the symbol of rebellion against the Capitol. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 begins almost exactly where Catching Fire left off. Katniss, if you remember, inadvertently disarmed the force field enveloping the arena holding the Games. She was then air-lifted by a group of rebels, much to her chagrin. If you don't have the first clue what I'm talking about, then this film isn't for you anyway, because it makes little attempt to refresh memories. The whole film has been treated with the assumption that the audience is familiar with the first two films (and why not?)More than the first two films, it is this third film in the four-part movie series that really provides an insight into what kind of a person Katniss Everdeen is. It also once again reinforces the sheer talent that Jennifer Lawrence is. One almost feels that if J Law were to face the same situations in real life that Katniss feels in the film, she'd probably react the exact same way. I keep coming back to the word that I always like to use for both the actor and her character - 'spunky'. Righteous, but never self-righteous; shaky but never nervous; angry, but almost never out of control; Katniss is a heroine you'll love more, the more you watch her.Apart from her, though (and the presence of one Phillip Seymour Hoffman), there's little in the film that makes it a must-watch all by itself. It is unavoidable if you're watching the franchise, but it also really conveys very little new, apart from what we figured at the end of Catching Fire - that a revolution is brewing, and Katniss is the Mockingjay - the symbol of this revolution.What's most disappointing about Mockingjay Part 1 is that there is very little action in the film; in fact, there isn't a single large action set piece, just a few isolated little scenes. Yet, what it lacks in action and thrills, it tries to make up for with little things, like an interesting sub-plot about Katniss being filmed for propaganda purposes, with a Leni Riefenstahl-ish female director to boot. Still, nothing can quite make up for the disappointment of not getting to see Everdeen display too much of her archery skills - one of the highlights of the earlier films.Director Francis Lawrence handles the film like a mixed bag. He seems to have a grip over the emotional graph he wants to follow, but the arc of the film itself actually does so little for the overall story, that you sometimes wonder if the novel Mockingjay could have just been made into one film, to neatly wrap the series up as a trilogy. The first two films saw Katniss make giant leaps as she revealed her nerves of steel, her unabashed virtuousness and fierce talent. This one, well, it just seems like a place holder. Hopefully, all the fireworks, excitement and thrill have been left for the final film, which will take us to the conclusion of Katniss Everdeen and Panem's fight for freedom - the kind of fight we're subconsciously so familiar with, but which will always resonate if done well. But for that, Mockingjay Part 2 will have to go many, many notches above Part 1.]"
43,"[If you've watched The Wolf of Wall Street; if you're hooked on to True Detective, and if you know a little bit about Chris Nolan's upcoming film Interstellar, then you know that Matthew McConaughey is on a bit of a roll. His physical transformations are a wonder in themselves; but what is truly special is how he moulds himself into the quirky but vastly different characters that he does. In Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof, a gruff Texan homophobe who discovers that he has AIDS, and is told by the doctor that, based on his current condition, he has 30 days to live. Woodroof, however, has no plans to kick the bucket so soon; so he decides to take matters into his own hands.Dallas Buyers Club creeps up on you slowly. It is a stark, disturbing film at times, and oddly charming at others. Ron Woodroof's story is undoubtedly inspiring - a shining example of how just one's attitude and outlook can go such a long way in improving the quality of life. The film is set primarily in the mid-80s, when AIDS was still a mystery, and it was surrounded by a number of myths that have since been debunked. Thus, the film also has plenty of important social messages in it. It reminds you that life doesn't have to be tragic and restricted if you're affected by HIV or AIDS. Also, watching Ron Woodroof's graph of being absolutely homophobic, one who is appalled by the mere thought of homosexuality, to then ending up having a deep friendship with the unlikeliest of people, his character wins you over every step of the way.The film's best moments, though, are easily the David and Goliath battle that Ron Woodroof fights with an unfair government agency - which you'll discover in the film. Even though you're not strictly supportive of the moral implications of Woodroof's actions, you support him, because everyone fundamentally identifies with a key driving thought for all of humankind - that everyone has the right to choose their own way of life. As mentioned earlier, McConaughey's lean look is a wonder indeed, but it isn't a patch on Jared Leto's transformation into the transgender Rayon. In fact, it was only in the close credits that I realized it was him. A brave role and a marvellous effort in slipping in to character, Leto is simple terrific. Jennifer Garner as the kindly doctor who sympathizes with Woodroof is also superb.We're so used to rooting for white characters, that we tend to forget that we're all actually grey. Dallas Buyers Club reminds us of the fact that in real life, we're all grey, and yet some of us lead lives that are worth living and worth dying for. It entertains you, moves you and educates you, just like that.]"
44,"[Time is strange, that way. It waits for no one, but it also always catches up with you. When it does, you're usually left rueing the past or dreading the future. In Alexander Payne's unhurried, warm Nebraska, an old man with a shaky past, a bleak future and questionable mental abilities has his heart set on a wild goose chase - a supposed windfall that he's sure of - which will take him from Montana to Nebraska. Stubborn and unrelenting as he is, one of his two sons decides to humour him and take him along, because he just doesn't know how long his father will live anyway.There is such joy in seeing a filmmaker who knows his characters and their stories so well, that he sees no need to push things and make them happen. Nebraska is funny, slow, gentle and moving. It explores so many different kinds of relationships in a family, as well in the extended family.The most endearing among them is that of father and son. David, the son, has personal problems as well, but he puts it all on the side to concentrate on his father. The father, a brash, near-senile old fellow with a drinking problem, doesn't give much to make you like him. Yet, the sight of his son doing so much for his father never once strikes a false note; because you can see that on some level he's terrified at the thought of his own old age, when it sets upon him.Also, since the film is largely set in a small town called Hawthorne in Nebraska, it also has some genuinely insightful moments that show how a sleepy, close-knit town is almost like one gigantic joint family, unlike in large cities where you're alone even if you're in a crowd. Shot in gorgeous black-and-white and with a folksy soundtrack as company, the film exudes a charm that harks back to the days of old.Like in his previous film The Descendants, Alexander Payne seems to have this wonderful quality of creating memorable scenes in the unlikeliest of settings. In Nebraska, watch out for a few of them set in places you'd least expect - a cemetary, for example.Veteran actor Bruce Dern, in his Oscar-nominated turn as the father Woody in Nebraska, is quite terrific. He has to alternately display spurts of comprehension with stretches of being lost, and he does it so convincingly. He also almost always has you interested in the reason he wants to visit Nebraska in the first place, despite everyone close to him telling him that he's off his rocker. However, despite Bruce Dern walking away with nominations and accolades for this one, the film is actually shouldered almost entirely by Will Forte, who plays David. The film is essentially David's story; the graph, the growth, the resolution, they're all his. Reminiscent, strangely, of a young Quentin Tarantino, Forte's straight face as he tackles some complex scenes may have been the reason why it may appear that he hasn't put in as much as Dern, but fact is that Forte holds the film together. His is a severely underrated performance. As the journey of the film unspools itself gently, you find yourself not knowing whether to smile or feel sorry for Woody and David. Eventually, though, despite the note the film ends on sticking out a wee bit from the rest of the film, the unsaid feelings of love and respect they have for each other hit home. You're left feeling that, for all of us, there is still hope.]"
45,"[""Common man and his angst"" I don't think this topic is getting old in India any time soon. Especially, if there are new ideas, how much ever impractical they might be. And new, easily palatable solutions, which even more easily invoke activism is exactly what Ungli offers.The impressive thing about the writing is that it not only picks topics that you and I encounter on a day-to-day basis and provide its own style of solution. It goes a little beyond. It creates an intriguing character and gives the character a dilemma - a real dilemma that you can see him fighting within. That doesn't take away from the fact that the ""ungli activism"" episodes themselves are pretty well thought out. I especially enjoyed the rickshaw episode. No, not because it is closer to heart. Maybe a little because they picked an issue that involved civic sense. Maybe a little more because it was not against the usual suspects - politicians/law enforcement. Even a little more because they dared to point a finger at the not-so-rich class. But, the most because of the point in the story that it is done. And how, these facts - that the target is not the typical ones and not rich creates unforeseen complications. Also this triggers a change in the dynamics of the relationships between other characters.Such slight detail in writing is so rare in Hindi films, especially the mainstream films that I take delight in them. It comes as an icing on the cake, when the performances are mostly restrained and there's no melodrama. Of course, the whole ""angst"" bit does come across as dramatic at some points. But then again, I can see myself getting worked up as much, when I see a car halting in the middle of the road to drop someone off. Here, the issues were larger and the reasons too. Randeep Hooda, Emraan Hashmi, Angad Bedi and Neil Bhopalam all play their bits well and actually look like real people in the real world. Maybe that self-referencing line by Emraan Hashmi could've been avoided because it just reminds you of the actor rather than keep him character.On the other hand, I liked the fact that Neha Dhupia and Kangna Ranaut who came into the industry banking heavily or used heavily for their oomph-factor, are now slowly taking on non-glam avatars. Just that neither of them wore anything blingy was good enough too. I guess it was too  much to ask the makers to avoid an item number. Shraddha Kapoor trying to make a some point with her appearance as a bar dancer. An item number that doesn't even have her lip-sync one line properly while the man in the song does the honors. These things in the beginning of the film make you a little wary of what's to come. But as the movie proceeds, such annoying bits are kept at bay and you settle in. And you actually get involved. An engaging film Ungli is. But like observed in another film not too long ago, ""Human behavior and life doesn't change in 3 hours.""]"
46,"[Every once in a while; you come across a film that promises to be something, yet turns out to be entirely different. Happy Journey falls in such a category, but thankfully in a pleasant way. Its trailer tries to be very straightforward. The film, rather, deals with a journey of self-discovery, filled with complexities. It not only surpasses the expectations set by its trailer, but also manages to surprise you every now and then. It won't be an overstatement if I call this as an achievement; considering the fact that this film is not free of conventionalism.After forgettable Aiyyaa, Sachin Kundalkar brings you a heart-warming tale of two siblings. Niranjan (played impeccably by Atul Kulkarni), when he was just a kid, was sent to Dubai to financially support his family. As a result, he hardly met his sister Janaki over the years. They meet again in unusual circumstances and set off on an extraordinary journey of life.Just like many other films of its genre, Happy Journey chooses the path of a physical journey. But what makes this film so unique is that it's more of an emotional journey-. The writer-director makes you laugh even in an utterly serious situation and leaves you speechless when you least expect it. He strikes a perfect balance of situational humour and emotional bond with ease. This actually tells you the level of efforts that went behind the film's writing.Self-discovery films usually land up making melodramatic or philosophical statements. This story strongly avoids it, and rightfully so. Kundalkar understands his protagonists' world very well. He doesn't let the focus slip away. Although Pallavi Subhash's Goan accent initially gets a little hard to adjust to, she does it brilliantly. Secondary characters and a few flimsy moments, however, expose the director's vulnerability. It is undeniably regrettable.Another prominent aspect of this refreshingly beautiful story is the coming-of-age relationship between a brother and his sister. I don't remember a sister being so convincingly bold, especially in a Marathi film. Priya Bapat delightfully lives up to her role. Shalmali Kholgade's soulful lullaby - Aakash Jhale, adds a heart-rending layer to her character.Happy Journey looks gorgeous, yet its cinematic beauty remains evident only in parts. Nevertheless, the film is such a joyful experience that you can't afford not to go on its journey.]"
47,"[Happy Ending is not a sex comedy after all, though its trailer tried its best in portraying itself as one. It is a regular rom-com that truly has its heart in trying to differentiate itself from others in its genre. It manages, even if only by a bit. Let's face it. The dynamics of relationships are changing. Love is no more as ""forever"" a thing as it used to be thought of as. More and more of today's urban youth believes in ""the one"" for them, at this current point, on this day, this part of life. Of course, I have no statistics, but this is the general perception I see from younger friends and family. And this is what both Yudi (Saif Ali Khan) and Aanchal (Ileana D'Cruz) experience and live by.Yes, it does sound cynical. What happens when two cynics who don't believe in ""happily ever after"" but are romantic and enthusiastic about relationships otherwise bump into each other? It's not they don't like relationships but both like retiring from them when it's at its peak, after the initial excitement, before the us become 'you' and 'me'. Maybe the excitement just lives on because both don't want it to end. Maybe they let it just be instead of tinkering around with it to make it ""work"".In this sense, Happy Ending is different. It is a romcom that makes you reconsider the basics, like say ""opposites attract"". Though you might not think to deeply about it. And that is because it tries to do a lot many other things. For one, it wants to make you laugh, which it manages a few times; some times out loud too. It wants you to go ""aawww"" and care for the characters, root for them to be together, even if they aren't too sure about it. This, by definitions of romcom, is fine. Then, Happy Ending tries to become more. It wants to point a finger at both the ""Star-driven"" Hindi film industry and it wants to nod a cynical smile at the parallel indie film ""hatke"" (different) movement in the industry. Some of these things work wonderfully, while others fall flat.Some of the one-liners are brilliant and will stay with me for a long, long time and I would love to watch them again in the given context. Also, Govinda does his exaggerated bit as a ""star"" who runs the show pretty well. Ileana D'Cruz is charming as usual yet, her expressions always come across as functional and self-conscious, thus never too convincing. Kalki Koechlin seems to be on repeat mode from her appropriately annoying role in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. You can say the same about Saif Ali Khan from the dozen films where he's played the city-bred non-commital lady-charmer. Except, when he shows up as his character, Yudi's alter ego. His accent, his demeanour, his attitude and his sense of responsibility towards Yudi keep you in splits while being perceptive and introspective.It is the times when the film self-references that it digs itself a hole. Films that are satirical of the film industry that they belong to cannot do the same things that they are being satirical about. If you are poking fun at films breaking into songs in a formulaic manner, you cannot yourself have songs as expected. Similarly, I have never been fond of films that remind you that you are watching a film. Happy ending does this by breaking the fourth wall every once in a while. Except for one time that Yudi's alter ego makes Yudi aware of the audience's existence, where it is done meaningfully, it is annoying. Yet, you have to give points to Happy Ending for at least trying to be different, even if not whole-heartedly.  There are a few points in the film where you catch yourself inadvertently thinking a little deeper about love and its place in our world today. For me, that by itself is an achievement. Sure, I might not need a film to get me thinking about love and relationships, but it feels good when one gets you to. Think about it, if everything around you is changing, if nothing is permanent, if the only constant in life is change, can love be permanent? The romantic in me wants to believe that the answer to be, ""yes, despite all odds yes."" But, I'm willing to hear a more contemporary side of the story, if someone tells it to me right.  Whether or not they have a happy ending. ]"
48,"[Antoine Fuqua, whose last film Olympus Has Fallen was as silly as it could get, has made a dramatic u-turn with The Equalizer. A calculated, dark film with Denzel Washington playing the kind of character he's almost come to be synonymous with, the film often gives you a sense of deja vu - but not always in a good way. The Equalizer is a rather strange film, to be honest. A dark thriller can either be racy, or it can be measured. Fuqua chooses the latter path, and takes it to the extreme. No surprises, no heart-in-your-mouth moments, no twists to grab at you - nothing. Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall - a regular man with a seemingly regular life, which he makes an attempt at living like clockwork. But he has a past, McCall - and it comes to the fore when the situation calls for it.Everything in the film is understated - the humour, the gloss, the grunge - all of it. Washington's McCall is a cool customer at all times; yet he knows how to wield not just regular weapons, but ordinary household object as weapons as well. The reason for it, McCall's back story is only hinted at. We never get to know why he went from some sort of special-ops or military to living a staid, lonely life. Presumably, he's done stuff he's either ashamed of or regretful for.And then, we never quite know why McCall turns it around again, as the events of the film unfold. Perhaps it's him feeling sorry for a character who, from his perspective, is having it rough. Or it is just a case of a leopard not being able to change its spots. Either way, McCall takes it on himself to fight injustice and evil when he sees it, in a manner that he deems fit.Denzel Washington, and indeed Robert McCall, are ice cool in more ways than one. A Sherlock-esque ability to read situations; a pleasant, fatherly demeanour; deadly fighting skills - he's a perfect movie character, in a manner that confuses even other characters in the film. It is in this aspect, of straddling a realistic and edgy treatment style with out-and-out 'movie' characters, where The Equalizer stumbles often.Everything seems to be carefully planned out. When one deliberately chooses a realistic tone to treat the film, the tone lends itself to a feeling of unpredictability, of not knowing what might happen next. But with The Equalizer, that never happens, because with characters like these, you know exactly what's going to happen. It doesn't help that Fuqua further inserts 'cool' cinema techniques like the slow motion and rapid cuts once in a while.The film thus ends up becoming most fascinating only on paper, particularly with its title. It's an unequal world; a world of haves and haves-not; a world where someone is always one-up on someone else. In such a world, you need someone to bring that balance, to even things out a bit. To equalize.Trapped in his own image, Denzel Washington still manages to rise above that and seem like the guy you'd want on your side when the odds are stacked against you. But in walking the tightrope between the real and the reel, you end up confused about whether the directionless journey of this character really amounts to much.With all of this and the slow pace of the film, you often begin to think of the point of it all. The shot-taking begins to seem redundant, all of it seems like a soulless exercise, and it leaves you feeling distant and uninvolved. Bad guys who're good and good guys who're bad - both kinds make for fascinating movie characters if they manage to touch your heart. The Equalizer makes sense for the most, but it just doesn't touch the heart.]"
49,"[There is at least one generation amongst us that was (un)fortunate enough to have the Farelly brothers' Dumb and Dumber as a part of our growing up - a film that most of us remember as an audacious, politically incorrect hoot. And yes, some of us have actually spent a lot of time wondering, between Jim Carrey's Lloyd and Jeff Daniels' Harry, who is 'dumb' and who is 'dumber'.That generation probably is also the only target audience for the sequel that has come 20 years later. Harry and Lloyd are also 20 years older, and they seem much dumber, though no less adorable. Unfortunately, the generation that's around the same age as I was when the first film came out is also significantly smarter and so much more worldy wise than we who first saw and loved Harry and Lloyd. That could be one key reason why Dumb and Dumber To will not make the splash the earlier film did.Make no mistake, the sequel is as audacious and politically incorrect as the first film. It's just that the humour has gotten old - and I'm talking about stuff like a cat that farts bird feathers. No one is spared - old people, young women, animals, Canada - everyone is fair game for Harry and Lloyd. The duo are off on a journey to find Harry's daughter, who was given away for adoption as a child. Finding her is not easy at all, particularly because Harry and Lloyd have to deal with, well, themselves. There is just one reason to watch Dumb and Dumber To - or two reasons, actually - Carrey and Daniels. Both look much older now, but admirably, neither of them seems low on energy. They're always up there, giving every gag their all, even though there are only a handful of genuinely funny moments in the film, and most of these involve unusually clever writing and/or pop culture references. Breaking Bad fans, for instance, will surely cheer the brief scene that shows Harry's new roommate.The writing for the most part though, is puerile. There are times when the loose writing leads to scenes where a lot of noise is made on screen, but not a soul in the audience laughs. As I mentioned earlier, some of the humour is so obviously dated, that it doesn't even get points for trying.Some of the humour in the film is also genuinely offensive - so much that you'd need a hugely open mind to not get offended or disgusted. A lot of it is also sexual in nature, though the laughs derive from the fact that Harry and Lloyd are usually the last to figure it out.What's still great to see, however, is Harry and Lloyd's friendship. Dubious for the most, where you don't really know if they're actually friends or they're just too dumb to know any better, this was also a hallmark of the earlier film - the fact that when it comes to it, the pair will stand by each other and go to the moon to help the other. It's naive and silly, but also a little sweet. There's solace in the fact that fondness, affection and love can transcend not just space and time, but IQ as well.But that's me being kind to characters that I'd always find it tough to be mean to. Dumb and Dumber To, propelled by two fine actors who let themselves go completely, is loud and sporadically funny. It works well for the sake of nostalgia, and may also make for a fun watch in a large group. Expecting anything more is akin to auditioning for a lead role in the film. ]"
50,"[Just in case the title of the movie doesn't arouse your skepticism about the quality of humor in the movie, the promos must have. No? Then rest assured the opening sequence will put your eternal optimism to rest. What with a bikini clad woman walking on to the shore of a beach. And Om Puri monkeying around in a black and red magician suit-meets-superhero costume is the final signature. Believe me, you cannot imagine how it hurts to use Om Puri and monkeying together in the same sentence. I must admit that the basic concept of letting the elderly have a life of their own and caring for them is very sweet. But, somehow the crassness with which it is done, did not gel with me. A son (Akshaye Khanna) yelling at his father (Paresh Rawal), in the name of comedy can work once or twice, but throughout? Not happening. Also, a father dreaming of his son finding love is only natural. Call me conservative, but him imagining the possible daughter-in-law (Genelia D'Souza) getting wet under a waterfall and getting all suggestive for his son is just not cool. Add to that a shirtless Om Puri being shrieked at by shrill Archana Puran Singh. How can we be expected to laugh at any of this?So yeah, Paresh Rawal, like always, tries to bring life to the trying-so-hard-to-make-you-laugh lines with his comic timing. This time is no better or no worse than others. Akshaye Khanna is screaming intolerably at the top of his voice half the time, which is like 75 minutes. And is it only me who thinks his dialogue delivery is going from bad to worse with each movie? He actually had extra pauses where none were warranted at a couple of places. Genelia looks pretty and plays her casual character alright. Whether she's acting or just the way she is in real life, we'll know only after she is 3-4 movies old. The lyrics and music of the songs are as generic as could be. Also the choreographer had the lead pair finish their gym/aerobic workout on set. And use of bikini-clad women for no particular reason has never been so blatant. So, cutting the songs out could only have helped the movie. Same goes for about another 15-20 minutes of the movie. There are unnecessary pauses and long dialogues which do nothing but elongate the runtime. What was the point of having the entire crew go to Kerala when neither did the script need Kerala, nor did they manage to capture her intrinsic beauty. I still think that humor is a nice way to portray a father-son relationship. But, I just don't understand why it has to be loud, long and lousy.]"
51,"[What is that one thing all historic,Indian patriotic films have in common? Oh yes, you guessed it right. Freedom fighters holding firelights in their hands and belting some heavily-worded, inspiring songs. I always wonder why the British captured freedom fighters while they were in hiding and never while they were singing openly. But that is how things are portrayed in our films. Being a patriotic tale, I was expecting all this mindless drama in Vitti Dandu. The film didn't surprise me, barring its basic storyline.Revolved around vitti dandu - a rural game, the film is a fictional incident that took place just six days before the nation got independence. But at its core lies a heartwarming relationship between a grandfather (Dilip Prabhavalkar) and his grandson, who is now narrating that story to his own grandson. As he takes a stroll down memory lane, the tone of his voiceover changes abruptly. His narrative shows you other characters recounting their own memories; as if being a firsthand witness to every happening. This whole affair makes you wonder if the character is genuinely reciting the tale or director Ganesh Kadam is forcibly showing it.Vitti Dandu is an absolutely refreshing story on paper. But it turns out to be an exaggerated one on screen. A conventionally-written screenplay and over-the-top direction fail to match the sincerity of the story. Kadam rather tries to depict it in the same fashion as many other films of its genre, eventually affecting performances of some brilliant actors. Except a few sequences, Prabhavalkar performs at his usual best. Rest of the cast is passable. They seem to be driven by their characters, but end up doing unnatural theatrics.The film's cinematography sorely misses the point. A simple treatment could've helped set the tone of 1947. Production design, too, fails to distinctively create that era. Editing doesn't help the film either, making an already lackluster narrative even more vulnerable. Contemporary sounds effects and lip-syncing songs are totally out-of-place. Instead of intensifying your experience, they just add to the boredom.Indian films are no match to Hollywood in visual effects (doesn't mean we're superior in other departments). They are, in fact, wonderful examples of disastrous VFX. This is despite the fact that major Hollywood productions are outsourced to Indian VFX studios. Considering its budget; I don't want to delve into Vitti Dandu's visual effects quality, but the choice of it. The director's preference to obviously fake appearances for the jeep-driving sequence is definitely startling.The climax sequence is one of my favorite terrible moments in the film. It somehow reminds me of those mindless, south Indian action potboilers. I literally couldn't stop myself from laughing. This is something unique that makes Vitti Dandu outshine other Indian patriotic films. An achievement in itself, isn't it?]"
52,"[The name Lucy might conjure black-and-white images of bubbly naivete for some, but any lingering subconscious connections you might have made to a popular 50s American sitcom disappear quite quickly, once Luc Besson's latest film begins.A spunky Scarlett Johansson in the title role almost immediately gets drawn into a violent series of events that lead to her being involuntarily administered a synthetic drug; except, the drug has an effect that one couldn't have ever imagined.The film has an interesting premise - the fact that the human mind is known to utilize only 10% of its capacity. What would happen if, somehow, it was able to optimize and use every bit of it? The result - the film would have you believe - is mind-boggling.There's no denying that the pace of the film - always brisk - and Johansson's performance, keep you interested at all times. Things often get out of hand in terms of believability, and some of the VFX in the film are unacceptably tacky. Yet, it is that intriguing premise that holds the film together. As Lucy begins to use more and more of her mind capacity, you're always curious about just where all of it will lead.Interestingly, Besson, who has also written and edited the film, clearly wants you to use more and more of your mind as the film progresses, just the way Lucy does. In the initial scenes, he cuts away to wildlife shots in the middle of the scene - to almost spoonfeed the audience about what exactly is going on. As the film makes its way to the business end, the explanatory cutaways cease, and the pace of cutting increases rapidly, making you concentrate harder. Along the way, the film poses some truly interesting questions about human perception and our understanding of existence itself. It attempts to put forth a theory about humanity's existential crisis. Yet, the film never quite rises over being just pulpy sci-fi. There are thrills to be had along the way, particularly in one deft car chase scene, (supposedly) through the streets of Paris. Johansson is terrific, which goes without saying. Not just because of her screen presence, but because she tempers her performance with subtle shifts that progress through the film. Morgan Freeman plays an elderly scientist and the only one who can understand what Lucy is going through - which basically means he plays Morgan Freeman. Lucy is fun while it lasts, and if you choose to take the philosophical questions that it poses back home with you, then you could spend some time tossing and turning them over in your head, to draw your own conclusions. But somehow, it never quite seems like that was Luc Besson's intention with this film.]"
53,"[I am spooked easily and maybe that is why I am not too fond of horror films. So, it is very difficult for me to understand what ""liking"" a horror film would feel like or what a ""good"" horror film is. In my mind then, I translate my feeling for a horror film to be good if it manages to spook me more than what is normal for me. With that disclaimer at your disposal, 3 AM is a decent horror film till it loses steam in the last half hour, that is.Its time for another disclaimer. When I say I get spooked easily, it doesn't mean a regular Hindi horror film that is actually a comedy masquerading around as a horror film. It is when the characters get me involved enough to care for them; when I don't want the ghost or the spirit to trouble them. And this bit 3 AM manages reasonably well by building the chemistry between Sunny (Rannvijay Singh) and Sara (Anindita Nayar) and the camaraderie between Sunny and his friends Cyrus (Salil Acharya) and Raj (Kavin Dave). Of course, for this first you have to get past some major loopholes in the character development like why would Sunny get Sara or even Cyrus and Raj into dangerous situations without any backup. But, once you are willing to accept that and move on, there are a few chilling moments and some eerily long, uncomfortable sequences in the dark.The kind of lingering sequences which make you want it to be dawn at 3AM or the characters to break into a dance number in the middle of the haunted building. The exact kind of thing I would scoff at, if it were to happen. And it does happen, and there is relief. Except that the relief stays too long and the tension fails to build back to the same level. The rest of the story is pretty much your average horror film story. Haunted building, evil spirit, innocent killed, search for truth by the survivors, impending disaster. The only thing to keep you going is the way the spookiness is executed. It boils down to the sound, light and the performances. Editing in and out of monochrome handycam recording and in general a dark environment gives 3 AM's horror bits a good eerie backdrop. Add on, the minimal use of background music and heavy reliance on sounds to set the chill at the right level. The mere absence of typical Hindi horror films violins and creaks is good enough to make any horror film reasonably scary. The performances aren't half bad either. The characters make the usual horrified faces and scream and display pain appropriately. None of it too distracting. Rannvijay Singh, Salil Acharya and Kavin Dave all give engaging performances in the horror scenes. The rest of the film though, they all look a little too affected. Anindita Nayar is the regular horror expression-less, supposed x-factor lead lady of the film. She doesn't have too big a role and isn't required to emote much.3 AM, thus, had all the ingredients needed to execute an average horror product. Where it fails is in keeping the momentum up through to the end. Even if it had lost its enthusiasm in the climax, it could've been overlooked. But, the energy drops a good half hour before the end, as if it became too intense for the makers themselves. Even though 3 AM leaves room for a sequel with a very interesting premise, this one is a little bit of an anti-climax, a little bit of a cop-out, a lot of a mood-dampner. So what, if I am not complaining?]"
54,"[A contract killer who has his first fist fight when he was 5 is reformed because of love while the reformer, the lady, is oblivious to the fact that he kill for a living. Add songs at random spots, loud background score,   louder dialogue delivery and you have a film that disappoints you with every passing frame. Kill Dil doesn't start out like that though. The opening scenes are actually perfectly quirky with slick cinematography and crisp editing. It makes you sit up and take in all that is happening on screen. Until, Govinda enters, which is about 5-7 minutes into the film. I'm not saying it is because of Govinda's entry that things go downhill, it is a coincidence that the moment the trio Govinda-Ranveer Singh-Ali Zafar start singing one of the title songs, that you wonder how come this sudden drop to slapstick zone? After that, for quite some time, I tried to make sense of the absolute lameness of how the story was moving until I caught myself trying too hard to like the film owing to the first five minutes.Every once in a while, there is an odd dialogue that brings a smile. Ranveer Singh's overt attempt at being cute, charms intermittently too. But, the overall plot, zero attempt at building any intrigue, the unremarkable characters topped off with outlandish songs popping in from nowhere, just kills any attempt by the audience to enjoy the film. For instance, Parineeti Chopra's character, Disha just exists. She has zero role to play in how the others are behaving but all the credit and discredit goes to Disha. Similarly, Tutu (Ali Zafar) is the protagonist, Dev's (Ranveer Singh) best friend, his alter ego too, but Tutu comes across as just incidental. Dev himself and more so his transformation seems arbitrary. Everything he does comes across as something a character in his situation in any film, ought to have done. His actions seem rather functional.Fortunately, the performances keep things at the borderline of tolerable. Govinda instills fear as he is supposed to but by the end goes over-the-top and the drama gets over-bearing. Ali Zafar is the most subdued of the lot. While it is refreshing to watch him in a non-chocolate-boy kind-of a role, facial hair taking it a long way, his performance very soon boils down to the same old expressions. Ranveer Singh, like I said, charms but the character is too loosely written for him to do much with it. The biggest waste of talent here is Parineeti Chopra. Not only because this is a role she must have sleep-walked through but also because her character is just inconsequential.You are left then with just a few one-liners strewn across that have the potential to bring a smile. Some stylish cinematography and background music in the first few minutes that resort to tacky and loud respectively by the end of the film. And the end itself of the film is pretty lame. Story lines like Kill Dil had started losing their charm 30+ years ago. I am still not able to get over the fact that Shaad Ali and team, couldn't add one new angle to make it look like a product for and by the next generation. ]"
55,"[Paresh Mokashi's first film Harishchandrachi Factory depicted Dadasaheb Phalke's struggle to make India's first motion picture, Raja Harishchandra. It was a fascinating story presented in a disappointing manner. His second venture - Elizabeth Ekadashi, portrays a family's struggle to overcome mounting financial woes. Their efforts to survive and lead a normal life could've made a more engaging, heartwarming film. Instead, the director presents you a plot that is predictable at every juncture.The film is about a family that gets into an unexpected financial problem. A widowed mother, the sole breadwinner of the family, strives hard to get themselves out of this dilemma. Her kids, however, decide to take matters in their own hands and support their mother. We all know the story and what will happen next and thereafter. Yet, you will be surprised to see how beautifully Madhugandha Kulkarni's story is woven around Elizabeth - a cycle, and Ashadhi Ekadashi (an auspicious day). That's why, no matter how conventional the narrative is, I don't worry about it as long as the treatment is heeded to.Now, this cycle called Elizabeth was gifted to Dnyanesh (a lead character) by his late father. As does every human being, this family and above all Dnyanesh finds an emotional bond with it. Mokashi captures this affection so wonderfully that you'll yearn for more. Alas, his weakest directional side spoils the whole show. Over-explanatory dialogues and over-exaggerated performances were the biggest bummer for Harishchandrachi Factory. And you get to see that imprint in Elizabeth Ekadashi as well. It's really hard to understand why Indian filmmakers question our sensibilities rather than challenging them. Why can't they let us feel the story rather than describing it to us through dialogue?Mokashi once again failed to take advantage of his talented, charming cast. Their unnecessarily staged, not-so-natural performances make you think if the director really wanted it that way for this film or he prefers it this way by default. The characters' struggle is evident throughout the film. You feel nothing about them though. As a result, you don't desperately want the protagonist to succeed in his endeavors. Because somewhere you know he might win anyway. Mokashi tries to throw in a few surprises, but he is very late. His predictable screenplay has already done the job.At 90 minutes, it might look like the film is short and crisp. But a sharper edit could've surely helped to disguise its glitches. Mokashi had an opportunity to show a cinematic climax that would've left audiences speechless. It's a shame that he chose an absolutely passe one. Above all, it is so casually directed that it makes me wonder if he was the same guy whose last film was India's official entry to Academy Awards.Amol Gole's cinematography isn't ground-breaking, but it is not something I've seen in Marathi films in recent times. Each scene is lit so brilliantly that it adds to the intensity of the narrative. Very well done!This story could've actually taken place anywhere, but the director knows its soul very well. No wonder the production set in the backdrop of Pandharpur looks so authentic. The visual beauty of Elizabeth Ekadashi is such that you may not mind overlooking its shortcomings.]"
56,"[Did the whole world change while I was on vacation? Or maybe I am just naive. When did the singular motto of every married person become to try and have an extra-marital affair? And even if that happened, do we really need to blame a city for our promiscuity? However, once you get past these two basic plot premises, you begin to appreciate the performances and the flashes of clever dialogue. The most remarkable achievement of the director and the actors is the chemistry between each couple, whichever part of the triangle they are. Be it - revulsion, indifference, love, intimacy - all emotions convey (at most times) what the character feels. Also, the characters are pretty consistent, which is an achievement in itself. And Irrfan Khan and Konkona Sen Sharma playing comic relief is so refreshing! They keep the mood light whenever the other characters start taking themselves too seriously, giving the required impetus whenever the pace begins to slacken. Shilpa Shetty gives an elegant performance and Kay Kay Menon plays to perfection the-guy-you-would-love-to-hate. And we are back to a suicidal Kangna Ranaut, but at least this time around, she looks good. Sharman Joshi's talent desperately needs to be treated with meatier roles. And somehow, the Dharmendra-Nafisa Ali track seemed very forced and contrived, especially because of the shabby treatment their dialogues were given.The movie starts off with some brilliant lines that almost sound like poetry, but soon enough doze off to inane-land. Thereafter, the brilliance is pretty much sporadic. Similarly, the lyrics are a welcome change from the nonsense we have been served in the name of poetry, of late. They reflect the mood of the characters and flow well with the overall situations. However, all the songs sound like they have been composed by a rock band. Which would have been tolerable but for the picturization. In an attempt to avoid lip-synching they went overboard. Give me the unnecessary songs, with barely-clad men and women dancing for me, I will take that. But, three men - none of whom have seen a comb or a razor in the past year, but know a lot about greasing curly locks - coming at me like objects do in a 3-D show, in every single song. Not done! Even in the name of fashion.It is the climax of movies that do not have any particular purpose in mind that can make or break the movie. And the culmination fails here big time. It feels like the writer got bored towards the end and just wanted to get it done with one way or the other. If not for the cumbersome climax, the movie might have been well worth a watch. But, alas...]"
57,"[Update: I watched the film again in IMAX and thought I should share my experience. *  * *Chris Nolan shot a few scenes of The Dark Knight and nearly 45 minutes of The Dark Knight Rises in the IMAX format. In Interstellar, he went a step further, with a substantial chunk of the movie being shot in the large film format that Nolan is so fond of. There's a reason for it - true IMAX, with its incredible screen size, great sound and the film projection system (not digital like the IMAX screens in other cities of India), is easily the most immersive film viewing format currently. Some shots of Interstellar, particular the space exploration parts, look absolutely stunning in IMAX. To experience all of them one after the other is humbling. Then again, with the large format, it seems some of the flaws of the film get equally amplified. Still, IMAX is definitely the format to watch the film in, even though such a small percentage of us actually have access to it. *  * *Humankind may have evolved into a greedy, complex species that is devouring our planet, with only vestiges of the once-inexhaustable thirst for knowledge that set us apart from our co-inhabitants on earth. Yet, perhaps that is the single greatest gift that we've received - curiousity, the urge to know, the tendency to seek an answer to every question we come across. We're travellers and explorers. Our journeys may be literal or figurative, (the quest to solve Fermat's Last Theorem, for instance, was also a journey,) but our inherent goal has always been just one - to go further and further into the depths of the unknown. That's all that has truly excited the human race, not routines and the mundane, decadent lifestyles we see today.Christopher Nolan's Interstellaris a journey. Not only does he take us on an unfathomable ride along with his protagonist Cooper, but he also makes us journey inwards, to seek what we don't yet know about ourselves. Yes, a crash course in physics would go a long way in making the film easier to follow, but the emotions at the heart of the film are primal. They may or may not find their way into that spot in your heart that will make them resonate with you, but that's besides the point. The question, ultimately, is about Nolan's intent.Interstellaris far richer in emotions than Nolan's previous work - so much so that the emotional core is one of the cornerstones of the film. How much the emotions touch you is a big measure of how much you're willing to move past the vagaries and ostensible foibles of the film - which appear to be many.Set in the distant future, where Earth seems incapable of being a viable home for humanity for much longer, NASA recruits a former astronaut to lead a mission into space, to find an alternate home to ensure the continued survival of our species. The problems of space and time - the biggest hurdles in accessing the outer reaches of our universe - are solved by a curious wormhole.  Nolan doesn't thrust the science upon us right away. We begin by observing the state of the world, through the eyes of Cooper and his family. We see the relationship he has with his children - particularly with his daughter. Nolan, like most filmmakers, uses his characters to voice his own thoughts often, so it's interesting to see Cooper encourage his children to also question and analyze. The space travel and exploration aspects, though obviously forming the bulk of the film, begin much later. It is here that some knowledge of the physics that the film references would be of immense use in following the events that occur. Relativity, wormholes, black holes, gravity, the works - for those whom all of this is alien and incomprehensible, the film will only be a plodding, indulgent mystery. The deeper the understanding of the physics in question, the more gripping the film becomes.Through it all, the overarching presence of love never leaves. Love, it seems, transcends both space and time, almost holding the cosmos together. Nolan isn't particularly adept at filming drama, so the film's weakest moments are when characters stop to talk about love or to express it. The scenes are earnest, but a tad bit awkward. The film's most jaw-dropping moments are bang in the midst of the space exploration, where some of Hoyte van Hoytema's magnificent frames are a spectacle to behold. Chris Nolan's most well-known trope - his penchant for the non-linear narrative - once again forms the backbone of the film. Except, this time because he's playing with dimensions higher than those to which our earthly presences are bound, there is likely to be more than the usual amount of confusion about exactly what happened and when. The film warrants repeat viewings, quite like every other film in his filmography.Hans Zimmer always seems to set aside something special for Chris Nolan, and this time is no different. The music score of Interstellaris a hypnotic masterwork - what it lacks in variation, it makes up for in sheer ambition. In fact, the sound design of the film overall plays a huge role in gnawing at your attention. The use of silence in space, particularly in the face of the rapturous visual grandeur on display, is humbling.The film's biggest weakness is its runtime. At nearly 3 hours, it can be a test of patience for those who switch off at melodrama or science. However, for those who don't have a problem with either, every minute of the film is a treat, because there's always something happening. Everything is connected, everything has meaning, nothing is there just because of a whim of a sagacious filmmaker.Interstellarwas shot in the IMAX format, which is quite different in size and aspect ratio to the regular 35mm Cinemascope that we're used to. So obviously, the film is best watched in the largest screen one can find (the IMAX screen in Hyderabad for instance; the only true IMAX in the country). But the scale of the visuals is trumped by the scale of Chris Nolan's vision, so Interstellarwill make for an out-of-the-ordinary phenomenon on any screen. Some of humanity's greatest achievements have been finding the answers to questions that confounded generations, and these answers came as a reward after many moons of toil. Patience, it seems, is always rewarding. Interstellaris quite like that. As it twists around time, space and everything in between, it rewards you for patience, attention and curiosity. It also serves a measure of these for each individual, because like all of cinema, Interstellarisn't for everyone.]"
58,"[Rang Rasiya is bold. Not just because of the one scene with sex and nudity, but also because of the theme(s) it picks on and the narrative they've chosen to depict the concepts. For that itself, Rang Rasiya could be watched by an avid film buff. However, beyond that, it comes across as a mish-mash of themes, all trying to have their say and none getting enough space to do it. Randeep Hooda as a misunderstood, controversial painter is a strong lead. I have come to love his choice of films and his growing strength as a performer. Sure, he still comes across as repetitive across films with his brooding characters. But, Rang Rasiya gives him a little more width for expression and he thrives. Nandana Sen is gorgeous and gives her character the fullest too. For once, the lead lady character in a Hindi film is used for her body, and yet it doesn't look sleazy or doesn't seem like objectification. The credit for that of course goes to the writing and the story. Unfortunately though, the chemistry between the two leads seems forced. The intimate scenes though much more explicit and thus seemingly more natural also come across as self-conscious. In fact, that can be said about the film as a whole.The makers are very aware that they are trying something different, and while it is not pretentious of self-consumed, the awareness shows. This doesn't let me get involved as an audience. Also, the narrative is too episodic thus not allowing a smooth flow from one scenario into another. That fluidity is of utmost importance to a film that attempts to be so poetic. And this film, for its subject matter deserves to be poetic too. For one, it is set in a period more than 100 years ago. That era lends itself to romanticization on its own, which wasn't capitalised on completely. To top it off, you have a painter who wishes to express things that the world around him is not ready for. What more could lend itself to lyricism in a film?Also, this alone was good enough to make for a full length feature film. However, issues related to gender roles, freedom, value of art and the creator, philanthropy, religion and more are brought into the realm creating a potpourri that doesn't blend well together. Not to mention, each thread feels like it is left midway. I am all for open-ended stories, but this seemed a unintentional. I would still watch Rang Rasiya, for what it's trying to do. The hope is that as there are more and more bold themes, these creases will be ironed out to give us a wholesome, less self-aware film. Till then, this is a decent enough start. ]"
59,"[Sure, I knew what the movie is going to be about. Not being a huge fan of Basu Chatterjee's film either, didn't help. But, that The Shaukeens would have no redeeming factor whatsoever, was disappointing. I don't consider myself a prude or conservative, but watching the likes of Anupam Kher, Annu Kapoor and Piyush Mishra as lechers isn't my idea of fun. It doesn't help that Lisa Haydon seems to be playing dumb, but looks too smart to be playing so dumb. That's not to say, that they don't act well. At least the men. They do their jobs well enough to creep out any woman in their vicinity - both on screen and in the audience.I don't really have much more to say about this one except that I had to keep comparisons with my all-time worst film ever, *Buddha Mar Gaya * at bay. And it wasn't the easiest task to do that. ]"
60,"[Gillian Flynn's novel Gone Girl is a terrific piece of pop-lit; a racy thriller that forms the setting for some audacious characters and great insights into people and relationships. Although narrated completely in first person, it always had the trappings of a film in it - a film that would truly take some making.Some of David Fincher's most popular films were adapted from novels, and he has a penchant for making films that outshone their books. The expectations for Gone Girl, naturally, were through the roof. What we get is a mixed bag - while the film is a neat little thriller when viewed as a standalone entity, it does rob you of many, many gob smacking moments that the book offers you.A man comes home one day to discover that his wife is missing. Naturally, the needle of suspicion is on him. As he battles the cops and public perception to prove his innocence, we slowly see the story of the couple unravel.Gone Girl draws you in from go. Hope seems sucked out right from the first frame of the film, as Nick Dunne goes on to lose his wife. Ben Affleck suits the character beautifully; we alternate between his outer personality - a product of his upbringing - and his inner despair, as things begin to go south for him rather quickly. Then, there's Amy, who we get to know early on through her diary entries. Rosamund Pike looks a lot like one would expect her to look. But somewhere, it seems like the essence of her character is lost. We get to see what Amy does, but we hardly get to know what she feels. In fact, what seems to be sorely lacking from the film is a deeper understanding into the relationship between Nick and Amy. What made their fairytale romance so special, and then what went wrong? The answer, of course, lies in the two characters, but it's a pity that we hardly ever get to see them together on screen. Any relationship goes through the test of time, and to truly justify why Amy disappeared, it would have worked infinitely better for the film if we got to see more of what made Nick and Amy tick, and what didn't. There are David Fincher's deft little touches, though, which add beautiful little layers to the film - watch out, for instance, for the accessories that embellish Amy's pencils while writing her diary at various points. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's dissonant music score is another facet that aids the film's overall sense of unease and discomfort. Here in India, the censor board has ensured that the film is that wee bit more annoying to watch, because of a strange pan-and-zoom method that has been used to mask some of the violent or sexually explicit content - essentially, the image blows up and shifts to the least offensive part of the frame in an awkward manner, ruining much of the experience.Gone Girl still makes for a gripping watch - for the mysteriously unfolding tale, for the cast that largely suits the characters, and for some genuine insight into the complexities of human thought. However, for a truly enriching experience, I strongly suggest you read the book before watching the film. ]"
61,"[After the lead pair, two crooks, brought in together in a police van for crimes they committed separately, predictably and lamely falls in love, Tamanchey is like any other love story with a couple that faces the wrath of their families for being in love. Only the family is replaced by the lady's boyfriend who happens to be a wrathful and powerful goon himself. For this group of criminals, you are allowed the liberty of fowl language, also making the film a little different from your regular family drama. But there is just no other element in the film to get you interested, let alone keep you there. It is kind of nice that a love story was made without any mush but that you don't even sense the chemistry between the couple is a let-down. This is despite lots and lots of screen time with each other and plenty more than one intimate scene between the two. The writing, in every aspect - dialogue, characterization, story arc - is completely lackluster. And that's where the crux lies. When pretty much the whole plot is predictable you can have only so much interest in how the actual ending goes. When the characters have a flat arch it matters little that they carry a shade of grey. When the focus is making the film overtly typical of how a real life criminal would talk, the superficiality and in-your-face nature of the dialogue shines through more than the lines itself. There is very little then that Richa Chadda and Nikhil Dwivedi can do with their performances. They have the right expressions but they all seem too mechanical. Either like they are under some kind of stress or like they don't have their heart in it. Just one of those cases where the hard work shows instead of seeming effortless. Given the ""different"" setting for the love story Tamanchey could have had a spark that could've made it at least a film watching once, if not a good film. That as you know by now, didn't quite work out. ]"
62,"[Sonali Cable surprisingly begins to engage you the common man being stuck in the deep nexus between politicians and businessmen. You've seen the nexus earlier, and you know the stuck common man all too well. Yet, the story unfolds showing every seemingly powerful person having someone more powerful than them call the shots and hooks you in. Unfortunately, it finds itself in a rut for a bit and then crumbles and resolves itself all too suddenly.Sonali Cable picks an issue that seems to be close to the makers' hearts. With a slight left of center inclination, it tries to plead its case of the injustice faced by small business owners who are stubbed out by macho businesses with clout and resources. For a bit, you might wonder if it is contradicting itself by showing the humble beginnings of the big business owner and the small business owner dreaming big. But it tries to sneak in a meek ""it's the how that is wrong, not the what.""Yet, most of Sonali Cable could've worked had it raised the tempo to a hilt in the climax with something more than an unimaginative end to the proceedings. It built up pretty well and it is a shame that the finish felt rushed and a make-do arrangement. Fortunately, the characters are engaging and some of the lines are interesting. It is refreshing to see the lady take a lead in a film of this budget and nature. At times Sonali's character even is completely independent of whether or not she has her boyfriend, Raghu's support. She carried a ""good to have, but don't need"" kind of an attitude towards him - not something you easily find in Hindi films.Sonali is played by Rhea Chakraborty who looks so much like Genelia D'Souza. Once I got past that I realised that the least you can say about Rhea Chakraborty is that she is earnest. You can tell she's trying hard, yet within a film or two, given the right role, she could very easily wow you. You sense her character, Sonali's chemistry with Ali Fazal's character, Raghu in the scenes where they start getting intimate. Raghu is a support to Sonali and Ali Fazal plays it out with the constraint that a supporting actor should play his part with.Anupam Kher's Waghela on the other hand, sticks to your memory, as an annoying over-the-top rags-to-riches story that you'd rather forget. But that is what the character is meant to do. Smita Jaykar too leaves behind a strong performance. Interestingly, the rest of departments of film-making, except maybe the lyrics of the songs, are so unspectacular that they draw your attention to the fact that the focus is the issue at hand. Sonali Cable wanted to make a point and it has tried its best to not lose focus. Unfortunately, though, it feels a little long drawn out with a tame ending. Yet, there are some bits that stay with you, bit that you can watch the whole film for once. ]"
63,"[For starters, let's set aside the fact that Kaushik Ghatak's Samrat &amp; Co is a recreation of a Sherlock Holmes-esque character, in India - an absolute travesty of a recreation at that. No, first let's talk about the film as an independent cinematic work, a murder mystery thrust into the hands of a super detective.Mumbai-based celebrity detective, the eponymous Samrat, receives a strange case from a pretty young lady, a case that prompts him to travel with her to Shimla. Ultimately, a series of murders unfold, as Samrat races against time to connect the clues strewn across his path and solve the case.Unfortunately, what we're served through this plot (that's anyway older than the hills the film is set in,) is a succession of rather juvenile 'mysterious' circumstances and events which shouldn't challenge a schoolboy, much less a supposed ace detective who can accurately guess a person's life history within minutes of meeting them.Predictably laden with red herrings galore, the film tries too hard to be clever, but falls flat because the writers either underestimated the audience, or over-estimated themselves. Big work is made of silly substitution cipher codes and clues as simple as A-B-C.The tangled mess of a screenplay was bad enough, but what makes matters worse is that most of the film is shot against a chroma background, with computer-generated scenery added later. It gives the film an fake look throughout; a pity because setting the film in the hills gave the film a chance to be a visual treat, a chance that was squandered by the filmmakers. Now let's get to the film's real crime - the attempted murder of Messrs Holmes and Watson. A mockery is made of these iconic literary characters, as their Indian counterparts Samrat and Chakradhar resort to showboating, buffoonery and general incompetence, while relegating common sense and propriety to some forgotten corner. Rajeev Khandelwal, a fair performer otherwise, really overdoes the Sherlock, while the less said about the guy who plays Watson, the better. The supporting cast of the film is essentially an assortment of people over-acting and under-acting.In an attempt to draw at least something positive from the film, one can say that it least it never drops its pace and might even keep you interested in its silliness at all times - you wonder how much harder will the makers of the film try. Hopefully, Samrat &amp; Co will die a death with the film, and future filmmakers will think long and hard before creating such lightweight caricatures of characters who have enthralled so many generations.]"
64,"[Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover. Pappu Can't Dance Saala offers not an ounce more than what you would expect after you saw the trailer. The problem is that you expect boredom after watching the trailer.The story is good ol' boy-meets-girl with a dash of city-village divide and a topping of opposites-attract. There is no humor, no spark, no emotional involvement because of the dreary situations and the monotonous dialogue given to fill in the details. There's only so much that a brilliant actor like Vinay Pathak can do. Even though this time instead of the happy-go-luck simpleton, he plays the angry-irritable simpleton, it feels stale. I refuse to blame the actor just yet, the film is not fresh in its take or its treatment. Neha Dhupia annoys as desired by the character in the beginning but that too quickly begins to fall flat once you see a her absolutely uncivil, inconsiderate character grow a heart. Again, can't blame the actor. Though casting her as a dancing superstar and moreso Rajat Kapoor as a choreographer is laughable. Rajat Kapoor who doesn't move as much as a finger in the name of dance through the film. I mean, thank goodness for some mercies and all that, but why cast him at all? Don't tell me there aren't enough people in the Saurabh Shukla-Vinay Pathak-Rajat Kapoor camp who couldn't have danced to prove why the character was so reveled. There are a couple of moments in the film between Vinay Pathak and Neha Dhupia that are endearing, but that's too little to make a film a worthwhile watch. There is also an attempt to draw a balance between antagonist and misinformed attitudes between cities and small towns. But the first problem there is that in order to bridge the gap, the differences are shown in the same old stereotypical ways. By the time you see the modern views warming up to traditional ones and the traditional ones reciprocate, its too late. The second problem it's all too preachy.Similarly, the effort taken to enlighten men to menstrual cycle woes is sweet and all but it's too in-the-face. It reminded me of the contraception ads in the 80s where one friend would explain the concept to another. This was one way to handle it and it didn't work, next time maybe we can try using sensitivity in order to sensitize.I liked the attempt in the beginning to call off the ways in which a woman uses her fairer-gender card to her advantage. Using a man who sees through it and wants to treat a woman as his equal and thus won't allow her to gain out of it, went very well with how the character develops later. Only such a man could see, appreciate and accept a woman for what she is instead of just see her as either weak or as a converse characterless. So many meaningful points to make and yet no cigar. Such is the sad story of Pappu and his inability to dance. ]"
65,"[Happy New Year is a ""buy one get two free"" film. You were promised a heist, you get that and a revenge drama and underdog film for free. And imagine a Hindi film with three story films and none of them pressing too hard on the romantic angle. And here I was worried that Happy New Year wouldn't have a story a la Tees Maar Khan.  But hey, I'd take that 3 predictable stories compared to none any day. It isn't surprising then that the film is 10 seconds short of three hours. Indeed, I was dreading the movie even before it started just by a look at its runtime. One would have thought movies of this length aren't made any more. And yet, the movie didn't feel that long. Though I don't know who takes the credit for that. Was the movie really engaging or has my patience and general mental readiness for movies belonging to brand Khan improved by a mile and more? For better or worse, as the case may be, the movie slackens only rarely. That didn't make the story any less predictable. Granted, the writers try hard to keep the suspense on, but given the genre of the film and the festive season you know where the film is headed even before you've seen the film. Sure, for every self-referencing, lame joke there is a tiny twist that you wouldn't expect from a Farah Khan film. For every random reference to one film or another there is a tongue-in-cheek remark about pop culture and current trends winking at you. For every time the sole lady in the film is put down by the other characters there is a little detail that catches your attention. Unfortunately, in each of the above cases, the annoying outweighs the surprising, leaving you in a state where you are good with the surprise but can't overcome the banality of the rest of the film. Happy New Year takes a shot at the ""realness"" of reality shows. It laughs at films of its own kind, as Farah Khan films usually do, but this time it wasn't wearing a ""we are like that only"" on its sleeve but had a more ""something needs to be fixed"" attitude. Hats off to Anurag Kashyap and Vishal Dadlani for their sporting spirit, as cheap and meh as their cameo came across as. Who would've thought there'd be a film in which Anurag Kashyap overacts more than Shah Rukh Khan even if it is very intentionally so. In fact, all the actors, as expected again, overact. But, it's not the cringe inducing overact. It's the kind that tries to shove the fact that its all a performance down your throat. The kind which tries to make every moment dramatic and impactful. Yet, each of the characters gets that one scene where you see a glimpse of what the actor is really capable of. Making it seem that it is powerful acting must be the easiest kind to do. Especially for the likes of Boman Irani and Abhishek Bachchan. Shah Rukh Khan comes across as even more narcissistic than usual (especially with the end credits). Sonu Sood is treated like a newbie who has gotten a chance to show off his six-pack, except that they cannot overdo Shah Rukh Khan's ten. The manner in which Deepika Padukone's character Mohini is put down and treated is the shabbiest of them all. That she doesn't leave insult after insult, to me came across as one of the things that the movie was trying to be satirical about. I am not sure, if I am giving the film a little more credit than is due though.  Even so, Deepika Padukone was the only one who really shone in the film. Trying to maintain dignity in the worst of circumstances. The same cannot be said about Abhishek Bachchan. I have now begun to feel bad for him as an actor - he has really reduced to levels where he is a side-flunkey and does whatever comes his way, though he is capable of a lot more. Yet, his comic timing, even with the worst of jokes get you cracking. In that sense, you cannot help but giggle at a lot of what's going on in the film. At times, it feels like you are watching Tom and Jerry. At other times there are innuendos, you'd rather not have in the film - because they are in bad taste, repetitive, not new and not funny. Even so, I am pleasantly surprised and happy that Happy New Year attempted story. Yes, most of it is expectedly lame and laughable. But, isn't it cool that Farah Khan thinks her audience to be worthy of it. As if nodding to the fact that the audiences tastes are changing, even if the nod is a weary one and the change is ever so slow.  Thank you, lady, and I mean it sincerely. This trend, makes me hope that there will be one Diwali, not to far away, that will make me look forward to a Shah Rukh Khan starrer, directed by Farah Khan. Come on Team Khans, you can do it!]"
66,"[A Muslim community bonds happily with a Hindu neighbourhood. Both live and die for each other. A Hindu boy enters the scene. This so-called, dashing hero bumps into a Muslim girl and immediately falls for her. He woos her tirelessly (as if he has nothing else to do). They sing, dance and eventually share passionate romance. And suddenly all hell breaks loose. We all know this story. Countless amount of Bollywood, romantic films (majorly of the 90s) have followed the path of success with a similar premise. Then, how can Pyaar Vali Love Story - a romantic story of the early 90s - be an exception to this overused, success-guaranteeing formula?Think of SRK-standard romance dramas, Rohit Shetty-styled action flicks, mindless songs and dances, over-the-top dialogues - combine these and the end result is Pyaar Vali Love Story. From producers to director (who previously directed dull, but widely successful Duniyadari), cast to technicians, everything about the film looks really promising. I've nothing against another Hindu-Muslim love story. All that really matters is its portrayal. Apparently what you get is a serious let-down.Set in the backdrop of 1992 Mumbai riots, Pyaar Vali Love Story recounts the romance of Aliya and Amar, and their struggle to stay together. Sai Tamhankar tries hard to appear as a Muslim girl, but in vain. In fact, every other Muslim character looks like they are trying too hard to look so, throughout the film. Right from the beginning, all they speak is the unconvincing mishmash of Hindi and Marathi words. Our filmmakers have continually failed to convincingly depict non-Marathi characters in Marathi films. This film is no different. It appears more and more unreal as the story progresses. Just by donning Muslim costumes or uttering Urdu words, you don't seem Muslim. There are many other factors that come into play. This is the failure of the writers, casting directors, production designers, costume guys as well as make-up department.Sanjay Jadhav's abilities are more questionable than anybody. The man in charge is himself to be blamed for going ahead with such an outlandish, lacklustre script. Had the plot been written thoughtfully, it could've still done wonders despite its inherent predictable nature.The film's lead actor, Swapnil Joshi is the biggest disappointment. I don't understand why this talented actor is trying to be the Shah Rukh Khan of Marathi cinema? Instead of exploring his acting, he has made himself busy playing chocolate hero. He is getting repetitive and tedious with every film. Urmila Kanetkar's Nandini is bold, yet annoying. Nevertheless, she is far more bearable in an otherwise mediocre film.In the film, Aliya fondly calls Amar 'stupid'. On a serious note, the word aptly suits the story. Insanely stupid to be more precise. This one is absolutely not worthy of your precious time and money.]"
67,"[We all love heroes. We sing to their tunes. We dance to their moves. We read about them tirelessly. And we even follow their films mindlessly. But what about an extraordinary hero, you might have never heard of or seen before? Will people throng theatres just to watch such an unusual hero on celluloid? Well, I found my answers when I saw audiences turning up in big numbers on the first day, first show of Samruddhi Porey's Dr. Prakash Baba Amate. The auditorium was buzzing with excitement. Though it died down very shortly.The film is the official biopic of Dr. Prakash Baba Amte - a man (played masterfully by Nana Patekar) who sacrificed his entire life for tribals and wild animals in the Hemalkasa area of Maharashtra. It traces the struggle of Amte and his wife Dr. Mandakini Amte (Sonali Kulkarni) with tribals, wild animals, naxalites and corrupt government officials. The film takes you back to an era where this man lived, worked and even performed emergency surgical procedures without electricity. The way he developed personal bond with tribals and wild animals is one of the most fascinating aspects of Amte's story. This tale is undoubtedly heroic. However, not this film. At least not the way it is narrated. I don't understand, why director, Porey had to overemphasise the protagonist's heroics in every single scene? Actually, this is the outcome of passe, lacklustre writing. Its screenplay is structured in the most typical manner. I know, flashbacks inside a flashback look bold. But only if they're handled carefully. Considering the subject, occasional slow-paced narrative is somewhat justified. But where is the drama that hooks you with its storytelling?Every department of this film seems haywire - writing-direction, cinematography, editing, sound design or even makeup. Mahesh Anye's Cinematography is beautiful, undoubtedly. But it fails to add any value to the storytelling. What's the use of capturing stunning shots, when they rarely tell you a story? That wow factor is missing throughout the film. The visuals and audios are sometimes poles apart. When you're dying to see the drama, you're bombarded with philosophy. But when you actually get to see it, you barely feel anything about it. You just see gore, but feel nothing for the characters or their situations. That is another letdown. The film's only saving grace is Nana Patekar and Sonali Kulkarni's acting prowess. Both the lead actors are back (after Taxi No. 9211 and Deool to charm you with their power-packed, sizzling chemistry. However, directing your talented, lead cast isn't a big deal. The real challenge is to bring good performances out of the extras (mostly tribals) as well. Nagraj Manjule's Fandry is a beautiful example to describe it. This is where Porey fails miserably.Average films turn better (of course, to some extent) thanks to smart editing. However; this film's amateurish, outdated editing adds to its woes. The film does have few sequences you can emotionally relate to. They are simply beautiful too. But the director's overall focus seems to be only on telling (sometimes showing) you almost everything that happened. This leaves you disheartened.""Dr. Prakash Baba Amte - The Real Hero"" isn't a terrible film in its entirety. The makers had a fascinating story to tell through two of the best actors our industry has. They definitely seem to have had a good intention (who wants to make a bad film anyway?) It's just that their approach went wrong. The sad part is that this is the official biopic of Amte. I doubt if this inspirational tale would ever be retold.]"
68,"[There is a fundamental problem with Annabelle. The eponymous doll that stares down at you from the posters of the film, (which, if you remember, made a small appearance in James Wan's excellent The Conjuring, is creepy as hell. There seems to be no logical reason why a sane person would, of their own will, keep such an ugly thing in their home, particularly when there's a baby on the way. I'm not talking supernatural, here. I'm just talking plain aesthetics.Either way, once you move past that little hitch, you really want to be wowed by a film like Annabelle. It has all the staples that go into an engaging horror film - a beautiful young couple, an adorable baby, and that excruciatingly hideous doll. But, a handful of moments apart, the film is rather bland.The problem lies mostly in the mild, tempered manner in which the characters and their woes have been written. Despite her classical good looks, the lead actress (whose name, curiously, is also Annabelle,) - the primary subject of the haunting - has a flat, one-note and predictable character. Same goes for her husband, an annoyingly supportive fellow who never seems to take a step that's against his wife's wishes. Now I don't encourage disobeying one's wife, but some amount of conflict in their relationship would have done the film a world of good. It would have put something at stake apart from the obvious.Instead, they are a sincere, god-fearing and hard-working pair that no one would ever wish to harm. They're so perfect that even at the most depressing points in the film, you feel quite sure that nothing bad can happen to them. The haunting of Annabelle, the doll is also written in a slipshod, unconvincing manner.The scares themselves are also mostly unimaginative. They seem to follow a checklist of sorts, making them almost always predictable from a mile away. In fact, this is usually my biggest grouse with horror films - the moments that are meant to scare you are very rarely organic, derived from the plot and setting. They rely more on startling the audience, than on building a sense of foreboding and that tingling of the nerves.Another aspect where this film misses out is on the sense of time and place. Annabelle is set before the events of The Conjuring, which itself was set in the late 60s. However, unlike the latter, which was so consumed in its period that it drew you in, Annabelle seems to hardly ever feel authentic and true to its period. It hurts the film at a subtle level.What you're left with, then, are conflict and resolution - both of which are rather tame, never once causing thrill. Seasoned cinematographer John R. Leonetti, who has shot a number of James Wan's films, is the director of Annabelle. While he certainly has considerable experience lighting and shooting horror, his direction is at best functional, never once seizing on the openings for genuine horror that the script provides him.Though, to be fair, at least a few moments in the film are crafted well enough to cause the more weak-bladdered members of the audience to soil their pants. For the most, however, Annabelle is just horror-lite. The film would work better as a primer for those who've never had the liver for horror, than for a toughened horror film fanatic. ]"
69,"[You have to grant that Bang Bang delivers what it promises in the trailers. Lots of action, just about tolerable stunts, a bit of coochie-coo between the incredibly good-looking lead pair and lots of on-screen time for the two, individually and together - all of it pretty much mindless, with no attempt at creating any interest in the plot itself.Some of the stunts do look cool, especially for those of us who are not exposed to enough Hollywood. That seems to be Bang Bang's first selling point - Bang Bang, the machine gun kind and not the other kind that the movie itself admits there isn't enough of. You have the works - bikes, cars, race cars even, choppers, boats, water skis and what not. You have Hrithik Roshan flying down buildings and cliffs and emerging up from the deep seas. But, you know they are there just for the sake of being there. More of the ""cool"" idea leading to its insertion in the film rather than the story requiring the creativity of the cool idea. Pretty much same goes for the film's second selling point - Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif - the gorgeous looking people that they are, they supposedly don't require character devlopment, depth or even a half-decent story or even decent chemistry. Just the presense of the actors ought to keep the audience happy. For the sake of completeness, then I will mention the most obvious - their abdominal muscles certainly worked out more than the facial muscles. Body language? Baah! Who needs that when you have the body? Any attempt at injecting emotion then, seems farcical. Not that emotion has much of a place in this film. So what, if it's has patriotism at its chore and wants to be a revenge drama. You'd think there would be a little more room for good song and dance in a film like this, especially given Hrithink Roshan's presence. But that too is too much to ask for. Just in case, you are still wondering, the entire plot is pretty much pointless given the ""twist"" in the climax. Since the film then has no  more selling points, it resorts to blatant product placements so much so that after Krrish 3 now, I have started associating Hrithik Roshan with product placement. And yet, I can't completely put the film down. At least, true-blue action stunts are being attempted. They might not have been executed well, but hopefully it will get better with the next film or the next. Meanwhile, though this is meant for some other long weekend, one which has the film running on TV with the luxury of flipping channels. ]"
70,"[The complexity of the situation in Pakistan deserves a lot of attention from pop culture and all types of art for it to reach us, people far-removed from the situation.  To have it portrayed in mainstream cinema is a necessity. To have it so beautifully adapted into a Shakespearean tragedy is a luxury I couldn't have imagined possible. For if there is a land that is free yet imprisoned like Hamlet describes, Kashmir would be one of the top contenders. The rest of the departments are so dedicated to the topic and the play that they all fit like a jigsaw puzzle. After being enamored by the adaptation to Kashmir, the next thing that stuck me was Shahid Kapoor's performance. He stands tall bang in the middle of power house performers like Kay Kay Menon and Tabu, a feat that I never would have thought him to be capable of. Two sequences are stuck in my memory and I see myself forgiving him many Phata Poster Nikla Heros and R...Rajkumaars for those two sequences, one of which is actually a dance performance. Another scene that was completely taken over by an actor, unsurprisingly had Irrfan Khan. These sequences are lovely examples of all departments of film-making coming together in perfect synchronization - story writing, dialogue writing, scene (and dance) choreography, the setting and of course the performances. If there is a way to incorporate song and dance in a perfectly serious film, it is the way in which Haider's trick play was done. The graveyard song would have worked even better if only it flowed into the film a little more smoothly. Unfortunately, the way it is in the film, it seems a little abrupt instead of hitting hard the way it had potential to.Similarly, because the story is not all linear, the back and forth builds up well, but it also flattens a little before half-time. The pace is a little more uneven in the second half. But, these are minor quibbles very easily forgivable because of the dialogue, the performances and the beauty of Kashmir. It must be difficult to resist the temptation of setting the contrast of the gorgeousness of Kashmir against what man has made out of it. Blood and gore against the purity of white snow. And this is when the film is set in fall and winter, not even Kashmir in its spring. After having seen films week-after-week and knowing there are so many more to be seen out there, very few inspire you to watch it again. And even fewer because each department played its role very close to perfection. Vishal Bharadwaj's Haider is one of those rare ones. Yes, I will certainly watch this one again. Soon. ]"
71,"[Though far from perfect, writer-director Scott Frank's A Walk Among the Tombstones, adapted from a Lawrence Block novel of the same name, comes across as a refreshing change. Perhaps it was the sight of Liam Neeson in the publicity material that caused one to fear that the film would once again have Neeson play what he's been doing so frequently in the recent past. Thankfully enough, his character as well as the film itself are treated with rare patience.Set in the year 1999 (the period building up to the greatest of anti-climaxes, that Y2K non-event), Neeson plays Matt Scudder, a recovering alcoholic and retired (for a reason) NYPD cop who now takes up cases as a private investigator, even if he is an unlicensed one. A Walk Among the Tombstones has an intriguing air about it, all the way through. Aided greatly by Mihai Malaimare Jr. 's  cinematography, but propelled mostly by Scott Frank's mature, stoic handling of the film, it is the atmosphere of the film that is its biggest strength. Reminiscent often of Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners (though not nearly as haunting), the film unfolds at its own gentle pace. Apart from the mature treatment, the film also gives us a more real hero than we've come to expect from any Hollywood film lately, let alone one that has Liam Neeson in the lead. It is great to see him not effortlessly mowing down multiple baddies at one go, actually get beaten up a little bit himself, but still show the spirit to carry on. In one of the best scenes of the film, a man draws a knife on Scudder; the way the scene eventually plays out will surprise you, and it will underline why sometimes it makes so much sense to infuse realism into cinema.The film also gives us a pair of unlikely bad guys. David Harbour, who plays one of them, is terrific in particular. There is something chilling about the remorseless way in which they do what they do, though their background and motivations aren't sufficiently explained. My other grouse with the film was the fact that the slow pace and spine-tingling ambiance all seemed to be building up to something that would grab at your gut, but that doesn't quite happen. The film still will have your stomach in a knot for the most, but amping up the shock value somewhere would perhaps have served the film well.Then again, you realize that that never seemed to be the director's intention in the first place. There's a message or two in the film (through the character of Scudder himself, as well as his interactions with a homeless boy named T.J.); there's a vacant, sepulchral feel that draws you in; and there's a nice turn by a terrific actor playing a character truly worth rooting for. That was what Scott Frank always seemed to hold as his trump cards, and they're what deliver a decent film - one that demands patience, yes, but which ultimately rewards you with that feeling of having inhabited a world outside of your own.]"
72,"[Mental check-list while walking in the theater to neutralize skepticism created by the promos -10...9...It's Dharma productions - have a nagging feeling that they must have caught the violently contagious disease that's in the air these days called self-referencing.

But it also has Shilpa Shetty literally all over both Abhishek Bachchan (Sam) and John Abraham (Kunal). Just so no one can complain. All the boys in the house need a gorgeous, barely-clad woman to drool over. And girls can take their pick - John 'Perfect V' Abraham just after a swim on the beach or the casually dressed Abhishek nodding his head in style. Though most of the apprehensions mentioned above were appropriately done justice to, a lot of the mental preparation seemed to have worked. Because I was pleasantly surprised to hear myself laugh at regular intervals - Thanks to the situations created and some brilliant timing by Abhishek Bachchan. However, John is back to being a part of the furniture as far as acting goes.Sure the jokes were intended to take advantage of the way the audience laughs at gay people. But, the situations they were places in made it funny. No credit to the dialogues though. Their only function was to remind us that they are cool enough to use the word 'gay' openly - every 10th minute. Anyway, like all good things, the laughter soon dried up too, largely due to repetition. And stop using the 'brother from another mother' line already!It is amazing how a simple, sweet concept can be completely ruined by keeping the narrative absolutely flat. The superficial conflict is treated ever so lightly that you can't let the superfluous drama get you involved. Sam and Kunal both get annoyed, anxious, jealous, apologetic and turn into perfect arseholes (what else can people who use Taare Zameen Par to manipulate children be called?) at the exact same time. Was one character at conception stage split into two to give it the gay angle? And of course there's no necessity to show a single bonding moment between the males, they are after all so similar. Neha (Priyanka Chopra) does have a shade more detailed character. But even those details seem to be just there as tokens rather than serving an arc. Yet, Priyanka sincerely expresses whatever Neha is going through. This is her fourth movie this year and yet she brings freshness to the screen. There's something superbly charming and warm about her and the way she carries herself. Can't blame her if Neha's feelings don't have a logical flow to them or if one moment all she cares about is her job and soon enough it barely matters.Fluidity is in general lacking around here. I'm not talking about characters transforming by a preachy one-liner (remember the deep breathing exercises before the show?). It's the absence of even that one-liner. I'll thank the climax for all the eye exercises it helped me with - so much eye-rolling I haven't done in a long long time.The focus is on mockery here. Mockery of how the gay behave and of how they are perceived too. Mockery of how parents react when they know their child is homosexual and of how blinding love can really be. A movie on relationships and friendships, yeah right! Not this one.]"
73,"[Good romantic comedies are few and far between. Well, of course, I mean the ones that make you laugh and go ""awwww"" alternately. There are others that try and you wish they hadn't. Khoobsurat has honest moments that make you want to fall in love all over again and times when you laugh out loud. That is not to say it doesn't have cliches and all things that go with the word Disney, prince and princesses. In that sense, Khoobsurat (2014) differs from Khoobsurat (1980) in one significant way. The focus is much more on romance here than it is on binding the family, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The further a remake steers from the original, the better its chances of working. The biggest surprise is Sonam Kapoor. It's like she has left herself loose, like she has finally gotten comfortable in front of the camera. In many ways, she reminded me more of Kareena Kapoor in Jab We Met and Katrina Kaif in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara more than Rekha from the original Khoobsurat. Doesn't help that the characters are all similar, but more to do with how stiff these women were in the films before these and these films saw them let go. There are a few other charming details (other than the prince himself, more on him later). The supporting characters from King Rathod's aide, Ramsevak to King Rathod himself; from the prince's little sister Divya to her mom, Her highness, Nirmala Rathod (her first name a nod to the corresponding character in the original film). The characters have slight flourishes to them that keep you interested and are played out very well by the actors themselves. The only sore thumb being in the form of Kirron Kher. Isn't she done playing the loud Punjabi mom just yet? I understand the Punjabi background comes in handy when you want to show that the genes transferred is what produces the uber-chirpy Mili (Sonam Kapoor). But, it is just tiring to see that stereotype. What it helps though is to accentuate the stark contrast between Mili and Prince Vikram (Fawad Khan). Fawaad Khan has a lovely restraint about his persona. It is like this role was meant for him and him only. While he needs to hold just one expression through most of the film, when he does need to deviate, he does it with the slightest change and yet makes it believable. What also keeps things believable in this palatial setting are some very day-to-day one-liners. The kind you and I would quip nonchalantly and laugh hard over. Some of the situations created and the way they are resolved are rather normal too. And normal in a way that doesn't bore you. That part of real life that you don't mind seeing on reel. Not to mention, for a change the voiceovers that start out sounding awkward turn into amusing train of thoughts that every one has, when they are thinking one thing and saying another. Another thing which though I really loved, am not sure if it went with the tone for the film was Sneha Khanwalkar's music. It has such a lovely quirky ring to it that you are thankful for its existence irrespective of whether or not it was meant for the said film. I don't if I should be happy or sad that they had someone else do the end-credit song. Where Khoobsurat misses out then is when characters transition. Perfectly consistent characters that have grown on you, change suddenly. It all seems a bit too convenient. A little too predictable with no effort at masking the predictability. The movie wasn't going to end any other way, you know it and so do I. But some effort at staying away from typicality would've kept the tone of the film through till the end.Yet, it's something I would recommend for a light Sunday afternoon. It is guilty pleasure. It is saccharine sweet and fluffy. It is candy floss - it won't satiate your appetite, but will feel good while you are at it and a little after. ]"
74,"[Daawat-e-ishq starts out with strongly with its theme again dowry. It makes you belch at the people who ask for dowry, just in case you weren't already there. Which is fine and you wonder where its going to take you from here. You fly into this bizarre zone where One lie begets another and things mess up considerably. Only to end with a quick and convenient solution, not to mention predictable. Yet the earnestness in the performances and the issue the film supports keep you reasonably engaged.Parineeti Chopra, Aditya Roy Kapoor and Anupam Kher are all completely comfortable under the skin of their characters. In fact, Parineeti Chopra (Gullu) seems repetitive considering the Gullu is runs parallel to the characters she played in Ladies vs Ricky Bahl and Ishaqzaade. Anupam Kher amazes no end, for the first few seconds he is on screen, I almost didn't realise it was him, given his accent, mannerism and dialogue delivery. Sure, he slips every now and then as the film progresses, but those first few seconds stay with you. Aditya Roy Kapoor too makes you believe the rawness of his character, Tariq even though Tariq himself is rather liberated compared to the backstory he has. That is what charms you about Daawat-e-ishq. It has the most unbelievable situations and the characters go back and forth in their dilemmas depending on the situation they are presented with. Yet you kind-of sort-of want them to behave the way they do at every juncture of the story. It is a rarity in Hindi films, this mixture of wanting characters to behave in a certain way irrespective of how unbelievable it is.The rest then, the songs, the accent, the Hyderabadi/Lucknowi flavor are all mere salt and pepper added to cover the bland even if silly meat of the film. In fact, the last stretch of the film feels like even the makers realised that they've brought the film to such a twisted point that there is no smooth and natural way to unwind. It had to be done by hook or crook and that's pretty much what happens.In a way, these convoluted mechanisms take away from the social issue that the film so passionately wants to support. You are left wondering what the film is in fact saying about the situation of the dowry system of the country. You might be dead sure that it is a horrific system, but having it intertwined with the desperate measures dowry givers have to make shifts focus. A film with this issue at its heart might not want to be at a place where there are ifs and buts around the issue. ]"
75,"[A film that starts with a voiceover, however lovely the voice and what it has to say, feels likes a cop out. Save for a couple of times, I have felt that the voiceover is just an escape from having to show us the characters, instead you are just told about them. Almost, as if you were reading out the character wikipedia entry. Finding Fanny warms up after this initial put-off, only to set into a routine very soon. From then on it is flat, if not a ride on a downward slope.When the ride starts and the film gets into second gear I loved how enterprising Angie (Deepika Padukone)  is in getting the other characters join the road-trip to find Freddie's (Naseeruddin Shah) love Fanny. She has each one of them believe it was their decision to make them do what she wants them to do. The means and the end are equally quirky. But, then that is the peak of the eccentricity. After this point the craziness is either too forced (a la a caricatured Vladimir) or too flat. This is a shame because individually the characters are uniquely funny. The humor is dark and it plays out quite well. Yes, of course, each one of the characters is a caricature, some more so than the others, yet they are entertaining and engaging. Savio (Arjun Kapoor) the most normal of them all, is also the flattest character - maybe because he is normal. His outburst though comes out of nowhere. But in this crazy bunch, he brings a bit of a balance along with Angie. Angie is sweet, composed and a romantic. At the same time she is creative and gives a whiff that if she has made up her mind, she can get what she wants. This is why, her character's arch seems to be a little too out there. Given that she has the confidence of getting away with anything, it is a mystery why she waited so long for what was playing on her mind. Her strong-headed mother-in-law, Rosie (Dimple Kapadia) on the other hand is the coconut of the group - hard on the outside hiding a soft inner self, but feeling empty deep within. Now see, herein lies the biggest flaw of the film. This thing that Rosie is empty deep within, is not something that I deduced because of what went on in the film, it is because another character spells it out. Again, out of nowhere. That character being Pedro (Pankaj Kapoor). Easily the quirkiest of them all, Pedro is shallow and openly so. His pervert eye is omnipresent in the film and uncomfortable, even though deep down you know he won't be causing too much harm. It is a bit of a shocker when he makes an insightful observation of another character then. I'm not saying people who are overtly shallow are incapable of making deeper inferences. It's just that when the remark comes, not only is it over-dramatic which makes it out of place in this otherwise non-dramatic film, but it also comes out of nowhere. Do you see, the trend here. The way the characters behave towards the end are very uncharacteristic of the way they have been defined for us till then. It almost made me feel like the end was written before everything else and everything else that came before was a means to that end. For a film that seemed to be about enjoying the journey this is too much of a mismatch. I am all for characters behaving out of character, but I feel left-out and thus uninterested if I am not in on what brought about the deviation?The only consistent character then is that of Freddie whose quest is at the center of the film. His quest for finding his love. The beauty of his search is that it's not with the intention of wanting reciprocation. He just wants his feelings known. Unfortunately, the way the quest ends is such a bummer then. Yes, Finding Fanny is more about these characters than it is about the story itself. Which is why each of these characters needed a little more to them than just an initial character sketch. A little more detail, a little more backstory. Thankfully, the characters had brilliant actors to play them out. I doubt there is any other word that would describe him other than ""sulky"" - which might be the one-word brief he got from the director; which is what he portrays very well and consistently by sulking. Deepika Padukone plays Angie the reason for Savio's sulk. She is very aware of her affect on him and uses it too. There was this glimpse of what a wonderful actor she can be in Love Aaj Kal. Finding Fanny allows her to show us that through the film and she makes the most of it. She uses her eyes to convey it all.A complain that is held against the character, Rosie, but can never be held against the actor that plays her Dimple Kapadia. As gorgeous as ever, padded hips notwithstanding, the lady stumps me every time I see her on screen with how well she makes me forget the actor that's playing it. And I could and would use the exact same words to describe Naseeruddin Shah's portrayal of Freddie. The only one who stuck out for me as an over-done is Pankaj Kapoor. I am sure that was on the director's command. But, he sticks out like a sore thumb with the exaggerated portrayal of his character's craziness. Sure, he's done it well, but wouldn't the challenge have been a better one to underplay that zany character to fit in with the rest of the film?A word on the Goan atmosphere and language before I close - it really worked for me. So did the background music, even if it were too loud at times. It would indeed have been nice to experiment with a few scenes, especially the romantic ones, without any music. Another film, maybe. Once again something that sticks out as forced. Which can be said about the film's summary that Angie spells out for us in the end. Such a clean-cut, sliced and diced ending is not what a dark humored film like this one deserves. Even so, it is nice to have a change of pace and scenery from the typical Hindi film. Always welcome. ]"
76,"[If you're keen on watching Sin City: A Dame To Kill For, there's a good chance you're a fan of Robert Rodriguez's first Sin City, both of which are based on graphic novels by Frank Miller. (Rodriguez shares director credit with Miller because of how he faithfully recreates images from the graphic novels.)The first one went down as a cult film. It was disruptive, entertaining, and it had those gorgeous high-contrast, black-and-white frames that made it a visual treat. Visually, A Dame To Kill For follows the first. It also still is pulpy and intriguing, but it just doesn't have the same taut writing and execution that made Sin City so much fun. On the contrary, it seems like this one is trying too hard.It picks up characters and some threads of story from the first film, adds some new characters into the fray, and follows a similar parallel narrative structure as we see the deteriorating morality and abject disregard for law-and-order that we're quite familiar with in the fictional Basin City, popularly called Sin City, because, you know, that name suits it and its residents better.That's just a sanitized way of describing the film, of course - it is all about money, power, sex and crime. (Though you won't get much of number 3 on that list if you watch it on the big screen, thanks to our censor board. There are some pretty blatant cuts, usually accompanied by groans from what seems to be a rather deprived urban audience.)The most welcome addition to that cast and storyline is Eva Green, who plays a moral-less, cold-hearted schemer who possesses an uncanny power over men, who she uses and tramples over as and when it suits her. Hence the tag line of the film. Green seems to have made a habit out of being the best thing about the sequels she stars in (remember 300: Rise of an Empire?), but she doesn't quite give this film the sting that it deserved.Though the film is briskly paced, it seems longer than its 100-minute run time because most of the film is narrated by voice-overs of the characters - which pretty much outline the what, when and why of things through philosophical-sounding rants attempting to pass off as story-telling. You want the film to grab at your gut, that's what you expect from Sin City. But it ends up being feeble. Part of the reason could be the fact that cinema audiences have changed since the first film came out, and there is a lot more exposure and understanding of blurring moral lines today. So obviously, unless this film significantly upped its game in the 'let's shake things up a bit' department, it wouldn't nearly have the same kind of impact as one would have hoped.The other additions to the cast - Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Josh Brolin - make hay while the darkness shines, but you somehow end up feeling that they were just going through the motions; as does Robert Rodriguez, to be honest. It still is good fun watching an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke as Marv pounding guys just for the heck of it, or the ladies of Old Town being the deadly rear guard that they revel in being, but the film still just doesn't ever make you feel like you're witnessing something spectacular. As a companion piece to the first, it would make for a fair lazy weekend DVD watch, but that's about it. Besides, you want to watch this film uncut, because let's face it - Sin City isn't quite the same without the sex.I'm a big fan of Robert Rodriguez, mainly because of his story - the way he chased his passion for cinema despite having next to nothing, and ended up being an A-list Hollywood director. (For cinephiles, his book 'Rebel Without A Crew' is a must read.) Despite having an up-and-down filmography, he always seemed like someone who wanted to push the envelope. His last few films, though, haven't quite seemed that way. Let's hope he gets his act together soon, hopefully in a far more thrilling Sin City 3, in case he plans to make it.]"
77,"[Yes, Mary Kom the film is much more dramatized and fictionalized than I had expected, but Mary Kom the character has so much grit that even if the real life Mary Kom is half as gutsy and strong-willed, she makes for a story that inspires. Unfortunately though that you have to do - discount a lot of the story. It's a shame that the makers didn't find the true story exciting enough and chose to spice events up for their convenience. I understand, some times that is what a commercial film needs, but it shouldn't be done to such an extent that you start questioning every episode you see on screen. So much so that, I came home to check the chronology of some events and was hugely disappointed with the way the timing of the climax (including the opponent Mary Kom plays) is changed around for filmy effect. I shouldn't be made to wait to get to Google to look up Mary Kom's life, I should want to be with the film for a long, long time. Then for a person who knows nothing about boxing, I wonder if the technicalities of boxing were shown appropriately. Without wanting to look it up (more because of disinterest rather than anything else) I am willing to place my money on boxing technicalities being totally ignored. It does look like an ill-researched project or worse, one where well-done research is intentionally disregarded.You then have the narrative itself. The screenplay is way too episodic almost like you are watching the film one short chapter after another. Almost as if to cover this drawback, the first half of the film even tries its hand at non-linear narration. Else, there is no particular reason to take us back and forth on the timeline.It is heartening though, that all these gaps in writing are sidelined by the best efforts of the cast. Priyanka Chopra and Darshan Kumaar are all equally earnest in their performances. At times, the dialogue help at others the filminess distracts but you cannot put the dialogue delivery at fault. This is despite the distracting make-up, colored and straightened hair, where none belonged. The actors make you root for the real-life people. If not for the blatant product placement, you would feel their pain with them too. While a husband's support for his wife's career, especially such a demanding one should be a given, not every one gets it. Less so, in small-town or rural India. I am happy that Mary Kom's husband, Onler's sacrifices and contribution received as much screen time as it did. This is an inspirational story of its own. And oh the irony of seeing sugar free, Iodex and Usha advertise their way into a film about one of the country's  athletes who in real-life struggled to find sponsors and financial support for most of her career. I guess we should just be thankful that there were no item numbers to make the film commercially appealing.So, would I take my kids to the theater to watch this one? Unlikely, will certainly not make extra effort. But would want them to watch it when it's on TV, just to see the power of strong will. Fortunately or unfortunately, it's not for the cinema, it's for the real-life person who deserved a film about her life. It is also interesting that a biopic has been made of a person whose career is still on. So for all you know, the story isn't over yet and we have the chance for an even more inspirational Mary Kom 2 at our hands, and hopefully a better film too. ]"
78,"[Being a student of science is supposedly something extraordinary in the world of Bhagnanis. That is why they spend a significant part of the first hour in telling us how their lead hero is unique because Physics interests him. But actually what makes him irreplacable is that he knows how to sweep a woman of her feet, fight 5 ""machos"", have muscles that are worth showing off, move his feet to put the Hrithik Roshans of the day to shame...if you think I'm exaggerating, blame the writers of the film!If, so far, you haven't been reminded of the superhero of the 90s, take this. This story supposedly has comedy, drama, suspense, melodrama, romance, revenge, more drama, and I'm sure I'm missing a genre or two. And yet not one bit is entertaining. Each element looked like a part of a scene was first visualized and then the scenario was built around it with no connections to the scenarios before or after. Be it the fight sequences or the romantic ones. So, we have Jacky Bhagnani - an Uday Chopra look-alike who cringes his nose and expresses sadness with a blank face like Fardeen Khan. Giving credit where it's due, he can't do it as annoyingly as Fardeen. Then there's Vaishali Desai who is annoying because she's arrogant - for what, I haven't a clue. The worst-worst hit is seeing Riteish Deshmukh play comic relief and he doesn't get more than a laugh. That hurts, it really does. That Archana Puran Singh is a little less irritating than usual is hardly any consolation. Neither the hero nor the villain and none in between have interesting characters. The hero is of course the hero - ever-so-nice 24x7 with one and all, including people who insult him for no rhyme or reason. The villain doesn't inspire us to even raise a finger at him, let alone hate him. His motivations are unknown and we aren't motivated to find out either. Like most films of this nature, the songs come and go like guests as if the film was a cheap motel. No rhythm, nor need. The lyrics a tad better than one would expect in a set-up like this. The theater usher asked a girl who had just watched the film, ""how did you like the film?"" Her answer says it all. ""Sad..."" And you thought there was no tragedy in the film. ]"
79,"[You have an innocent looking child. He is poor. He has to work hard. And then you see a gleam in his eye for something unreachable. What's there not to like about stories like these? Especially when there are reasonably decent performances. Hawaa Hawaai is yet another story that inspires to reach out for your passion. At the same time, It attempts at sensitizing you to the issues of child labour in Mumbai slums - which is nice, even if a little too in-the-face. It is yet another story that you can watch. The only problem is the words ""yet another"".Hawaa Hawaai's story has a very ""been there, seen that"" feeling about it. The melodrama doesn't help its case. And then it has a preachy undertone, which borderline beats its own purpose. The good thing is, every time it goes into one of these zones, it manages to get back on track pretty quickly. In fact, it even makes some points rather subtly, in contrast to its own style thus far. The writing is very simple. The story doesn't dig deep into its characters, nor does it even try to create too many ups and downs. In fact, the first down that our protagonist Arjun aka Raju (Partho Gupte) sees came way after I thought, ""isn't this all happening too easily for him?"" The beauty is that you don't mind things working out easily for Arjun. His character and situation has been built up such that it'd be wrong of you not to sympathize with his condition instantaneously. Yes, the film is  pretty judgmental about its audience. It wants to educate. It wants to sensitize. All very noble, except that it gets patronizing every once in a while. Fortunately, the combined effort of the actors, doesn't allow the patronizing to become overwhelming. Partho Gupte's earnest performance; Saqib Salim's enthusiastic one; and the knowing irony that the four kids in Arjun's gang bring out together don't allow you to get bogged down with the overt effort to sensitize.I also found myself intermittently tuning off the lyrics to the songs playing in the background. One, there were way too many of them. Two, the music wasn't too great. Three, the lyrics are predictable. In any case, will I take my kids to watch this one? Yes, for sure. And hopefully, that will contribute to efforts in inspiring some form of social responsibility in them. That - Hawaa Hawaai might be perfect for. ]"
80,"[Metro city dwellers who rarely, if ever, face severe power crises, probably take their access to electricity for granted. But for a large portion of India outside the biggest cities, daily prolonged power cuts because of deficits in generation and supply, are still a sad reality.Katiyabaaz, a documentary on the pitiful state of affairs with regard to electricity in Kanpur, is quite an eye opener. Not only does it succinctly and memorably highlight the key aspects of the subject it deals with, but it also is pretty much a reminder of what is wrong with India today.Narrated by following two diverse points of view - one of a katiyabaaz (a term for someone who provides illegal electricity connections), and the other of a bureaucrat who headed Kanpur Electricity Supply Company Ltd or KESCO - the film takes us through the gamut of problems that the citizens face, and the lengths they go to in an attempt to fix it.The former, Loha Singh, is who one you could consider the target audience of Salman bhai's Eid releases. He is flashy, funny, garrulous, belligerent and has a rather disproportionate sense of self worth. And yes, he manages to come up with some outrageous one-liners. But what one would notice most about him if one observes him carefully, is his willingness to tread moral lines. You see, here is a man who knows he's doing something illegal, but who feels he has the right to do so, because he has been screwed over by the system, the villain.Symbolising this villain is Ritu Maheshwari, who assumes KESCO's reigns at one of its worst periods. She is honest, intelligent and seems to genuinely want to change the system. One really feels for her, as she tries her best to set things straight, crack down on power theft so that electricity can be distributed better, and attempt to connect to consumers better through the use of technology. Yet, there is only so much a bureaucrat can do when the populace is stubborn and the political leadership is ineffective in providing better infrastructure.The film rather beautifully captures the flavour of Kanpur, which is as enchanting as any other place in Uttar Pradesh, never mind the sorry plight of law and order in the state. It is gut-wrenching to think of a city that was once known as the Manchester of the East because of its former glory days as a centre of industry, reduced to shambles as a place that suffers daily power cuts of as long as 15 hours. (Oh, and its former name, Cawnpore, has such an old world charm to it!)The film treads shaky ground, however, when you consider how it has been treated. Situations that would have been a surreptitious part of daily life in Kanpur take place in front of the camera, and hence they end up looking staged. Loha Singh in particular, while a hoot in his interviews, seems to be playing to the gallery when not talking directly to the camera. He seems conscious of the fact that he has a shot at doing what his cinema idol does - perform for an audience - and he seems to relish the idea. These portions of the film - the ones that appear fake (for want of a better word) - are where the film's intentions come into question, even though it carefully avoids taking any actual sides.Still, the film unfolds with the pace and style of a thriller, before it ends on a high that raises questions that one would really like to delve deeper into. If this is what it takes to popularize the documentary format in India, then so be it. But Katiyabaaz is a film that every Indian will identify with and learn from, if they truly want to.]"
81,"[Raja Natwarlal has a few very interesting twists and a few edge-of-the-seat moments. But the fact that the person in the soup gets out way too easily, the person who is supposed to be duped is conned too easily and the utlimate climax is a little too simplistic - all take away from the thrills that are set-up. It does engage only to fizzle out too soon. A prime example of this is the climax. The build-up to the climax is truly engaging. It has the appropriate twists, it has the perfect measure of the hero being caught in a tight spot, you really want to know how he is going to squeeze out of this one, but the climax itself is as lame as it gets. An anti-climax of sorts.These dips after a reasonable high comes across as lazy writing. Given that there is hardly any effort spent on according depth to the characters, and the dialogue is simple except for the lines for Paresh Rawal's character, the high in the thrilling situations is the only thing that makes the story kick. It is unfortunate, that a film with one of the best cliff-hangers I have seen at interval, isn't able to retain the interest. Emraan Hashmi and Paresh Rawal perfectly pose as the smart Alek and the experienced conman respectively. Paresh Rawal's introduction in fact is equally amusing and cool - the kind of arrogance and smart that you think is deserved. But, he doesn't get to show much of that off later in the film. Kay Kay Menon too starts out as a menacing character but later tones down. Though he makes the most of the bits given to him, as we are used to expecting now. Humaima Malick brings nothing to the table in terms of her performance. In fact, Deepak Tijori with his short, restrained yet comfortable appearance leaves a longer impression. The main problem with Raja Natwarlal is it is different from the conman films we are used to. Yes, and unfortunately, ""different"" goes against the film. It takes itself too seriously. Other films of this genre like Bluffmaster or Bunty Aur Babli have a slick, sweet humor about them that doesn't allow the story to dip. Even Khosla Ka Ghosla, in fact - which also suffers from the other problem of a very smart businessman turning gullible to suit the story's requirement - has a subtle humor about it which keeps that smile intact. Even so, Raja Natwarlal can be a casual TV watch which you won't regret. Especially, since you can forward/switch channels when the run-time lengthening, otherwise irrelevant songs show up. ]"
82,"[As the first few scenes unfold I try to imagine the understandable reaction of an audience that is fed on mainstream Hindi cinema. ""Titillating!"", ""Voyeuristic!!"", ""Despicable!!!"" Maybe audiences that are exposed to cinema from the world will have a similar reaction too. This is not what we do in 'our' movies. So what if almost every movie boasts a pole-dance in the name of 'item number' with the most suggestive lyrics?! Even so, I'd have agreed with them if the characters in Dev D didn't move beyond their basic needs, if they didn't try to understand each other. Or if they didn't have reasonable motivation. Or if they, like normal human beings, didn't move on from one pain to another. It's all there. Not completely satisfying, but it's there. Not entirely smoothly but you are introduced to the characters. Even though most of us might not identify with them, we begin to enjoy them. The offense to the Indian psyche starts its onslaught with the guy who is adamant and outright disrespectful towards his elders. A girl in love can go to any extent to please her man. Another frustrated, violated, unloved teenager rebels when friends and family desert her. Each one a very strong character. And all three condemn themselves to self-destruction - even if one of them takes a socially acceptable path. But, then something goes wrong. The writing in terms of the story just loses its charm mid-way. The strong characters turn limp as if the writers lost interest. Fortunately the dialogue stays crisp and smart. But, all the foreplay doesn't lead to anything exciting. No home-run after third base? Tut-tut....It's not our culture to express our sexuality. We have the urge. 1,00,00,00,000 don't happen just like that! But, Shushhh! We purge the need to talk about it. And here you have the three main characters lusting like there's no tomorrow - on the big screen at that!  Scandalous!! But, HOLD ON...It's explicit by implication not by expression. Not so much as a kiss in it for us to make a fuss about. And yet it comes across as imprudent. Sure the language is refreshingly candid. It's not exactly everyday language only because not all people can think on their feet like that. And this is what sets Dev D apart. It's almost as if the camera is just waiting for a nudge, to be pushed to capture what might be happening under that bush. But the makers enjoy teasing the audience better. Of course, this also helps in escaping the censor scissor. It's an Anurag Kashyap movie. By definition it has to try and show the society a mirror. He comments on the double standards of men and spells it out through dialogue, just in case you were trying to overlook it. The film talks about sex not only as an obsession, but also as a form of possession - this person is mine because he/she makes love with me. It drills the angst down in the songs. Almost constantly, there are words in the background song telling you something insightful if you care to pay attention. Incidentally, it was the first time I saw audience singing a song out loud in a theater. How can I leave Abhay Deol's charm or dialogue delivery skills out? O-kay, his smile and dimples too! Yet his character,  Dev's attitude made me want to slap him. Maybe because he portrays Dev's audacity that well, or maybe because Mahie Gill played Paro as if there wasn't any effort involved. I didn't need to understand much of Punjabi to know what was on this girl's mind! Am I the only one who felt like I was watching Tabu? However, the chemistry between Abhay and Mahie is completely missing when Kalki Koechlin and Abhay get together. Kalki didn't seem 100% comfortable and thus looked a little pretentious. Dev D represents what some of the urban youth go through today. Their candor, their confidence, their conceit, their sexual desires, their redefinition of true love. It's a story told and retold over decades, in literature and on screen. But it's more open, more bold. Unfortunately, it also feels like it's half-told. ]"
83,"[It is just so refreshing to watch a Hindi film that has not been lengthened by forcing in a romantic track and songs. I understand, that shouldn't be a reason to bump any film's rating up. Unfortunately for the film, that is one of the main things you come out with. NOT the social issue it is trying to create awareness about. Till the film starts getting preachy and goes into a monologue, Mardaani is a well-narrated story with all the elements in-sync. But, the last fifteen minutes is downhill towards any typical thriller.That is not to say, that the action in the last bit is not engaging. It is in fact very slick and Rani Mukherjee moves smartly. But, a voiceover that explains how things worked out, is the biggest turn-off in a thriller. And it is a shame because till then Mardaani didn't have a single dull moment. It's not that the plot twists weren't forseeable. You could see, some of the biggest turning points in the story from a few minutes before they happened. But, since you are rooting for the right thing to happen, you don't mind the predictability.The writing to a great extent keeps you intrigued by one means or the other. Even though, it has the usual trappings of a supercop film. Like, showing the cop's happy family for one and only one reason. And of course, there are loopholes or leaps of faith. On the other hand, there are other things the writing department takes head-on. The dialogue is witty, even if the way the abuses are delivered sound forced, for effect, rather than natural. But, other than that the lines bring a smile or make you smirk. The lead characters are written reasonably well too. The topic of sexual trafficking is such that the audience is already rooting for the story. In addition, Mardaani's bad guy instills fear appropriately. Also, a rarity in Hindi films, you see and enjoy a vibrant chemistry between the protagonist and the antagonist. This with Shivani (Rani Mukherjee) and the villain (Tahir Bhasin) hardly being in the same physical space. Again, it's not too often when both the sides are equally smart, cool and unfazed. Of course, this wouldn't have worked hadn't it been for Rani Mukherjee and Tahir Bhasin's performances. Though Rani Mukherjee starts out being loud, but you soon get used it, because the character is written that way. She's strong and  has a fight in her. Always. It is commendable that there is not an ounce of glamor around Rani Mukherjee and she stays in character throughout. My usual gripe with movies that address social issues is they make some characters (usually the main leads) representative of a larger group of people say, the youth or women or the common man. Which is not bad in itself, but the story slips in and out from being about the character and being symbolic of the said group. Mardaani saves itself from that trap for most of the film. It is telling you the story of this one lady officer who has taken it upon herself to get to the bad guy for a personal reason (to start with) and it moves on to being about a larger purpose. It is also refreshing that the film doesn't make much ado about it being women-centric. It sticks to the points of one - being a thriller and two - talking about trafficking. Sort-of neutralises the fact that a film with a woman at the center is ironically called, Mardaani.Yes, child trafficking for sexual crimes needs awareness. Yes, more and more films need to be made on such issues. Yes, Mardaani is a decent film. Alas, the issue is not what you come out thinking about. I wonder if there were censor cuts that took away bits that were needed to get us more involved with those who suffered. But, meanwhile, this will do. And go give, Lakshmi a watch too. Note, I am not saying instead, I am saying both. Each has a different approach - only that one is worth a watch and the other ought to be watched. ]"
84,"[There are two kinds of 'predictability' you come across when you're watching a film. The first, more commonly occurring type, is when you absolutely know where the story is headed, because the writer and director had no imagination while scripting and making the film; the 'yawn' kind of the predictability. The second, which is so rare, particularly in our films, is when your characters are so well etched out that there is really no other step the person would have taken when faced with a particular situation. It doesn't jar; it just feels, for want of a better word, natural.I was pleasantly surprised, then, when Anjali Menon's Bangalore Days had a lot of the second kind of predictability. Now if you look at the run-time of the film - just a shade under 3 hours - you wonder why a film that is about young people and by inference, targeted primarily at young people, would be so long. (We've reached a stage where not many have that kind of an attention span, and most films hover around the 2 - 2.5 hour mark.) The answer, again, lies in the characterization. The characters are given room to breathe, explore and discover themselves. Bangalore Days, thus, surprised me on multiple levels. The three main characters, Arjun, Divya and Krishnan (fondly called Kuttetan), are cousins. Extremely close to each other while growing up in Kerala, they always promised each other that they'd go to Bangalore when they were older. As it turns out, their life takes them exactly there; and their journey is something truly worth sharing.Handled with a surprising amount of patience and maturity, we get involved in each of their stories equally. Newly-married Divya's problems with a reticent husband - the fourth important character in the film; Kuttetan's yearning for a simple, Malayali girl who'll make him happy; and the nomad Arjun's journey towards internal stability; each of these tales could have been a story in itself. Put together, though, it makes for a soul-stirring ride. Because not only is each of the characters written well, but their relationships with each other have also been crafted with love. They stand by each other, fight, make up and pull each other along beautifully.Yes, the film has its share of 'twists' that seem a tad out of place. But one way to look at them is to find out how our primary characters will deal with them. So what eventually make the twists work is the fact that they tie in with the lives of the characters beautifully. The film is also about little moments, little deft touches which add a wonderful texture to the story. I don't want to give anything away, but these little moments show that a lot of thought went into putting the film down on paper. Insight into human behaviour and relationships, a love for the little flourishes of life, and genuine fondness and affection for the characters being written. Yes, some of these moments would be classified as 'filmy'; but they all have one origin - the writer-director's heart. The icing, then, is the cast. Cute-as-a-button Nazriya as Divya charms you. The fact that her husband, known through most of the film as Das, is played by her wonderfully talented real life fiance Fahadh Faasil, gives their story that added zing. Nivin Pauly as Kuttetan has a sweet, bumbling presence. And young Dulquer Salman, who plays Arjun, is a star. The screen presence and confidence is in his genes, of course, but he's also a solid actor - a talent that cannot be taken for granted even if your father is Mammootty.Bangalore Days is one of the most honest films I've seen in a while. The effort put into the film manifests itself in ways that can't strictly be quantified. The film is well shot as well, and has some really nice music. Bangalore, a city that I personally love, is also beautifully captured in the film. It seems so long since we've met characters who we fall in love with and walk with while they fall in love themselves. Bangalore Days offers you just that.]"
85,"[You'd think that somebody would suggest to the guys writing the cheques that sequels to uninspiring, sagging franchises won't quite cut it in the risky business that filmmaking is. Clearly though, nobody has done that yet.A whole battalion of former stars, with some former stars as additions, are back to provide loud bangs, done-to-death action sequences and the occasional smile-worthy lines in a film that the world could have done just as easily without. The Expendables 3 is a film which does have at least a couple of moments that make you not dismiss it as a complete waste of time, but only just.Expectedly, this one too begins with one rather far-fetched action scene, then proceeds to a few more, then finally ends with a long drawn action sequence. The question of what the plot of the film is, then, is moot.It's cute, honestly, how the film attempts to tackle themes like loyalty and love amongst brothers-in-arms; the awkward relationship that men share, when they can't be openly expressive about their genuine love and respect for each other, but how they will put their life on the line when the time calls for it. Too bad that the cynical times we live in means that for a substantial majority of the audience, these ideas belong in cold storage - quite like the men that make up the cast.Even though the all-action-star lineup is well past its sell-by date, they do still have that slight lingering air of glittering machismo that once made the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Wesley Snipes, Jason Statham and Harrison Ford into global superstars. Most of them look awkward on screen now, save for Jason Statham, who is also the only one of the lot who could actually ever act. The most welcome addition to the cast is Mel Gibson, who plays the baddie with unabashed glee; and he also gets the best line in the film.Stallone, who has also been credited with the story and co-credited with screenplay, gets the meatiest role, though I use that term relatively. It is hard to see why anyone must actually be credited with the story here, because it is so merely functional that a couple of jagged cuts with whole lines of dialogue cut out - presumably the censor board's orders - seem to make no difference at all.If there is one reason why it is a tad bit easier to be kinder to an Expendables film, than to, say, Kick or Jai Ho, it is the technical wizardry at their disposal. All of the most far-fetched action scenes merge live-action and CG beautifully, making it easier to suspend one's disbelief. Real-looking ludicrousness is, after all, quite easier to buy than tacky-looking ludicrousness.Hopefully, at least the plight of this film will make the makers see sense and not subject us to a part four. Even if it does, I doubt a review of that film will read any differently than this one.]"
86,"[There is something so exciting and intriguingly gargantuan about the thought of the shared cinematic universe that Kevin Feige and his team at Marvel Studios bring to us every year. It almost seems like an alternate reality, one worth surrendering to.So far, we've been exposed to the top rung of the Marvel line-up, and they've mostly been fun, and have rarely, if ever, been completely disappointing. With James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy, we're introduced to a ragtag bunch of obscure Marvel characters, which was always going to be a risky proposition for the studio. Yet, what is undoubtedly the first of an exciting series of films, does what few expected of it - it is easily the most fun Marvel film since The Avengers. A franchise that could just be the definitive 'Space Western' of this generation, Guardians is thrilling, exciting, inspiring and funny, all in equal measure. The characters are, for want of a better word, a bunch of losers. Individually, their primary concerns are about money or survival. In the larger scheme of things, these concerns seem almost banal. Yet, when these motley characters get together, they become the unlikely eponymous group from the title.More importantly, when they come together, they just seem to have smashing good fun, which rubs off on to the audience. So utterly beautiful it is, the fact that despite the film being set in what feels like the coldest reaches of outer space, our heroes ooze warmth when they're with each other. Not that they're always on friendly terms - but then as they get to know each other better, we get to know them better.Peter Quill, who likes calling himself Star-Lord even if no one else does; the mysterious and slinky assassin Gamora; Rocket the talking raccoon; Groot the humanoid tree; and the sinewy beast Drax; there really couldn't have been a more diverse set of characters thrown into the mix. Their zaniness is perhaps their biggest strength - no one in their right minds would ever take this lot seriously.The plot, like every Marvel film really, is about an evil being, hunting for something that can help him gain power. Here, it's Ronan and Thanos. (The latter, if you remember, made the briefest of appearances in the mid-closing credits scene of The Avengers.) Even though our heroes never quite seem to wrap their heads around it, they are drawn into a bid to foil these evil designs.Yes, there are the impressive set pieces. Yes, the CG and VFX in the film are top notch. But the film primarily works because it is a buddy movie. Our characters are hilarious, and theirs is a coming-of-age tale, with awkward righteousness guiding them in their goal. The dialogues are spontaneously top-notch, and the film has the most dissonant soundtrack one could imagine for a film of this genre, but one that works because of sheer nostalgia. Peter Quill is the only human character in the entire film, so he's obviously the only one for whom music works like magic - evoking memories of a world gone by. Chris Pratt as Quill has a rakish charm about him. Zoe Saldana is fine as Gamora, and it's great to see Dave Bautista actually hold his own as Drax. Perhaps not a victim of a strong previous image like Dwayne Johnson, it is much easier to accept Bautista as an actor. But the most laughs are provided by Rocket and Groot, who are voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel respectively. I've personally always been fascinated by the character of Thanos, so it was good to see Josh Brolin bring him to performance-captured life.Guardians is easily the best studio offering of the summer, and it is a worthy addition to the Marvel line up. Things are only going to get bigger from here, because clearly, they have at least some percentage of a plan.]"
87,"[It is always fun to watch branded films like Singham Returns, whether or not you like the film ultimately. The audience is there to enjoy and I always enjoy their enthusiasm. This once, though there was an additional pleasure. First fifteen minutes into the film, and you know there is a serious attempt at developing a plot. Another half an hour or so in, when you hear one or two people clap and cheer and the rest of the audience joins in you realise that the viewers have been uncharacteristically quiet after the initial zeal. They were hooked to what was happening on screen. Unfortunately, this doesn't last through the film. There are dips, especially in the second half and the climax is a simple bummer.Yet, Singham Returns started with an impact. In fact, it was a pleasant surprise to see subtlety in this form of cinema. There's a remark on an entire generation being responsible for the ""anything goes"" attitude of the current generation, especially with regard to corruption. Then, the ""vote-buying"" scene with the backdrop of a city skyline was a nice touch (even if executed tackily). And a few more alond similar lines.The dialogue writing, especially in the first half is strikingly good. Even if some of it does get ""filmy"", a lot of it is delivered smoothly to appreciate both the dialogue delivery and the dialogue itself. At most times they are unexpectedly contextual, and at times they are even insightful/profound. But, of course, it loses steam in the second half. The writer's passion for showing the hard-working, dutiful facet of the Mumbai police shines through. It's almost as if he takes the offense personally, when people try to bribe a policeman on the street. Not a single policeman is corrupt and they are all up in arms to do the right thing, even if it were at the risk of losing their beloved job. It is almost as if they are an official Union that has gone on strike so that people see the good in them. I'm usually sympathetic towards women's role in films of this genre which have the woman just because there should be a woman, a necessary prop of types. But, while Singham Returns gives Kareena Kapoor more than her share of screen space, the quality her appearance makes you wish it hadn't. She is more like a romantic-cum-comic relief used to elongate the runtime of the film. The romantic track is too long for the theme of the film, is annoying because it is loud and over-done, out-of-place because it doesn't seem to have received the writer's attention when compared to the rest of the film. It felt like a chore that they needed to get out of the way. It is also loud, undoubtedly and unnecessarily. I'd love to see a quieter version of the film without the romance and the comedy for sure.Somewhere on the top of the list of things that make the film loud is Kareena Kapoor. She is shrill and irritating and over-acting. This seems to rub off on other women characters even in the small bits they get like Constable Mahesh's wife and the woman from the slums who supports taking money from a political party for her vote. In comparison, the men seem to be in control. Even the caricature Godman baba that Amol Gupte plays looks mild in comparison, though by himself is over-the-top. Zakir Hussain too is appropriately arrogant and scared as a politician whose career is dependent upon which way the tide flows. In their midst is Ajay Devgn's soothing presence even if he doesn't emote much.  Even so, each one of them has unmissable screen presence, including Ashwini Kalsekar who plays the over-enthusiastic journalist. Setting aside the stretched romantic track and lame attempt at humor, even the action choreography and CGI seems half-hearted this time around. Except for a flying Ajay Devgn once in the entire film, there is no real attempt at adding an element of oomph to the action sequences. As difficult as I find it to believe, the focus is the story and the point its trying to make. That brings me to what some of the regular readers here are waiting to read - It is a Rohit Shetty film, that is a little less like a Rohit Shetty film, because it is actually trying to make sense while trying to keep what one expects from a Rohit Shetty film alive. Fortunately, more of the earlier than latter. ]"
88,"[The one thought that subconsciously remains with you through all of the eight short films in Shuruaat Ka Interval, and which manifests itself into the biggest takeaway from the experience as a whole, is the fact that none of the films were made under the burden of commercial expectations. Each of the filmmakers made the film that they wanted to make. Some of them feel a little raw, yes, and some of them seemed to exist more in minds of the director than as an engaging experience for an audience who doesn't know what is in the filmmaker's mind. Yet, all eight films are perhaps the most honest pieces of filmmaking that you can expect from Indian filmmakers this year. Themed around the word 'interval', each filmmaker interpreted it in their own way, and each of them has come up with starkly different interpretations of the theme.My personal favourite from the anthology was Final Interval, directed by Aarti Bagdi, which is about a person who is the pillar of a family. Despite the film's rather weak performances, it had a very interesting multi-threaded narrative that all came together for a gut-wrenching finish. Another beautiful, somber experience was The Gatekeeper, directed by Atanu Mukherjee. Largely a single character film about a person who mans a railway crossing, the film is beautifully shot, and moves you with the sheer melancholy of the protagonist's life, but also makes you wonder about what it would take to live years and years of the kind of life the gatekeeper lives.Yet another haunting single character piece is Shishir Jha's August, which is basically a question on what constitutes right and wrong. Treated in black-and-white, the film is staid and decently performed, but it often seemed like it deserved a little more exposition, though that is a choice that one can't fault with.A close second favourite for me was Ayan, directed by Amrit Raj Gupta. Perhaps the best acted film amongst the lot, the film takes us backstage at a theatrical performance of Ramayan, where the man playing Ram disappears, leaving the remaining actors and director in the lurch. Hilarious and spontaneous, with rat-a-tat dialogue delivery and some really fine acting, Ayan is genuine fun. Also, being one of only two films from the anthology that can be slotted as true comedies, this one is likely to be the most memorable film of the lot.The other comedy, Interval 3D by Palash Vaswani, has an interesting premise. In the middle of a show of a B-grade horror film, a character from the film gets thrown out from the film and enters the real world, where he meets the audience. This highly intriguing premise, though, is let down by some weak attempts at comedy. Also, the film has been colour-graded far too much - possibly to give it the unreal feel that the plot demands; but it seems far too inorganic, for want of a better word.Krishan Hooda's The Last Audition is more dark comedy than anything else, but it masks the tragedy that the life of a struggling actor in Bombay is. People have only heard about 'struggling actors', but if you visit Bombay and silently observe the thousands of auditions that take place on any given day here, you realize that it is perhaps the most heart-breaking life a person can lead. Beautifully acted by the protagonist, The Last Audition is the most rooted film of the lot.The only film from the set that I found a tad too indulgent in terms of the narrative was Ankit Tripathi's No Exit. The film has an interesting idea at its core - that of memories being the bane of one's existence - but it follows a jagged structure that just doesn't work for the kind of film it aspires to be. It was the one film of the lot that did absolutely nothing for me.Perhaps the most daring, layered and assured film from the anthology is Rukshana Tabassum's Bubbles and Stars. Confusing and beautiful in equal measure, it is - to use a word from the film itself - about 'randomness'. In the interval of a play, the characters (not the actors,) live a little life of their own. Steady black-and-white images that gel well with the interaction between the two zany characters, the film strangely reminded me of a highly sanitized, 50s version of Q's Tasher Desh - though this is probably a highly personal feeling. The film will probably need multiple viewings to thoroughly absorb, but it quite simply was the most intriguing film of the lot.Shuruaat Ka Interval is an inspiration for aspiring filmmakers, and it is a refreshing change for an audience that hasn't been served genuinely honest cinema in what seems like decades. Hopefully, the film will usher in a trend of more theatrical releases for shorts, which can only mean good things for Indian cinema.Note: The ratings given are for the entire experience of the eight short films as an anthology, and will obviously not accurately convey rating of each individual film. ]"
89,"[A couple from deep inside Rajasthan loses all hopes of a livelihood in their village and move to the city of hopes, Mumbai. Given the texture of the film, you know they are going to suffer. A lot. Before they get any respite, if at all. Now, we know where this is going and so have to heavily bank on the details of how this comes about and the performances. One delivers, the other not that much. There's no better way to put this - the difficulties in the lives of Deepak (Rajkummar Rao) and Rakhee (Patralekha) come to easily. Yes, given their value system they are asked to do pretty horrendous things. But, you don't see their resistance. You don't see them looking for better options before stooping low (by their own standards). This is where I lost interest in the film, despite liking the pace at which things were playing out. Then I wondered if it was because Deepak and Rakhee were made out to be generalizations of all immigrants into a city. While some times such stereotypes work, at most times the cliche has to work harder to create an impact. And to that end, Citylights was doing nothing. Every once in a while, it becomes the story of this particular person, Deepak. And at those times, it does engage, but quickly it slips back into being this sad story of how people from outside the city are so gullible and the city is out to get them.I am not going to go into the argument of whether or not all non-city-dwellers are more or less unaware of how the world works and that all city-dwellers are out their to dupe the former. For I believe at some level, we all want to believe that nothing bad will happen to us and when we smarten up it changes to, I'm smarter now, so nothing bad will happen to me. Similarly, all of us will agree to cheat when push comes to shove. The only problem is that you are not convinced that push has come to shove in Deepak and Rakhee's case. The only thing keeping the film interesting then is the performances. Rajkummar Rao and Manav Kaul are thoroughly engaging, especially Manav Kaul. It might have to do more with his character too. The shade of grey, his frustration and reasons for doing what he does are all interesting. Patralekha on the other hand does well with what she's asked to do. How I wish her character had better depth for it to explore her acting skills. Then you have the background score and the songs. They both hinder instead of help. Somehow, the film's ambience isn't congruous with the music. The music by itself is pretty mediocre too. They sounded more like they belonged to a Bhatt film while they were in a setting that wanted to be in the Aamir zone.That I think is the bane. Citylights tries to be two things at the same time for some things that cannot go together. True it keeps the setting real and the performances support that theme. But, other than that, it doesn't engage. Just because a film is morose and grim, it doesn't qualify as one that reaches out to you deep within. It is not good enough to have realistic setting and performances. The story has to make you believe too. That is what Citylights misses. ]"
90,"[It must indeed be a difficult task to make a film with a woman at its center. So difficult are they to write stories around them that the movies have to be padded with a romantic track, a couple of songs and so on. Such a shame. Even so, Bobby Jasoos tries. Not only does it try to make a woman-based story work it tries to highlight how life of women in India is kept from reaching its potential. The question then is, can you watch a movie for an attempt at making a woman-centric film?One of the main reasons people were looking forward to Bobby Jasoos is because its a Vidya Balan product. One of the very few female stars who can command an audience just because of her. While, she doesn't fail as an actor, Bobby aka Bilqis, is hardly challenging enough for her. However, it isn't necessary that she take up projects that only challenge her as an actress. Sometimes it is just the subject that needs attention. And who can deny that attention is necessary for the woman who is suppressed by society, treated as just something that needs to be passed on from father to husband at the right age? This part of the writing is done subtly and is indeed very appealing. Unfortunately though, the rest of the film is spread too thin over too many sub-plots. From lovers who need a detective to ward-off proposals arriving for them through the arranged marriage route by looking for ""flaws"" in the prospective applicant to fathers who can't show their love and care directly to their child to lovers who can't own up to their feelings. The main point of intrigue, the mystery itself has a lame resolution and provides no thrill, even though it tries to tie two main threads of the film together. Top this off with the additional pressure of having to be funny and commercially viable. Yes, commercially viable supposedly = dream sequences, no matter how random and out-of-place they are! I cannot think of another reason for the existence of that song. Oh well.Other than Vidya Balan, Ali Fazal has some brief moments that work well. Arjan Bajwa has a screen presence even if it requires him to hold one expression. The rest of the cast too have their share of screen time which they do well with. None of this is good enough though given how many stories Bobby Jasoos, the film is trying to tell. Each distracting from the other, not letting the other come to its point.]"
91,"[Comparisons with DDLJ and JWM are inevitable. Not that the makers have any qualms about having that comparison made. If only, HSKD had the warmth of DDLJ or the spark of  JWM. Yet, there is some attempt at being different and that's applaudable. Now, HSKD modernises DDLJ with today's lingo and it wouldn't be too far-fetched to say that the average Simran has now grown up to become the average Kavya. To that extent Alia Bhatt's Kavya works. Her adorable demeanor is very difficult to get over and I can imagine people going to the theaters just to watch her and coming out happy.But, she has barely anything to do post-interval. A lot of Aalia's missing over-powering screen presence has to do with Kavya's boyfriend (Humpty, Varun Dhawan) and father (Singh, Ashutosh Rana) taking over the reins of what she wants from life. This is where the film begins to get annoying. This lady, who goes from small-town Ambala to Delhi to organize a Rs. 5,00,000 designer wedding dress, but is willing to do nothing for herself when it matters to her the most? Instead, she's expecting the world to revolve around her despite all else. I understand the film wants to keep things light and I'm thankful they don't go all siren-y melodramatic on us. But, you cannot connect/sympathize with a lead lady just because she's the lead lady, right? What hope is left if she's either full of herself or all chirpy-bubbly when times are desperate. But, Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania scores full points in the one huge complaint I have against films like DDLJ and JWM - the other guy. Unlike its predecessors, HSKD's other guy is not a loser, and is as good as the hero. For all practical purposes, he's well-worth the lead lady (since she's made out to be the prize money). So, there is only one reason to root for our hero. Of course, Humpty is written out to be someone you cannot dislike. But can you root for him? I wasn't too stumped by him. He does all the right things, alright. But, somehow it all seems a little too contrived. Which is why the chemistry between Alia Bhatt and him is less chemistry and more mechanics. I don't think we can find fault with Varun Dhawan's performance. Only thing is, the script just doesn't require much emoting out of him. Siddharth Shukla plays the good boy well. Once again, not much is demanded off him. Ashutosh Rana though is the most charming of the lot. Not as menacing as an Amrish Puri, maybe, but someone you can never be too sure off.The characters' motivations are all over the place and transition from one end to the other without much explanation. Almost as if the writers are banking on the audience's forgiving nature, ""itna toh chalta hai"" (This much ""taking us for granted"" is acceptable). Not much of the other stuff worked - except for one song, the music is bhangra or disco and sounds and looks like the next bhangra or disco number. HSKD is cute. It is certainly DDLJ catching up with today's times. So, it sheds itself of much dramatization and a good part of the run-time. But, it also doesn't stimulate any emotion, let alone touch you from within. ]"
92,"[For about half the film, various characters go about saying, ""I want to kill entertainment,"" Entertainment being the name of a character. But, taking cue from the film's extensive use of pun, you can say that the makers succeeded on that mission statement. There are reasonable attempts at keeping the humor ""different"", but nowhere close to good enough.The film starts out with making fun of obese people and man-boobs. So, you know how sensitive the film is going to be from the word go. Except, that it becomes about love animals and then you know, you should take the film even less seriously than usual. No, not because animal-love is not serious business. But because how can someone who is oblivious to the worthiness of other groups of people - women, for example, be taken seriously when they talk about some other social issue. Even so, the film just might strike a chord amongst animal-lovers just because of the dearth of Hindi films in that category. But, that's just about it. For all other purposes it is like a Moral Science lesson for class 2, the saving grace being it is not an animated film. Not necessarily, preachy, but melo-dramatic enough to turn you off, even before you can let the lesson reach out to you. The evil in you is overturned by the goodness of another, this theme has been beaten down to death in Hindi films. More often than not it comes after a few leaps of faith and more from the audience. Entertainment has almost every character turn over in this manner and is far away from being digestible. Not that that is what the writers were aiming for. Their aim, then, seems to be two-fold. One - to awaken within you, the love for animals and two - to make you laugh. With the first one, I doubt they made any new converts, but I am sure animal-lovers got a lot of ""aawwww"" moments out of it. For a change, I didn't mind the attempt at humor, at some places. Not that it made me laugh too hard, but after exhausting every phrase in which the word dog is used and setting aside a couple of innuendoes, juvenile SMS forwards, toilet jokes and self-referencing puns, there was a genuine attempt at being different. They didn't resort to repeating the same joke over and over again to kill it. Each character was specifically given a certain type of gag-line and there were various analogies, or for want of a better word - verticals that the gag-line took. So, while one character uses names of celebrities instead of words that sound like their name another calls people's bluff when they threaten him using puns related to the threat. As one would expect, this becomes repetitive, but less so than it had potential to.The only thing to be said about the performances is that Tamannaah Bhatia looked the best of the lot. This is despite Sonu Sood and Prakash Raj playing villains. Enough said. Also, the lesser we talk about the plot (complete with logical jumps at regular intervals) though, the better it would be. There is only so much one can say about a father wanting a rich husband for his daughter and the husband-to-be adopting any means to achieve that - including, a competition with a dog, for what the dog owns (yes, ""the dog owns""). I tried to draw various metaphors for the way in which the word Entertainment was used. Unfortunately, the only one that made sense was the one which involved the murder of entertainment.]"
93,"[Here's the thing - I'm unable to take Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson seriously when I watch him on the big screen; and I'm sure loads of people who've known him from his WWE days feel quite the same. Despite his sizeable fan following (which explains why the film opened quite well at the BO) and that he has tried hard to vary his choice of roles, one can't slide away the fact that owing to his muscular physique and affable screen presence, there are only certain kinds of roles he is chosen for, and he's about the same in all of them.Brett Ratner's take on Greek mythology's Hercules is adapted from a graphic novel, and truth be told, Dwayne Johnson sure suits the part. He looks almost superhuman, his sinews appearing capable enough to pull off some of the feats shown in the film.But, all said and done, Hercules is nothing more than VFX-heavy, testosterone-fuelled Hollywood sameness; their version of Kick, if you will.Oh, but there is actually a semblance of a plot in this film. Hercules, now in exile and a mercenary for hire, is brought in to defend the kingdom of Thrace from a mysterious invader. Things get murky, however, even as Hercules battles his own demons.Luckily enough, it doesn't seem like either Rayner or Johnson were taking this film too seriously, at least for the most. There's a bit of humour, loads of action and even more of Johnson playing to the gallery. The portions where it does seem like they were taking themselves seriously are, unsurprisingly, the weakest portions of the film.Mercifully, the film is brisk, and it has at least one twist that flags your interest when you begin to feel the monotony set in. And there's some decently executed close combat action, in addition to the grand battle scenes. Not the gorgeous, uber-stylish kind from 300, but more of the rugged, believable kind.The trick to not getting bored with a film like Hercules, then, is to play along with the lead actor and director, as they dish out a passable film. Don't expect too much, and Hercules at least won't make you regret watching it.]"
94,"[There's a lot of confusion - in the story and in the execution. As is true of many stories that deal with paranormal and mental health, Hum Tum Aur Ghost too, shuttles between the two. Some take sides, some argue it out like a drawing room conversation. Here they don't do either very intentionally. Which is refreshing but in turn they don't get the audience involved in the story either. Unfortunately this is despite trying really hard. Really hard to create sweet moments between Arman and Gehna (Arshad Warsi and Dia Mirza) and friendships between Arman and Mini (Sandhya Mridul) or Arman and Mr. Kapoor (Boman Irani) ; really hard to create comic drama around the mystery surrounding Arman's ""condition""; really hard to make the subject and story interesting. I felt like a pendulum that sways from subtle comedy to serious drama. And the shifts are pretty abrupt. As abrupt as some of the scenes are stuck together - literally looks like the film was randomly chopped and glued together. It was extremely disorienting. The entire cast looks like they have made a good-faith attempt at getting into character. You see romance and sweet nothings being exchanged. They should have brought that ""aawwww"" moments, but no such luck. The emotions look way to superficial. The saving grace though is that some of the comic lines are as subtly slid in as they are funny - very. But they are also very few and quite far between. And the sudden tone shift between funny and display of emotions doesn't help either. Ultimately, the entire film feels like one big trial, a rehearsal for a mediocre show. The confusion in the minds of the makers is way too transparent. Maybe the only situation in which I'd say, I don't want the thoughts of the writer/director to show through to me. ]"
95,"[One always approaches a Wes Anderson film with trepidation. There are expectations, yes; but there are also those lingering fears: Will the bubble burst? Will the new world that you're about to enter enchant like the previous one he created? Will he finally cross the thin line that his indulgent attention to seemingly pointless detail treads? But then, I suppose that's the hallmark of a true visionary - that once you're inside the cinema and the lights dim, everything else fades away, and you're sucked in.The Grand Budapest Hotel is one of the most gorgeous films you can hope to see on the big screen. Beautifully staged, meticulously crafted frames that blend into each other like clockwork (each more captivating than the other), a universe of its own with enticingly flawed characters that inhabit it; all the staple Anderson tropes are there. Yet, he just seems to get better with each film. Set in three different time periods, the longest of which is in pre-World War II Europe, The Grand Budapest Hotel is essentially a caper film - it has robbery, murder, jailbreak, mystery, love, brotherhoods, wills and heirs and everything else that can glue one to their seat. And with the Anderson flourish, it becomes an experience all its own.Ralph Fiennes plays Gustave, a concierge at the titular hotel - a man gifted with words, women and a natural magnetic charm that makes him a leader. Looking at him with wide-eyed awe is an oddly named bell boy Zero. It is their escapades that propel the film, as they battle the likes of a deadly assassin and the Anderson reimagining of the Nazi SS - the ZZ - and we watch a story within a story, gobsmacked at the sheer beauty and craft on display.There's also the subtle humour laced through the film, as characters stop in the middle of the tensest of situations to ponder on something unnecessary (but never irrelevant). In fact, Anderson's penchant for humour is quite unparalleled, as long as you're only looking for the slightest of smiles to remain plastered on your face through the length of the film.But even in his crazed other-world where characters are the kind you've never seen before, they're always written beautifully, rock-solid to the last 'd'. You never once feel that a character behaves in any way that seems out of place for them - and there are plenty of loonies to keep you interested at all times. Even the sinister - almost heartless - aspects of the plot race along merrily with unabashed glee. Here is a filmmaker who can make the pointless murder of a cat seem just a wee bit ticklish. In fact, the manner in which morality is effortlessly reduced to nothing more than a point of view is one of the most interesting aspects of the film, once you've left it behind and are letting the experience sink in.The icing, then, is the cast of the film. While Anderson's staples like Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody and the likes make appearances big and small - and each of them is a delight - the film belongs to Ralph Fiennes and young Tony Revolori who plays Zero. Their timing and spontaneity is impeccable, and they bounce off each other like crazy balls. Special mention must also be made of Willem Defoe's terrifyingly hilarious look in the film - he plays Jopling, the assassin mentioned earlier.Wes Anderson is one of those rare filmmakers whose every indulgence you're willing to forgive, simply because of the loving detail he infuses into his frames, shots, scenes and characters. The Grand Budapest Hotel is yet another feather in his colourful and doubtlessly centre-aligned hat. ]"
96,"[Romcoms by default have a fresh feel about them. They are light and fluffy and are intended to make you smile at the exaggeration. In that way, Amit Sahni Ki List fits the bill perfectly. It also tries to be different in the sense that it's all about this guy who is all set in his life and seems completely focused on finding the perfect woman. His search is built up reasonably well, but doesn't hold interest after a point. A part of it might be because Amit Sahni doesn't quite know what he wants. But then again, who knows what they want? In that sense, it is realistic with Amit rushing towards the side that looks greener. My guess is, this would have been fine had the film been unbiased towards who Amit should pick. The film has clearly picked sides but wants us to believe that Amit is the decision-maker. And this is where the film looks like it has lost its advantage. It has Amit Sahni represent the lost urban youth when it comes to love. That generation which thinks it knows exactly what it wants when it comes to a life partner, but has no clue when push comes to shove, also known as, when they fall in love. The pity is that there is no way the film could've ended right. Whatever Amit Sahni did would've done, it would've been a dissatisfactory call. Fortunately, we have the performances in the right ballpark. Vir Das is aptly charming and confused. Vega Tamotia is her brand of cute and so is her character Mala. Anindita Nayar does the slick, businesswoman bit neatly. Kavi Shastri has the best lines of the lot and has a good comic timing to pull them off too.The film tries its hand at being modern all to be more annoying than trying to connect with the audience. It has Amit Sahni's mom speak in SMS-ese. So she actually talks in abbreviations. Then you have SMS/chat exchanges show up on screen in call bubbles. All very slick but this distracts from the story, rather than blend with the narrative. It all comes across as very overt. For all its modernity, Amit Sahni Ki List does keep the regular traps of relationship films. And it looks like a very deliberate attempt. So, while you do have the couple bond over the regular fun, filmy things, there is something very natural about the way they behave too. Interestingly, they keep sex out of the picture completely. The regular arguments related to friends and career are avoided too. Yet, you don't sense the chemistry except in a couple of scenes. A lot of it has to do with Amit Sahni breaking the fourth wall and talking to us, quite unnecessarily so. Other than that, the songs are not too intrusive. I'd like to talk specially about the opening song. The film is called Amit Sahni Ki List - that is a film which includes the male protagonist's name in its title. It starts with an all woman song that has lyrics that claim that the women are more than just their bodies. But visually, it is like any other item number fully focused on objectifying their sexuality. It is disturbing. This song looked nothing like the trailer, so it was disorienting. I almost wondered if I walked into the wrong screen. Only to find out that it indeed had nothing to do with the film, and unabashedly so. The first line of the film claims that they did it for the producers! I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Off late, I am in a similar conundrum with respect to my overall opinion of a film. I don't like how the film was narrated or how they got to the conclusion or what specifically the conclusion was too. At the same time, story-wise I can't quite tell what would've been a fairly reasonable change they could've made. Maybe even fluffy romcoms, while staying within the realm of exaggeration they are allowed, have started representing life all too well. Maybe that's what doesn't work about these films - they don't take me to a fairyland and neither do they stay real enough for me to identify with them. ]"
97,"[It is that time for the year again, when I go through the futile exercise of reviewing a Salman Khan film. The thing is those who want to watch it, will watch it anyways and you couldn't pay those who don't want to watch it, to do so (why would you want to do that anyway?) Kick is as typical a Salman Khan film as it gets, plus a tad bit of a story, a tad bit of an attempt at keeping things sorted, a tad bit of an attempt at acting more than usual by Salman Khan (not that I was expecting it). He enters in style. He stays, he swaggers and he mouths his sytlish lines in style. No one else matters, though they technically do try and succeed if only the audience cared. I must confess, I think I finally get what the Salmania is all about. The very thing that gets on my nerves - his complete lack of acting skills. Tell me I got this right - he knows that he cannot act and he knows that he can get away with it - this is what makes Salman Khan, Salman Khan. Right? The over-confidence. When I saw him try to emote a little more than usual, even I felt like whistling. No, that's not the magic of Salman Khan. That's the magic of rock-bottom expectations. Oh and listening to him speak in English is refreshing too. It is such a relief not to listen to the lines that you see in the trailer, repeated every 10 minutes to remind us how cool Salman Khan is. In fact, some of the lines are actually enjoyable even if you discount for the fact that the rest of the entire theater is in splits or on a trip of its own cheering in delight, irrespective of what's happening on screen.  They are hooting in joy at anything and everything.Should I then, discount also my joy that the whole theater went into an uproar at Nawazuddin Siddiqui's entry? Even with his short appearance, he leaves a remarkable impression. As a part of his quirky character, he makes this sound every once in a while. It was hilarious to have the audience repeat the sound every time he came on screen. Now, that is audience engagement at a completely different level. Notice, how a lot of the film's experience comes from how the audience reacts to it (even if they have come pre-determined to have a good time). As I sit here, writing this review, I wonder if I'd have given the film any of the few points, if I hadn't seen a 600-seater enjoy it completely. Would I have enjoyed the film for what it is? Nope. Because ultimately, for me the film is about the story and how it is told. And both these bits were highly irksome.Yes, we are back to 'thinking' in a Salman Khan film. How do I stop my brain from working when I see Salman Khan's character, Devi beat the living daylights out of a bunch of people for being onlookers to eve-teasing before he beats the offenders themselves, when in the next sequence he is pretty much stalking a woman? The first half of the film is pretty much that. Devi wooing Shaina, a psychiatrist, one of whose first lines in the film is, ""Mental ho kya?"" (Do you have a mental problem?) No wonder this professional's dad is looking to either provide for her himself or look for a husband who will earn enough for her to live by. I would have tried to make an assessment of the lead lady's performance, but she is so inconsequential, despite having a good hour revolving around her, that it just doesn't matter.In that sense, Kick is actually two stories that is force-fitted to make a feature length film. One is girl-met-boy story, the other a good-vs-evil. So, disconnected are these that they don't even bother mentioning the latter bit in the first half and the former part only happens to be lying around in the good-vs-evil part of the film. The only connecting bit is Randeep Hooda's character, Himanshu Tyagi. He looks good and does his part with the apt amount of smug. Within each story too, there are enough continuity jerks and logical loopholes to make a 1000-word article of its own. When they do try fill us in on the logic, you wish they didn't. So, might as well stick to the aims and objectives of the audience is, ""leave brain behind, whistle and enjoy"", so what a waste of an effort would that be.Other than that, all of Kick feels stilted as if its very aware that it is a Salman Khan film. The songs come in and out in appropriate commercial doses. The cinematography is better than what you would expect from a film of the Salman Khan genre, but that doesn't give the film as a whole, too many bonus points. I didn't like Kick much + the other 599 in the theater loved it (with the two girls by my side, making plans to see it again on Tuesday) = what say, 300 crores? ]"
98,"[Whether or not Fashion is realistic, only a person from inside the fashion industry can tell. It certifies what we can make out from the tabloids. The beauty is that it doesn't even make an attempt to shock. It certainly is a well-told story about the rise and fall of an ambitious woman. And what she learns on the way. The rise might seem fairy-tale like but it is only a set-up for the meat of the story that comes in the last 45 minutes. These 45 minutes take the drama to a high point. Unfortunately these 45 minutes come a little too late. Yes, the post-interval pace and run-time too close to 3 hours are big-time dampeners.So, welcome to the fashion world where women dazzle and men are either gay or sleazeballs or at times both. But none of this is used to sensationalize. It's all stated in a very matter-of-fact, part-of-life manner. In fact, the page-3, prop-dolls are shown as human beings - intelligent, conscious, ambitious, and most important of all, gray human beings. They celebrate success and are supportive in failure. They too have friends who can be called upon in the middle of the night in dire times. Fashionis sprinkled with interesting, thoughtfully written characters with good dialogues. Sure, the weirder stereotypes are chosen. But some of them are so atypical of the actors performing them, that they stand out. To start with there's Meghana (Priyanka Chopra), the aspiring supermodel going through a slow and steady moral breakdown. We've seen Priyanka in quite some high profile movies recently, but this is the first one to actually use her talent and warm facial features. Anisha (Kitu Gidwani) runs a top-line modeling agency that has the knack of taking supermodels through their career cycle, from attitude to arrogance. Kitu plays the perfect shade of gray as the cold yet knowing, beautiful godmother of all successful models.  Harsh Chayya as the arrogant designer, Vinay, who has a strong, almost comical lisp, shows he can actually act if made to. Same goes for Ashwin Mushran, who plays a struggling designer, Rohit and Meghana's compassionate guide in the big bad world of fashion.The only actor who doesn't step out of her comfort zone is Kangna Ranaut, who plays the currently reigning supermodel, Shonali, to perfection. The character is tailor-made for Kangna. She by now has mastered the confused, suicidal woman. So, I still haven't figured out whether her slurred mispronunciations are because of the doped-out characters she plays or it's just her. People wanting to watch the movie for the beautifully stylized women won't be disappointed. The costumes are as drop-dead gorgeous as the women wearing them - both in and out of the fashion shows. Especially noticeable are the colors chosen for Priyanka to match her mood. The make-up from when the women are at home, to the fashion shows, to when they are in despair is absolutely stunning.You are in for a treat if you want some good-looking people perform well. Don't forget that extra ounce of patience to pull you through a few parts of the movie.]"
99,"[For a brief moment there, I thought Lekar Hum Deewana Dil is aiming at something larger, something beyond which noone has suspected it off, something about the urban youth being sensitized to what the interiors of India looks like, even feels like. But, that is a fleeting moment. Other than that, it is a run-down version of a domestic bickering which is as baseless as many a domestic quarrels. Not that fights like these don't make for good stories or even movies. But when you don't empathize with the petty and selfish lady and the smitten boy, there's little hope. I'm all for negative characters as main leads and I like seeing the not-so-nice side of our heroes. But, these just don't inspire any interest.The performances could've been blamed had I gotten over how superficially written the characters were. For a bit, I did consider the possibility that the characters were intentionally made to be so inconsiderate towards the people around them, to portray the apathy of the urban youth. But towards the end, it is difficult to believe that was the intention.The rest of the writing, and movie too is as generic as it could get with hardly any meat in terms of dialogue, supporting roles, music, etc.Lekar Hum Deewana Dil is one of those films for which you can't even say that it could have been better or it had potential. It's more a case of been there, seen too many of those.]"
100,"[There's a serial killer on the loose who kills women ruthlessly and yet I am smiling for the things happening on screen are mildly amusing and hardly scary. With a hero that you hardly care for, a lead lady that is carved out to be too sweet to be true and a villain who hardly has a menacing strain in him, Ek Villain is a revenge saga that works so hard in trying to make you feel for the characters that it fails and you are left gaping at the screen in bewilderment for over two hours.The main culprit is too much backstory. Too much backstory about the lead characters and too much backstory about the villain. Serial killers are serial killers because they are serial killers. They don't really need a reason to be so. I know I have always been a fan of grey characters, but this one just doesn't work here. His reasons are not convincing, and thus only end up being a distraction from his ""villainy"". I was intrigued when the movie started with what looked like the climax. It is very difficult to pull off a thriller when the audience knows a lot of what happens. And difficult it stays, for Ek Villain. There is very little effort put into making the dynamics of how the situation reached the stage of this particular climax interesting. While the movie starts with a bang and a lot happens story-wise too, it reaches a lull soon enough.It is then left to the actors to keep things going. Of the lot, only Siddharth Malhotra with his limited range of expressions came across as closest to natural. Both Shraddha Kapoor and Riteish Deshmukh are trying too hard to be chirpy and villainous respectively, to be effective. You could say they tried to do their bit well, in terms of trying to perform. But cute turned shrill and annoying and villainous actually made me laugh more than once. Yet, I am glad Riteish Deshmukh tried something different from slapstick. Here's to more such attempts. The film is also very loud, in general, with almost one or the other character shouting under the guise of being full of life or full of anger. It doesn't help that the characters are voicing out their thought instead of showing them with action. We know a lot of the villain's characters from their own description of themselves to others, as a monologue.I don't even want to get into the logical gaps in the film. These are clearly things that the makers wanted to take the audience for granted about. Most of them are quick fixes to get from one situation to another. There is this slight sliver of story that might have worked had energies not been spent in making the story non-linear. The story had enough meat, even without the backstories, to make for a decent film. But, it just doesn't work out with the combination of the performances, the side-tracks the story takes, the songs and dances. Quirks like Kamaal R Khan's character are more irritating than anything else, though it does mean he played it well.  Yet, that doesn't make its inclusion an advantage for the film.Saying that this story had potential is giving it a little more credit than it deserves because a lot of it needed to be edited out rather than just changed. We'll continue to wait for a good thriller to come our way. ]"
101,"[You are not expecting intelligent cinema when you walk into a Sajid Khan film. That is a no-brainer. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised as I saw some semblance of a story in the first hour. It made way too much sense (even if in a slapsticky kind of way) for a film that was made by the same person who made Housefull 2. It is insensitive at multiple levels, yet it is borderline ""not as bad as I thought"". And then of course, it goes into one bad sub-plot after another till you are sick and tired of it all. Why did Saif Ali Khan do this one? Is the money that good? Or for that matter Bipasha Basu. Her role is so tiny and most of the time that she's on screen she is relegated to second lead lady. Ram Kapoor is the best of the lot, but that's barely a compliment. Sure, Saif Ali Khan and Riteish Deshmukh do try to contort their faces in ways which made the theater laugh, but that seemed like child's play. Anyway, a change of genre for Riteish Deshmukh is long overdue, I'll hold off comment till Ek Villain. In this one though he does his usual stuff. When the lines are unengaging there is only so much you can do. Interestingly, you'd have thought that the film would rely heavily on one-liners and punch lines to get a laugh out of its audiences. But instead, the ""comedy"" came from the situations rather than a dialogue here or there. I must confess here, that this is my judgment from the way the viewers were reacting rather than my own response. My gut wrenched as the insults got heavier and heavier. I'm not talking about the assault on my intellect. But, about the insensitivity shown towards patients of mental asylums; towards gay people; towards obese people; towards midgets; towards men who dress like women and so on. What is it about these things that makes us laugh? Why is it funny? A mental hospital warden (not even a doctor!) dancing with electrical wires while giving an electrical shock to his patients! Really? That's not humor, that's sad. I understand, that not every thing needs to turn into an outrage and we should know how to laugh at ourselves and so on. And to complete the circle, Sajid Khan cracks a joke at his own film too. But I am not comfortable with poking fun at people's disabilities and/or appearances. Even watching it is not done. I guess I should only be thankful that the film keeps sexual and toilet humor under control. Though there are long scenes involving each one of them which made me cringe. I am not really expecting to enjoy a Sajid Khan film any time soon. But, is a little sensitivity too much to ask for from a filmmaker who has a reasonably wide reach? Does humor have to be at someone else's expense?]"
102,"[Four friends. One girl, three boys. Delhi. Attitude times a few. To top it off, one of them is a cabinet minister's son. They seem to be interested in just having a good time. Given this set-up Fugly actually caught me by surprise when a group of four friends who seemed interested only in having a good time got worked up about social issues - be it eve-teasing or the law and order-politician nexus. It is a shame then, that Fugly doesn't capitalize on the fact that these issues touch the characters' lives personally and ours too. Despite it being so easy to identify with them, we could barely care about what happens to them.The culprit is the paradoxical pace. There is so much going on in the film to the extent that it almost feels like a thriller. Yet, the dramatization, the slow-motions, the extra time spent on elaborating on a scene - kills the film. I am a huge fan of silences and impregnated moments. I love lingering scenes. But, Fugly shows how that can go all wrong when you want to tell the maker, ""Got it, move on already!"" I guess there is a time, a place and a movie for everything.The four lead characters are played by actors who are either too loud or too flat. Amongst the other actors, of course only Jimmy Sheirgill looks like someone we can take seriously. But, then again, he becomes repetitive and predictable. I doubt any of this can be blamed on the actors when the writing is haywire - in screenplay and dialogue. The story by itself is interesting, but it has these irrelevant sub-plots. Almost like, before coming up with the story the writers came up with a list of the issues they wanted to address - eve-teasing, corruption in law and order, hooliganism and ruthlessness in politics, angst of the youth, insensitivity of the media, prositution, gay prostitution, rave parties and so on. They then came up with a story to fit in everything. And that's no way to tell a story, is it?The song and dance sequences further break the jarred flow. They only make matters worse with run-time already stretched beyond patience levels due to some editing/screenplay decisions. Style can add to content, but not this laboured kind of style.I'd still like to believe that Fugly could've been a different film, even better maybe, if they fixed the pace issue. But then again, maybe that would be a different film altogether. ]"
103,"[Who decided that a woman must fight to prove herself worthy of existence? When was it decreed that women are, in any way at all, inferior to men; that their lives mean only to be daughters, wives and mothers? Why is that even today, in a world that has seen humankind create unbelievable miracles - so many of them by women - we still have to 'reserve' places for women in government or in other organizations? Why is it that even urban, educated India has different standards for men and women?I must have been all of 5, maybe less, when I first heard the 'saying' that behind every successful man there is a woman. It rankled back then, and it still does. We've all seen, over the years, how women are the ones blamed for 'degrading  our culture', chastised for 'stepping out of their boundaries', questioned for possessing ambition, and even physically attacked for 'embracing Westernization'. If all of this sickens you, then Nisha Pahuja's documentary, The World Before Her, will hit you in the gut. It hurts like few other films in the recent past.There are two extremes in India - the modern, urban, high-flying but often ugly world of unbridled personal ambition; and the traditional, conservative, fiercely insecure India that guards its past far more than it welcomes the future. The World Before Her juxtaposes the two, with the most objective possible view of the place of women in both worlds. Ruhi is a girl barely out of her teens, from semi-urban India; a girl who aims to make it big at the Miss India pageant. Prachi, on the other hand, is a young instructor at Durga Vahini, the women's wing of Vishwa Hindu Parishad - the self-appointed custodians of Hinduism (or Hindutva, as they'd prefer to call it.)As we take a look at Ruhi's journey - which represents that of so many like her - at the unforgiving, relentless training they have to undergo at beauty pageants, you can't help but feel sorry for the fact that so much of a woman's self-worth is determined by her external appearance. True, there are pageants for men as well, but they rarely ever claim the spotlight the way a beauty pageant for women does. So strange that a society so unashamedly patriarchal finds a competition that pits women against each other on the basis of their looks far more appealing than one for men.Prachi's tale, on the other hand, scares you. Here is a girl who is thankful to her parents for letting her live despite being born a girl, because of which she willingly embraces harsh, physical punishments from her father; a girl who derives an almost perverse pleasure because of her power and domination over the young girls, many of them teenagers, who she trains at the Durga Vahini camps. There are times when these camps almost feel like militant training camps; their acceptance and belief in violence as a solution against the enemies of Hinduism - the big monotheistic religions of the world, Western culture and the likes.Most people will find sympathy in at least one of these faces of India. The ones who fall in the middle, those who feel uncomfortable by the questions that can be asked of both these schools of thought, are the ones who will be most affected by the film. Both these worlds, though starkly different from each other, find parallels in each other as well. Diction expert Sabira Merchant, who trains Miss India contestants on the way they speak during the preparation rounds for the pageant, refers to the pageants as 'factories', which churn out polished, modern Indian women. The Durga Vahini camps are also like factories, spawning hordes of women who can raise fight if the time calls for it. Both worlds have precise routines, specific methods and a rigid structure that participants just can't break free of. While Ruhi, Prachi and the other girls we come across in the film are representative of the journeys that women like them follow, they also become characters we invest in. It is hard to miss the moistening of Ruhi's eyes when she talks about her dream of becoming Miss India and making her parents proud. It is extremely difficult to not view Prachi with a mix of apprehension and sympathy, when she talks about how she hates girls who are too 'girlish'. And do look closely at Ruhi's face and the subtle changes you see in it as the film progresses - you'll see how her Miss India preparation took a biologically-induced toll on her beautifully flawed natural face as well.Interestingly, the documentary is almost crafted like a thriller. It switches between the two worlds smoothly, and as it goes on, you're almost holding your breath, wondering what happens of the women we meet in the film. You wait to see where their respective journeys lead them; and as the two paths merge into each other, you're left stunned, but with nagging questions that will haunt you. Almost like how children, when looking at a television, wonder if they're looking at people in a world inside a box, or if the people inside the box are looking at them and at the world outside.The film restricts itself to the way women are perceived in the two contrasting worlds, but if you think about it, it also questions the two worlds itself. Which is the real India? Is 'Western culture' a threat to our own rich heritage? Or is culture a dynamic and evolving construct that has no option but to change as time passes? How is it that a woman can stand before a massive audience comprised of other women, and fiercely speak of how a woman isn't supposed to think of a 'career'? On the other hand, in the so-called modern, liberal world of the pageants, the women are taught how to stand, walk, talk and twirl. Their legs are supposed to be a certain way, their chins are supposed to be a certain way. Fingers, toes, wrist, neck - everything has a fixed position to project confidence and personality. Doesn't sound so liberal now, does it?Another terrifying thought you take from the film is just how communally charged a country India is. Day-to-day life might seem peaceful, but that there literally are armies being trained by the majority community in the country is scary. It makes you wonder if the minorities have similar notions and ideas. All of this is simmering below a facade of relative harmony. When it will explode is anybody's guess.The World Before Her is the kind of film that you can write and talk about for longer than you can imagine. Hence, it is also an important film; the discomfort which it engenders being a measure of which face you represent, of the ugly world we live in. ]"
104,"[After the initial ""let's get your attention, so you are in your seat"" romantic track, Holiday surprises you with  a decent, thickening plot between an army officer and terrorists. But, as it goes with this genre in Hindi, there are way too many plot holes. And even if you ignore them, there are too many side-tracks in the form of songs and sub-plots to take the film seriously.You have a lead lady (Sonakshi Sinha) who can box, pole vault, play rugby, run, do karate while the lead actor woos her.  In the one song that focuses on her as a character, the main point seems to be Akshay Kumar's dance moves. Come to think of it, I don't think any song has her even lip-syncing. Looks like comic relief ain't enough no more, you need romantic relief. Speaking of which, Govinda is such a misfit and/or waste as comic relief here.These come across as fillers with the intention of selling a product that you are not confident about. Add to the mix, desperate stylisation of the hero and dialogue that doesn't belong. Which is such a shame because despite the gaps in logic and logistics the plot is not half bad.Akshay Kumar fans then might find some respite in the Akshay Kumar-ness of the film. While I have no clue exactly what such a fan looks for, I'd say the actions scenes are cool while they last, though there aren't way too many of them. Hope that helps. On the other hand though, there is hardly any challenge for him from the other side. Both, the villain character and actor are just too dull to make you want to root one way or the other. Thematically too, Holiday tends to get into the preachy zone, almost reprimanding you for not appreciating the efforts of soldiers at the border. Yet, I'd call my 3 hours in the movie hall a success, considering it is nowhere bad to what I expected it to be. Do I give a film extra points for that? Naah. It is just what it is. A casual TV watch if you chance upon it. ]"
105,"[The guilty pleasure of the summer is here. Doug Liman's Edge of Tomorrow is about as much fun as one can have with a sci-fi action flick starring Tom Cruise. Based on a Japanese novel titled 'All You Need is Kill' (which was also the supposed title of the film for a while, before the current name was settled upon), the movie feels like a mash-up of a number of films, including Source Code, Groundhog Day, Starship Troopers, Independence Day and even a little bit of 2013's Oblivion, also starring Cruise.In many ways, this film is also like an equal and opposite mirror image of Oblivion. If that film showed Earth as a vast, beautiful but desolate canvas, with just one man and one woman, Edge of Tomorrow introduces us to Earth as a frenzied and ugly battleground; but again, with one man and one woman at the centre of it all.With its quite relentless pace, some daringly sharp editing, and a terrific lead pair in the form of Cruise and the gorgeous Emily Blunt, Edge of Tomorrow makes for an engaging actioner; one which makes you gloss over its weaknesses because of how smartly it tackles the rather outrageous story at hand. US Army Major William Cage unexpectedly finds himself in the middle of a war in Europe, against an invading alien race, and as he reluctantly goes at it, he ends up in the strangest of predicaments - he is stuck in a time loop, where he wakes up at the exact same point everytime he dies. The only option he has now is to continue living that day over and over again.One of the big question marks raised early in the film is why Cage is made to go to this war at all. It is never fully explained, and it is about the only time in the film you get time to question any of its logic. Once he's in the middle of it, the pace of the film never lets you pause to ask questions. In these time-loop scenarios, one of the biggest worries one faces as an audience is the reason for the time loop occurrence. Luckily, not only is the reason for it in Edge of Tomorrow satisfactory, it is also quite believable in the larger scheme of things. And one of the big, intriguing mysteries of the film, something that no one will ever have the answer to, is how many times does William Cage actually live that day? A hundred time? A thousand times? Even more? We can't tell, and that makes the film so much more enigmatic, because Cage is the only one living that day over and over again. For the rest of the world, at the end of all of it, just one day has passed.The humorous undercurrent throughout the film is a great help, as is some terrifically staged action. Even though some of it can be visually overwhelming and tough to follow (particularly in 3D), the film has an action film heart, and it sticks to it admirably.One does miss a truly impactful and memorable background score, however, which is so important in a film like this. Apart from its rampaging action and sci-fi leanings, the film is also ultimately about unsung heroes and a strange sort of doomed love story. With big-scale films like Edge of Tomorrow, such emotions stay with you much after a film only if it has a powerful music score to go back to. Unfortunately, the film's music is purely functional.Cruise and Blunt, of course, rank among the best things in the film. They react to each other like firecrackers, and it is a pleasure to see a female character in a big action film get so much scope to perform action - almost as much as her co-star. Edge of Tomorrow can be taken to the cleaners if one truly wants to - films in the action sci-fi genra can almost always be torn apart for logic. But sometimes a film is so blatantly honest in its intentions, that you're willing to let it have its way. Edge of Tomorrow is an enjoyable film multiple times over; and I suspect it will make for fun repeat viewing as well.]"
106,"[A coming-of-age film about the protagonist who starts out as a loser, good-for-nothing. Been there, seen that. But Kuku Mathur Ki Jhand Lag Gayi tries its hand at being different. It goes about the ""coming-of-age"" bit in a non-conventional, non-likeable way even. It adds a little zany to it. But, unfortunately in the end, it plummets into the worst kind of run-of-the-mill.Kuku's cousin Prabhakar helps clueless Kuku in a very Bawarchi kind of a way. He just happens to be around to help anyone who needs help in Kuku's family. His means might not be the most honest ones, but get the Mathur family members what they want, they do. Kuku Mathur Ki Jhand Lag Gayi has its share of annoying, loud characters. Their existence seem to be to make the film feature length from a short. The satirical bits of the writing induce some humor. But, they are stretched so long that you wonder if the writers were only being satirical or they really believed in the hocus-pocus shown. The borderline between spoof and using spoof as a medium to show exactly the same thing that you are spoofing. Interestingly, this humbug is where the craziness of the film begins. I am all for quirk in films, but this one gets too literal instead of staying subtle and it comes a bit too late in the film too. Then you are left with the performances. Siddharth Gupta and Amit Sial are the only ones you'd remember after you walk out of the theater. And maybe Pallavi Batra for the loud character she plays annoyingly and aptly. None of this enough to make Kuku Mathur Ki Jhand Lag Gayi a watchable film. And what's with the seemingly profanity in the title? Or maybe I don't want to know. ]"
107,"[Gareth Evans' 2011 flick, The Raid: Redemption, (which was dubbed into English and released worldwide in 2012,) very quickly became a cult action flick. It had some of the best cable-less action you've seen on screen, and had a gritty punch to it that made it a relentless, albeit extremely violent, action entertainer. That film had a threadbare plot, to be honest, but it worked because of just how good the fight scenes were.Evans now takes it a step further, with The Raid 2. The action scenes, in terms of screen-time have been cut down in favour of an actual plot; not one that's particularly novel, if you think about it, but one that makes for an interesting setting for the high octane action you expect from a sequel to The Raid. Think of it as a Yakuza film on crack.Rookie cop Rama from the previous film, (who miraculously made it out of that film alive!) is now convinced to go undercover to infiltrate and help destroy a crime syndicate that has control over the streets of his beloved city. The mafia, of course, has its own politics at play.If you go in expecting to be hooked to the action from the word go, you'll be disappointed; because a lot of time is spent establishing the setting and how Rama works his way in and upwards in the crime organization. Evans had a much higher budget this time round, and it shows. In terms of treatment, the film is quite different from its predecessor - smooth and precise camera movements, a multitude of locations, a nice non-linear editing pattern in certain scenes, and an overall superior production quality. The hardcore action scenes are still there, of course, and they're quite terrific. There is plenty of violent bloodshed, so this film is definitely not for those who aren't fans of raw violence. Apart from the sprinkling it throughout the film, action fans will be satisfied with what they go in to the film for with just one particular car chase scene in the latter half. It is executed with such imagination and raw energy, that it will leave you salivating. What one misses, however, is the threat of Rama's cover blowing. The film concentrates so much on the political machinations at play in the crime world that you never really get a sense of danger about the fact that Rama might be discovered for what he truly is. The story lacks a sense of urgency about it. Adding that to the film could truly have taken it someplace else.Personally speaking, I'd have been more than happy to see even more action in the film, because that's what made The Raid so much fun. Yet, The Raid 2offers enough adrenaline-pumping stuff to keep you hooked, and if you set your expectations right, the plot works as well. Evans has firmly established himself as a genre specialist, and The Raid 3 has already been announced, and will certainly be a film to watch out for.]"
108,"[You roll your eyes as you realise Heropanti is yet another ""love of my life"" vs. ""parental consent"" film. As the parents (read extended family) get more and more vicious your heart sinks because another realisation hits you - this happens in real life, even now. Unfortunately, for Heropanti, real life and decades of films on the topic had desensitized the audience to these issues in the 90s.  With nothing new to say and a hero who wears pink lipstick to the rescue, Heropanti becomes a 2.5 hour long, predictable drone. I think opening titles are an artform by themselves. Besides the creativity that goes into making them, they set the tone of a film. So, it was a huge turn-off when Heropanti had just the two lead actors' and director's names in the opening title. Not because it was short, but doesn't it show conceit? To me, that decision says how little the other team members mattered in the making of the film. I guess a bell should ring when you hear the name Tiger Shroff in a film called, ""Hero""panti and the popular tune from Subhash Ghai's film that shot Jackie Shroff (Tiger Shroff's father, for the uninitiated) to Hero status in the early 80s. Such tactics tell you upfront how strong the makers' confidence on the product itself is. Fair enough, they have tried to inject Hero-ness into Tiger Shroff by giving him some so-bad-that-they-are-good lines - which he delivers with as much style as is possible to make them look more fake and forced than they already are. Then of course, they are repeated so that we can tell that a scene is setup so that the line could be repeated.Surrounded by such superficiality then, it is a miracle, that for a short while you get involved in the drama. You worry that the hero is in a tight spot and that he might get face brutal violence that you don't have the stomach for. That has to be because of the aura created around the villains. Uncharacteristically for the film, Prakash Raj's character, Chaudhary is grey enough to keep you interested. Of course, Prakash Raj, is relatively restrained and has you both worried for the hero and yet, you see yourself sympathizing with him, even if briefly. Unfortunately but not surprisingly, the writers do not capitalize on the emotion that this character evokes. As is expected, the women are pretty tools for the hero and the villain to fight over. Her love for the hero is taken for granted. Her father emotionally blackmails her into believing that she is his property and so on. But then again, that's what women in such situations face in real life. Also, in real life, starlets get a chance to play an action hero with various shades of pink on as lipstick. No, I cannot get over it. At the risk of sounding sexist for wanting to deprive men of cosmetics, such on-the-face make-up is unacceptable even for women. And you cannot escape the distraction for a minute because Tiger Shroff is in almost every scene (after his entry). Not that one was expecting great shakes from a film called Heropanti. But, that the makers, with a 100% fresh starcast don't even attempt to break any mould is disheartening. In fact, they try to milk the popularity of a 20-year old film. Just sad. ]"
109,"[There was a time when it seemed like there were just too many X-Men films coming out. After the original trilogy, the fifth film in the franchise, X-Men: First Class, featured an all-new cast, as it narrated the origin stories of Professor X and Magneto. The film, luckily, breathed some life into the franchise.The seventh film now, (two Wolverine films also appeared along the way,) X-Men: Days of Future Past, brings the cast and characters of the original trilogy as well as those from First Class in a terrific way - with a hooking plot that makes you invest in the X-Men like never before.In a dystopian future, the X-Men are being hunted and killed by machines known as Sentinels, for whom the X-Men are simply no match. Professor X and Magneto come up with an ingenious solution to the Sentinal menace.With the horde of Marvel films coming out lately, it is becoming increasing difficult to make each film stand out. The last of them, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, was a fun film, albeit one that still had too basic a plot. In fact, it is in the stories that films can either stand out or pale away; nothing separates them in terms of scale and execution.With original director Bryan Singer coming back at the helm, Days of Future Past has the thrills and bangs alright, but it is really all about the plot. The time travel aspect, the urgency in the characters' actions, the ambiguity in the motives of characters appearing both in the past and the present - all of it keeps you engaged all along. Even though the film seems to borrow so much from so many films in the recent past - for example, there are more than a few Matrix and Inception deja vu moments sprinkled through the film - the fact remains that set in this X-Men universe with its unique set of characters, it works well. The ensemble cast works even better, because now there are just so many of them. Hugh Jackman has made Wolverine his own, and he's terrific. And there's great joy to be had with the thought of Michael Fassbender and Sir Ian McKellen portraying past and future versions of each other in the same film. Ditto for James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart. Jennifer Lawrence, expectedly in much better shape than in First Class, gets a meaty part and makes it count.One slight disappointment was that there isn't much that stands out in the jaw-dropping set piece department, only because we've seen so much of this already. But do watch out for one incredibly clever scene involving the lightning-fast reflexes of Peter Maximoff (or Quicksilver). With the final tiny post-credits scene, the stage is now set for 2016's X-Men: Apocalypse. Days of Future Past has set the tone for the future nicely. ]"
110,"[If you watch Kochadaiiyaan, before and after the actual film, you'll see snippets of how this film was made - how the cast had to wear special suits meant for performance capture, how they had nothing to react to in terms of their environment and surroundings. It reminds you just how tough filmmaking is. It also inspires awe for actors like Superstar Rajnikanth, who are willing to embrace new technology and go the distance in order to narrate a story that they believe in. Unfortunately, these 'making-of' segments are also the only things truly worth watching in Kochadaiiyaan.The culprit, not surprisingly, is the quality of the animation and visual effects. Stilted human figures, lifeless textures on the environment, unrealistic camera movements, and so many more; Kochadaiiyaan is a thorough visual disappointment. Of course, those comparing this film with the likes of a big Hollywood summer blockbuster must know that the entire budget of Kochadaiiyaan would be a fraction of how much it would cost just to get Hugh Jackman for X-Men: Days of Future Past. Still, that doesn't ease the disappointment.A pity, really, because the story, though not truly out of the ordinary, had enough meat in it to make for a fun watch. Two warring kingdoms battling the ghosts of the past and the threats of the future, as one hero straddles the burdens of history, loss, deception and love. It had all the makings of a bit of a minor epic, to be honest. Unfortunately, apart from the visual let-down, the film also suffers from mediocre music by A. R. Rahman, and a rather placid screenplay. The twists never really grab at you, and you always wait for at least a glimpse of Thalaivar - the real one - he who makes you believe in the impossible; but it never happens. He has a flourish or two here and there, and he also gets to rattle a few dialogues (including some self-referencing I suspect, if you watch the film in Tamil) but you always miss him. Fact is, there's just one of him in flesh and blood, and no amount of technology can change that. Of course, there are so many shots in the film which just couldn't have been executed in live-action - Rajnikanth's entry, for instance. Alas!Soundarya Rajnikanth Ashwin must surely be lauded for the brave attempt, but Kochadaiiyaan deserved to either be as good as the best performance-capture animated film ever, or it deserved to have not been made at all. This technically shoddy film that has come out of the attempt does justice to neither Thalaivar nor his fans. And what they've made of gorgeous Deepika Padukone's face added travesty. That is the sad truth of it. ]"
111,"[When you walk into a film called ""The Xpose"" and you know the word will stand for both skin-show and a big reveal equally, you aren't really walking in with too many expectations. I actually look forward to a line or two that will entertain/engage or at the very least amuse me. No such luck.Oh wait, Himesh Reshammiya's character Ravi is so obnoxious that it is amusing, till he gets annoying. But, till then, I was in awe of the person who thought of such an arrogant style for the protagonist. So, I am not rooting for the character, who is supposedly mean for the good. I don't care who he falls in love with and what he is willing to do for her. Considering it is a murder mystery, you'd think you are made to care about the victim. But, you are asked, neigh begged, to judge her negatively from the first frame she shows up in. And when the big ""expose"" happens, you don't care either. Sure, the writer has tried hard to make it a huge reveal, but it just doesn't matter enough. In addition, it goes overboard in increasing the tension. Yes, additional drama in terms of slo-mo scenes and dramatic background score. But, also story-wise it goes says more than once, ""not over yet, there's more.""The performances are as perfunctory as they can get. To rub salt into the wound, you have Irrfan Khan doing a voiceover. The setting of the 70s doesn't work at all. The songs, well has either, Yo Yo Honey Singh or Himesh Reshammiya as their singer. So, there's no looking for respite there. The sliver lining is - it is a short film. And that it has come out on a day where people are generally, likely to care about it even less than usual - let alone read its review. ]"
112,"[Last year, we saw the Jaegers and Kaiju battle it out for big screen giant supremacy, in Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim. While we know how that fun war panned out, perhaps it wouldn't be wrong to say that Godzilla still remains the grand-daddy of all big screen mega-creatures.Six decades after Godzilla's first big screen appearance, maverick director Gareth Edwards gives us a fun retelling of the Godzilla legend; his film is far more fun than the last Hollywood Godzilla film, the 1998 one directed by Roland Emmerich. What makes it fun is the fact that the film is also a strange sort of superhero film; yes, you read that right.Watch this one right from the first frame, because the cleverly designed opening credits lay the groundwork for the story of the film, before we launch into the real thing. Unexplained earthquakes, a devastated nuclear plant; and things get mysterious as an American engineer in Japan begins fearing that something far more dangerous is the cause for it. 15 years later, the world gets to see just what the cause of the tremors was... Set initially in Japan before moving to San Francisco for the finale, the film takes its time to build, and one of the best things about the film is that the monsters aren't overused. They make their appearance late, and are never properly revealed to the audience right through the film. While that automatically conveys a sense of massive scale, it also makes each appearance of every monster an event, making the film almost always interesting, because you don't quite know what gigantic bit of action is going to take place next.But what I truly loved about this Godzilla reboot is just how much it draws from 'monster master' Ishiro Honda's 1954 film. (Remember, the dedication in the very last frame of the end credits of Pacific Rim?) When Godzilla made his first appearance in 1954 it was essentially a metaphor for the horrors that Japan faced by being the first victims of a nuclear bomb. Godzilla stood for the ills of nuclear power, and that thought is carried forward in this film, right through to the connection with Japan. Godzilla's iconic wail and his hulking shape look better than ever before, and you almost cheer every appearance of his. The film is beautifully shot - very atmospheric and moody. However, it would have ideally been enjoyed best in 2D, because the 3D doesn't add much, and the glasses obviously make the dark images even darker. What's also nice is that the film isn't merely about monsters and booms. There's a story and there are characters with a personal stake as well. In fact, a lot of time is actually spent making us invest in these characters, so that we aren't just rooting for nameless and faceless crowds of people. It unfolds at a leisurely pace initially, but it doesn't bother you at all, because of its crisp runtime. In fact, it adds nicely to the sense of tension, as you're waiting for the epic battles that the film is ultimately about. Strangely enough, with this film, you feel a far more personal connect with Godzilla than you've ever felt. And Godzilla reminds you, once again, that heroes come in all shapes and sizes.]"
113,"[Children of War is what I'd like to call an over-directed film. Beautifully shot to a fault, and dealing with one of the most tragic but oft-forgotten chapters in the history of our subcontinent, Mrityunjay Devvrat's film is a devastating look at Bangladesh's struggle for independence, in the wake of then West Pakistan's Operation Searchlight - a systematic attempt to subdue the call for East Pakistan's independence by resorting to cold-blooded mass murder.There is much to appreciate in the film, no doubt about that. The story of the film is important, and its intent cannot be questioned at all. But, in spite of being a fictionalized account, the film is too focused on atmosphere and recreating the sheer extent of the tragedy, than in any real storytelling; this, despite the fact that the film follows three different stories intermittently.There's the story of the journalist whose life is thrown out of gear when he is violently and unexpectedly separated from his wife; then there's a pair of young siblings orphaned by war; and finally there is one smaller thread where a young Bangladeshi man attempts to keep the flame of revolution alive through an impassioned speech. The stories and characters, however, play second fiddle to continuously occurring scenes of torture, suffering and oppression of innocent Bangladeshi's by the Pakistani army. There are long montages of bodies, blood and death. Each of these is beautifully shot and hit you in the gut; but there's just too much of it happening.Everything in the film, in fact, is in excess. The background score is almost always heavy. The performances, even by stalwarts like Victor Banerjee, Pawan Malhotra and the late Farooque Shaikh saab, are far too theatrical. Too many pauses, too much drama. And yet, the story moves along at too slow a pace. At 162 minutes, this makes the film at least 30 minutes longer than it deserved to be.The film hurts you; it makes you wish that humankind had the sense to see that to be human is to show compassion. Thousands and thousands of babies were born of the rapes of Bangladeshi women during those tragic months in the lead up to surrender of Pakistani troops, and the film makes you see that such large scale human suffering could so easily be avoided if we let our instinct for compassion overrule our lust for power.Yet, Children of War seems like a lost opportunity. The film could have risen so much more if it had let the characters and their story speak more than just the beautifully grotesque imagery. In fact, one can't help but wonder if the objective was to glorify the gut-wrenching suffering in any way. You'll know what I'm talking about, when you see this really lengthy shot of a crying toddler amidst blood-soaked corpses, one of them presumably of his mother, and the camera lingers long enough for you to start wondering what the child made to shoot the scene would have experienced, in exchange for the viewer being reinforced with a point that is made throughout the film anyway.Another personal peeve for me was how the language of the film is primarily Hindi, even though the language of the characters is obviously not. It would have seemed so much more authentic to have them speak Bengali instead. Children of War, then, is a film that misses out on being truly memorable, because it tries to visually rub in memories of a tragedy, rather than let us identify with characters who lived it. It is a brave film, and definitely one that stands apart from what we're subjected to on most Fridays, but it is also one that deserved to be so much more.]"
114,"[Hindi war films are a rarity. Well-made ones even more so. Kya Dilli Kya Lahore is a welcome change just for that. To top it off it is a more-or-less two man act and yet, manages to engage you through the 100-minute run-time.Both sides of a dusty, rugged section of the India-Pakistan border find themselves with one soldier each. Interestingly, both the soldiers belonged to the other side before partition. It is easy to understand why their allegiance is confused. You empathize that they are put in such a situation at all. You, in fact, find yourself changing sides for both seem like protagonists and you could take either side as the film moves from one mini-event to another. Kya Dilli Kya Lahore doesn't move much. Not only in its physical space or the time (it is set over a period of about 24 hours), but also in terms of what actually happens in the film. The movement is in emotions rather than events. This gives the film fluidity which feels so different from the episodic nature of many a Hindi film. Given these circumstances, the film does run the risk of becoming repetitive. After all, there are only so many ways in which an Indian and a Pakistani (even if they are newly so) can sling mud at each other. Unfortunately, Kya Dilli Kya Lahore does fall prey to that. But, the pace is such that it gets itself out soon enough.Also, characters go through a back and forth in emotions which is believable but could have very easily gotten iterative, but for the brilliant performances by Vijay Raaz and Manu Rishi. From the word go their act seems so effortless and natural that you take it for granted. I caught myself thinking of it as a performance only when I deliberately focused on it. Till then and immediately after it was a given. Kya Dilli Kya Lahore is not only well-shot, but is also almost background score less - which again is a rarity in Hindi cinema. With only frog croaks and the sound of the wind in the background at many times, when the songs blare (most likely to break monotony) it is jarring. Other than that, the film brings about the vanity of war and the impact of macro level decisions made by politicians on the common man soldier just about well - with a tinge of dark comedy too. It could be called cliche too, but every once in a while cliche works. The last Hindi war film we saw was, War Chhod Na Yaar and it was well, not too good. Kya Dilli Kya Lahore is not only well-intentioned it is well made too. Certainly worth the 100 minutes. ]"
115,"[Despite a borderline cheesy trailer, Revolver Rani - the name, the supposedly women-centric theme and post-Queen Kangna Ranaut make you believe that this film has potential to be a winner. Interestingly enough the cheesiness in the trailer is actually borderline enjoyable quirkiness; the women-centric theme is ""supposedly"" at the end of it all and Kangna Ranaut does a fantastic job of bringing the zaniness alive. However, the disappointment with how the ""woman-centric"" bit of the story plays out takes away everything from what is or could be appreciable about the film. Despite the spoofiness and the goofiness of it all, I just couldn't believe that was how it was panning out for her, our Revolver Rani. On the other hand, Kangna Raut makes every bit of the crazy Revolver Rani (aka Alka) as believable as enjoyable. Yes, she's over-the-top but in a good way. Now, that's something I'd say very rarely about an OTT performance. Sure, there are places where she loses it and certainly it is one of those performances where the labor shows. But, I must say after Queen I give the lady extra points for just trying. She does lose her steam in some scenes. But, it is unfair to blame it all on her.The writing itself loses steam and becomes repetitive once too often. The second half tries to bring sense to the plot which is a disservice to the hilarity of it all. It doesn't help that other than Revolver Rani, none of the characters get any attention from the writers. They are all rather plain and painfully predictable. The one thing that is consistent and would have been beautiful if it were paid a little more attention to is the background score. It is so asynchronous to the visuals that it adds a layer to the eccentricity.Revolver Rani makes you feel it had the potential to be an enjoyable, out-of-the-box film. But, I doubt, with that second half there was any possible redemption.]"
116,"[Wait, another Spiderman film is back already? Well, yes it is. The sequel to the reboot of the adaptation is in theatres, and it is as winded as this sentence. When the fortuitously named Marc Webb helmed the first film of this series, one felt that Spidey was in safe hands. With this film, you won't change your mind just yet, but no one will judge you if you pause for a quick rethink. Heavy on romance, pauses and nothingness, but also sprinkled with some amount of action (not to mention tongue-in-cheek humour), The Amazing Spiderman 2 continues in the same vein as its predecessor, which essentially means that it will entertain a few, bore some others, and leave the rest waiting for the next big Marvel film (X-Men: Days of Future Past, which is just around the corner!)Interestingly enough, that firecracker of a lady, Emma Stone, is the best thing about this enterprise, as she lights up the screen with her Gwen Stacy everytime she shows up. She more than makes up for a rather rough-around-the-edges Andrew Garfield, who seems in his element only in the Spandex Spidey suit, where you can't see him emote anyway. In fact, considering how much time Marc Webb spends on the Gwen-Peter romance in this film, you almost wonder if he was making a film called, say, 500 Days of Gwen.That isn't to say that the romance isn't sweet; it quite is. Still, you spend way too much time waiting for Electro (and the Green Goblin; and Rhino) to show up, and when they do, you're served with action that isn't quite as imaginative as you'd have hoped. True, Spiderman has clearly gotten the hang of webslinging now that he's into his second film, but you can't just resort to showing cars stopping mid-air just above an innocent victim's head all the time.Electro's backstory is treated with kindergarten naivete, and is another subplot that is devoted longer screen time than it deserved. When he does eventually show up, he does the bright and shiny things you expect him to do, set to an unusually screeching background score. The action set-pieces between him and Spiderman are more fun for the chemistry between the characters, than for any actual brilliance in execution.What you're left with are a few periodic smart-ass one liners from Spiderman, and a gut-wrenching climax; albeit one which fans of the Spiderman comics would have been expecting anyway. Expectedly, tantalising hints about the villains in future films are present in this one.What it boils down to, then, is this: Like the first film, this one too has Spiderman play out a scene with a little boy. The point of these scenes, I suppose, is to bring out the hope that Spiderman instills into the hearts of those who believe. It is that hope that will have people waiting for the next film with equal eagerness. There isn't much of that hope that this current film can stake claim over, though.]"
117,"[Subhash Ghai must first fire his casting director. Then he must think long and hard about whether he has anything truly worthwhile to say through his cinema. And then he must think about whether he has what it takes to say it.Kaanchi, his self-proclaimed magnum opus, is an abomination of a film, despite having its heart in the right place. Sure, it's a good sign when a big commercial director makes a big commercial film with the whole thrust on the leading lady, a debutante at that. It is great to see that the point of the leading lady of the film isn't to ultimately end up with some man. And of course, it is always good to see an actor like Chandan Roy Sanyal let himself loose and have a good time.But neither does Ghai's latest discovery, a young girl named Mishti, have the acting chops to pull off the role she plays, nor does anyone apart from Chandan Roy Sanyal do anything that comes across as much better than the sound of screeching nails on a blackboard - and that includes fine actors like Rishi Kapoor and Mithun Chakraborty - who're made to look like clowns and caricatures.The film attempts to show the power of a woman with will; it attempts to show how our country has always been held back by the corrupt men in power; it is pretty much a David versus Goliath tale, where David is a woman. As I said, the film is certainly well-intentioned.Set in a small hamlet in the hills in the first half and in the big bad urban world in the second, the film follows innocent young Kaanchi as she suffers and then fights against those who were responsible for her misery. But shoddy writing - always a problem with Ghai's films - quite simply makes the film an ordeal to sit through; its monstrous runtime adding to the viewer's woes. Subhash Ghai comes across as an old-timer trying his best to tell a contemporary tale. His language is clearly of the days gone by, even if his story attempts to be contemporary. You see this instantly, when you have the leader of a young political party that wishes to take on the system, stand on stage and sing a part-rock, part-masala song with lyrics that sound like 'Jai Ho' (or Jaya He, perhaps).And with Kaanchi reacting in unlikely ways to unlikely scenarios, you can't help ask yourself just what Ghai was thinking. You never quite feel for her, because everything comes across as too made up, too easy. Kaanchi's struggle should make you weep for her. Instead, you wonder how a little village belle manages to outsmart so many rich and powerful people with ease; essentially it is a screenplay with far too many leaps of faith for you to take it seriously.As the film drags on and on until you've had enough, you almost feel thankful to see the end credits. You also wonder why this thought hasn't yet crossed Subhash Ghai's mind: ""Even Sachin Tendulkar has retired. What am I still doing?""]"
118,"[*I am out on a vacation. Pradeep has been kind enough to review the film for wogma. So here goes...  ~ meetu* ----------------------------------------------2 States is the kind of film that is most likely to give you exactly what you expect from it; and that isn't necessarily a good thing.A young, vibrant love story between a Punjabi boy and a Tamilian girl - or, as we Indians seem to revel in relegating to highly generic region-based nomenclature as 'North Indian' and 'South Indian' (for the record, 'North India' and 'South India' are not places!) - 2 States gives you a thoroughly engaging lead pair amidst stereotypical humour taking off on the respective states. (The showy Punjabi or the condescending Tamilian, for instance.)That the attractive leads are going to fall in love with each other is a given. Arjun Kapoor and Alia Bhatt occupy the screen as well as their young, yuppie characters with ease. They play off each other well; to use a cliche that should have been abolished even before slavery was, they share 'great chemistry'. What is also nice to see is the easy manner in which the couple - both the boy as well as the girl - handles intimacy, without it being made as big a deal as we're used to seeing in our movies. In fact, the scenes featuring just the couple are rather refreshing. In the context of our big mainstream cinema, this is the closest we've come to capturing the spirit of how the youth of today treat relationships.But in India, love is the mere beginning. The hard part is convincing the respective sets of parents, particularly when it so happens that they lie on opposite sides of the great cultural divide brought forth by the mighty Vindhyas.In terms of plot, the film stays largely faithful to the Chetan Bhagat novel it is adapted from. One can safely say that 2 States isn't Bhagat's worst bit of writing, though that isn't particularly saying much. Where the film falters, despite being largely watchable, is precisely where it should actually have been the strongest - in the conflict that prevents the couple in love from ending up together. If the romance portions are breezy and make you smile often, the portions involving the parents look like they belong to another film, one that was set a few decades back. True, the Punjabi-Tamil (or, North-South, if you prefer it) clash is meant to evoke comedy, but it comes across as too forced. It's hard to digest the kind of acrimony seen in the film in this day and age, even though the reluctance of the older generation is still very much a reality. Another sore point in the film is the relationship that Arjun's character Krish shares with his father played by a suitably gruff Ronit Roy. It keeps cropping up through the film, but is never once fully explained.The film is also sinfully long. At two and a half hours, considering the demographic the film is aimed at, the film is a good thirty minutes too long. The climax of the film drags on and on, and then drags some more, before ending exactly where you knew it was going to end. The film also follows a forced non-linear narrative that just doesn't seem to have a point. Why it moves back and forth in time is a mystery, when it would have worked just the same as a flat-out linear narrative.The real takeaway from the film, then, is the manner in which the supporting cast, the four parents to be precise, create characters that are at once over-the-top yet believable. Revathy and Amrita Singh, in particular, are top notch. While Arjun is earnest and Alia brings spunk, verve and spontaneity to her part, they aren't faced with the task of creating distinct characters, the way the senior actors are. It would have helped immensely if the film had a more memorable soundtrack, though a couple of songs are quite catchy, to be fair. When you walk out of 2 States, then, one isn't likely to be absolutely gushing about it, nor will one be particularly annoyed by it. It just gives you what it promises - tolerable enough fun for just as long as it lasts.]"

So here goes...  ~ meetu* ----------------------------------------------It is election season, so obviously Hindi cinema can't be expected to not cash in on the fervour. Bhoothnath, the ghost who failed miserably in attempting to scare the bollocks out of little Banku is back. This time, he has another kid for company, and this time, he's taking on the establishment.Watching Amitabh Bachchan taking on the system has historically always been fun. This time though, he's doing it a little tongue-in-cheek, without landing any of those fearsome kicks that have left many a backside sore. Nitesh Tiwari, co-director of Chillar Party, gives us a film that easily surpasses the first one.Bhoothnath Returns has its heart in the right place. After his escapades from the first film, Bhoothnath makes his way to some sort of ghost headquarters, known as Bhoothworld, where he is a laughing stock for being a ghost who couldn't scare even a little child. (Presumably every country has its own Bhoothworld, because in the land shown in the film, every ghost is Indian.) Bhoothnath then returns to Earth to make amends, where he gets sucked into a political battle with a crafty politician.The film is quite funny in spurts, in a really sweet, genuine way. The humour is clean, and at times it is so innocent that you can't help a smile or a chuckle, even if you aren't actually tickled by the jokes. For example, keep a look out for all the signboards in Bhoothworld - they remind you of a time when there was no intent to be extra-smart in cinema, just the wish to make an understated point.The real story of the film begins when our ghost decides that he wants to stand for elections. Now the thing is, if you aren't able to wrap your head around this unlikely premise, then there's no chance at all that you'll even want to see the point that the film is attempting to make. There are certain films where one just must suspend their disbelief, and this film is one of those.Because really, the film has an important message for us all - the fact that it is important to be an active participant in the democratic process, that it is important to take the onus of selecting your candidate, if you don't want a candidate thrust down your throat. It's good to see that the film takes on the more general problems that one would face with a corrupt politician in power, rather than equating him to any of our real life elected villains.Amitabh Bachchan also shares a warm camaraderie with a little boy who goes by the unusual name 'Akhrot', which means walnut. Played with spunk by child actor Parth, he's essentially the soul of the film. In fact, despite terrific performances by Mr. Bachchan and Boman Irani as the politician Bhau, it is little Akhrot's character that propels the film in the directions it chooses. After all, the little children of today are the future. They're the ones who'll be more affected by the choices we make today. The film also has a host of good character actors in smaller roles, who appear one after the other through the film. Brijendra Kala and Sanjay Mishra - both of whom were last seen in Ankhon Dekhi - are quite outstanding. Watch out also for a couple of superstar cameos, and for one scene involving a well known Indian film director who plays himself.The thing is, if the average Indian wasn't gullible or apathetic, then one could have made a serious film that tackles the message that Bhoothnath Returns does. The film is a little too preachy, a little too naive at times. Essentially it is a film that would work well to educate children on the importance of the citizen in democracy. Unfortunately, it seems that is also the only way to educate adults as well.Another time, another place, one would say that while Bhoothnath Returns is better than its predecessor, it isn't particularly a must-watch by itself. This election season, however, one can't help wonder that, even though Bhoothnath Returns isn't nearly the political film we deserve, it is perhaps the one we need right now. ]"
120,"[Wally Pfister - Christopher Nolan's long time collaborator as cinematographer - makes his directorial debut with Transcendence, and the first word that comes to my mind to describe this first film he gives us, is 'strange'. Transcendence instantly slots itself into the sci-fi space. But the sci-fi element is mostly relegated to the background. While one can't say that it has been dumbed down per se, it just exists like gentle fumes behind more philosophical and moral themes that the film talks about - about the dangers of fusing technology with human thought, and to what limits a humanity can go to, once such powers are in our hands.It is also a human drama of sorts. Except, there is nothing dramatic about the film. It doesn't particularly have a graph or a journey for the characters - at least not in the usual cinematic sense of an arc. Then of course, it is a thriller. Yet again, though, it is a thriller that doesn't thrill outright. It doesn't have peaks and moments that leap out to shock you. It makes do with just a sense of foreboding - making you wait for something to happen; that something never really happens. It expects you to be content with the journey, not the destination.Lastly, it is also a strange sort of romance - where the lead pair hardly ever spends screen time together, and the love they share transcends everything that we've come to accept as 'normal'. This, I suspect, is one of the reasons behind the film's title, though there is also another reason that is given in the film.Transcendence is about an extraordinary researcher named Will Caster, who is on the cusp of taking artificial intelligence into uncharted realms. However, a fringe group of activists is against empowering machines so much. The clash between these two streams of thought eventually leads Caster on to something much bigger than anyone ever hoped; and then Will and his wife Evelyn are separated in a manner they never even dreamed of.It is interesting, the manner in which Pfister treats his film. An old school man, Pfister shoots his film lovingly, on film. The grainy look hardly ever betrays that the film is actually about high end, ultra radical technology - a strange sort of paradox. He is in no hurry to tell his story, so the pace of the film never ever picks up. It just unfolds slowly, and then it ends.He uses extreme close ups, a number of them abstract, to slow the film further. There are times when it seems like an effort to actually alienate the audience from the film, and in that, the film succeeds quite often - Transcendence is unlikely to win too many fans, because, very crudely put, nothing much happens in the film.Nothing in the film is outright impressive at any level - be it in terms of the plot, the treatment or even the technique. (One audience member even called the film 'boring'.) The audience can't quite be faulted here, because one can see that Pfister had no intention of impressing the audience ever.Transcendence is slow poison. Neither does it force the audience to think about the questions it raises, nor does it try to blow their mind with the character of Will Caster and where he ends up. With its unusually staid pace, you end up forgetting the important moral implications of the power of human intellect, which the film holds at its core. It is this core of the film, however, that needs one to take an earnest initiative to truly understand. The film, essentially, has no body. It does, however, have a soul. And souls, we've come to believe, live forever. I suspect, then, that it is the sort of film that, in time, will find an audience. The audience of today though, I'm sure, is likely to reject the film.]"
121,"[Heartbreaker's premise sounded like it was another offshoot of Ladies vs Ricky Bahl. In French. I instantly knew I had to go see this film, especially since in India only more serious French movies get released (if at all). It was almost a field day for the romantic in me, to be able to see a French rom-com. And even though it's a predictable, structured film - Romain Duris (of Russian Dolls and The Beat That My Heart Skipped fame) pulls the film through. Alex (Duris), along with his sister and her husband (Julie Ferrier and Francois Damiens) have a unique business - they breakup marriages/relationships. The opening scene of the film steals you; set in Morocco it's a crisp entertaining 15 minutes describing Alex's craft with women. He's the typical rom-com anti-hero-who-becomes-the-hero, one who claims to never fall in love, especially with his clients. And you find yourself wanting to believe him, which is pretty admirable for a film of this genre. Alex's method is simple. He convinces rather vulnerable targets that their partners are just not right for them, by charming the woman's pants off, except that he keeps it professional. This makes for a witty and fascinating quarter of the film. It goes downhill the minute he meets, what the trailers refer to as ""his match"" i.e. the girl capable of making him fall in love. Currently in Monaco, he gets an assignment to break up the upcoming marriage of wine connoisseur Juliette (Vanessa Paradis) - this also being the only French ingredient in Heartbreaker, as everything else (structure, formulas, clothing, background music and the subtitled dialogues) is wannabe Hollywood. So much so that even Juliette's best friend Sophie (Helen Noguerra) is a sex fiend who magically makes Juliette look classy. Typical. The only salvage is Paradis' looks like an elegant, aristocratic sweetheart - an image that  comes through by virtue of her friend's behaviour, but it works with her appearance.    Alex enters Juliette's life as her bodyguard. And even though he seems reluctant at first to break up a wedding that is due in 10 days, he is forced because of his financial desperation - a lagging, unnecessary subplot involving irrelevant goons and thugs. The rest of the movie becomes like a liability; one that you are forced to watch because you were not given an option in the beginning. You simply had to fall in love with Alex, and curse yourself as he predictably falls in love with Juliette. Heartbreaker is a good-looking movie, but it's one that tries too hard. The subtitles are timed and you don't get the feeling that it's a language that you might not understand. Halfway through Heartbreaker, it's like the makers forgot to add an ounce of charm. The plot then starts beginning to feel heavy - and the background music a little too mushy. I'm surprised no American studio has bought the rights yet. All praise to Romain Duris, though, who is an absolute charmer and brings the movie to a watchable slate. Maybe on a cold winter afternoon with your girlfriends. ]"
122,"[If you look closely, you will find a tiny line and half a scene which involves Main Tera Hero's hero, Seenu (Varun Dhawan) being an actual hero - when he empowers Sunaina (Ileana D'cruz) to stand up for herself. A couple other tiny needles I found in the haystack is a couple of glimpses of great comic timing by Ileana D'Cruz, Saurabh Shukla and Arunoday Singh. That is all there is to Main Tera Hero. The rest is, the film fooling itself into believing that it is funny under the garb of mindless comedy.However, what Main Tera Hero makes no pretensions about is that it has no interest in taking anything seriously. So, we have Seenu move randomly from a small town to Bangalore and take on a mean cop (Arunoday Singh) who is obsessed and manically possessive about the girl he is in love with, Sunaina (Ileana D'Cruz), who of course our man Seenu falls in love with at first sight. Only that we have a twist that comes conveniently at half-mark, when you have stopped caring a long time ago. Yeah, Main Tera Hoon is that kind of a film.I would have complained about how the women are at the mercy of the silly games the men play in this game, but then I should know not to do that right from the title of the film.The attempt at comedy is really laughable - most certainly, not in a good way. Its the same old tricks you would have found in a David Dhawan film a couple of decades ago - the slaps, the contrived situations which get worse by the minute. You hit your palm on your forehead and stop yourself from wondering who comes up with stuff like this. Yet, I must admit that Main Tera Hero has much more focus in its plot than an average David Dhawan film.  So much so that, Shakti Kapoor's subplot seems like an afterthought - oops, we are too focused on the central plot by our own standards. That or they thought the film was falling short in terms of runtime. Either case, what an eyesore. The performances are those that belong in a slapstick film. Varun Dhawan monkeys around, Nargis Fakhri adequately continues to annoy, and Anupam Kher makes a fool of himself yet again. Like I said earlier, Ileana D'Cruz, Saurabh Shukla and Arunoday Singh manage a laugh or two, but just about. What boggles my mind is - the 8.30AM show was a full house and so seemed the next one as I walked out after the film. What is as cute as it is despairing is that there was a group in the cinema hall which was laughing out loud and having fun. Sometimes, I wish I could just do that. ]"
123,"[Deep friendships. Friends that take advantage of you. We all have at least a couple of both types. Rangrezz makes a  brave effort at showing you both the sides unlike what you are used to seeing in Bollywood. Unfortunately, it slacks of at times and takes the easier beaten-down route to redeem itself a little later - leading to a very uneven second half and an extremely dissatisfying conclusion.Rangrezz starts off with a collage of beautiful Mumbai monsoons in a heavily grey, tone pretty much resembling Mumbai what it looks like in the season. My surprise began with those initial shots. A little later when the colors and unwarranted close-ups come in, I was back to being comfortable because the movie began looking like what I had expected. And yet again, I was pleasantly being pulled into the set-up - the characters, the relationships, the wit and charm. Some of the dark humor really took the cake. This involvement was rudely disrupted with songs. Once the mandatory numbers were done with, the meat of the story began and was engagingly narrated to a wonderful peak at interval. After the break too, there are a few very interesting twists that catch you off-guard. Amazingly enough, they are not that largely unpredictable that you feel cheated. You see signs of the twist earlier, only that you don't think too much of it. Only problem though is these twists are balanced off with equally inane and typical turn of events. This wavelike movement in the writing gets more and more annoying and is completely blotched up at the end. Thankfully, the dialogue end of the writing department has taken its job very seriously and has come with some hilarious and witty lines. Completely supported by able delivery to whom most of them are given - Vijay Verma (Pakkya) and Rajpal Yadav (Maa). Jacky Bhagnani's dubbing is off which doesn't help his attempts to emote. I broke up laughing at a supposedly intense scene because Jacky Bhagnani is speaking and yet the camera is at an uncharacteristically, safe, crane top angle. The women are mostly redundant - they are either snubbed down or over-protected by the men around. Amongst the rest of the cast Amitosh Nagpal (Winu), Lushin Dubey (Mrs. Chaturvedi) and Pankaj Tripathi (Pande) leave an impression, especially considering the limited screen-time they have. The wonderful bit is that some of these characters stick and entertain despite being caricatures - more so Vijay Pakkya, Maa and Mrs. Chaturvedi. Or even the cute, petite grandmom. Another bit, I really enjoyed about Rangrezz are a couple of main threads being left unresolved in a very matter of factly manner. It's great that the makers decided to keep some details out, especially considering that the film is already a little too long. (Why not cut the songs out!)Unfortunately, Rangrezz insists on becoming a message film. The extremity and intensity with which the film is narrated almost makes you wonder if it is autobiographical - because some events are too off the chart to be imagined. Yet, Rangrezz ends up making you wonder about people and relationships. So, many turn of events in the film, do make you nod - ""yep, as unbelievable as it looks, it does happen."" Maybe, it's because I didn't expect such maturity from a Jacky Bhagnani film, preconceptions be hailed! But, I am looking forward to the next Priyadarshan film, just in case he decides to go the whole length and make a film that is not bogged down by the need for songs or being filmy. ]"
124,"[It's hard to not have fun watching a film like Captain America: The Winter Soldier on a gigantic IMAX screen, which virtually transports you into the middle of the action. With a plot that attempts to be relevant - what with the current scenario of worldwide electronic espionage - and a neat little cast that has a few welcome additions to the previous film, it keeps you entertained for the most.Yet, as you ponder over it, despite the clear attempts to stand out, this sequel is really no different from the slew of superhero reboots and sequels that are a regular summer feature, now. Same old, same old.In Chris Evans' first turn as the First Avenger, we were served a relatively silent film - a film that set up the character well, and had a genuine attempt at a World War II period feel to it; at least as much as a big superhero film could muster. The sequel is set in the current day, and is bigger, grander and louder.Captain America, now settling in to the quantum leap the world has taken since he last remembered it, is sucked in to a conspiracy within S.H.I.E.L.D. itself, one that has global security ramifications. Meanwhile, he is also up against a mysterious villain, known only as the Winter Soldier, but who is tied intricately with Captain America's past.With a staple dose of humour, tons of action, and with a lot of talk along the way, the film pretends to be a bit of a heavyweight in terms of its plot, but comes across as a tad too superficial, eventually. While the twists are predictable, the action has been shot far better than the last film, with an unsteady look that obviously gives it an edgier feel. The 3D, however, doesn't particularly add much to the film.With Scarlett Johansson's Natasha (or Black Widow) and Marvel's latest big screen debutante Falcon (played quite well by Anthony Mackie) for company this time round, there's a whole lot of forgettable fun to be had while it lasts. Another addition to the cast, which lends the film so much more credibility than it eventually commands, is Robert Redford who plays the enigmatic Alexander Pierce.Samuel L. Jackson - who seems to be having quite some fun in his appearances as Nick Fury, Director, S.H.I.E.L.D. - gets a longish role as well, and one of the best moments of the film is the briefest of hat tips to his Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction. But that's probably just the Tarantino fanboy in me speaking. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo, known for far smaller films, usually lighter in vein, take on their biggest film to date, and they do a decent job with it. Though it lacks any truly jaw-dropping set pieces, the frames and scale are grand enough, while some are actually quite imaginative in execution; one car chase sequence is exhilarating, and the film has the extended action climax we've come to expect.The biggest problem with the film, for me, was the lack of justice to the eponymous villain, the Winter Soldier. His appearances are sporadic, his presence is never fully explained, and his history with Captain America is never given enough meat. There simply is no reason why his name is included in the title of the film, when the plot of the film has virtually nothing to do with him. He is relegated to a side attraction, at best.Expectedly, the end credits scene - directed by Joss Whedon - teases a little, with the introduction of couple of Marvel villains who are poised to add some spice in the future. In fact, it's time we admit that these standalone Avengers films are fast becoming just like teasing nuggets for Avengers: Age of Ultron. That, really, is the big prize we're waiting for, in lieu of the time we give the films along the way. ]"
125,"[It only makes sense for us to pause, once in a while, and ask ourselves the question, ""Why do we believe what we're told, even if we haven't seen it with our own eyes?"" As beings of a supposed higher intellect, with more than enough mental powers of analysis and reason, not to mention a far higher level of curiosity than any other living species, it would seem like humans would be far more individualistic creatures, not given to the level of unquestioning, blind following and hero worship that we're so prone to, in reality. This behaviour of our species is perplexing, to the say the least.Also perplexing, but equally delightful, is Rajat Kapoor's Ankhon Dekhi - an earnest film that straddles the whimsical and the realistic in equal measure, as it shows us the journey of a man who grapples with this very question. A film that is all about the characters, the setting, the texture of their lives, and the mad little moments that come together to complete their various inter-relationships.The film is set in old Delhi - the same Delhi of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Delhi 6 - except you get a far more realistic sense of place here. If a character stops for a kachori or a samosa, you can almost smell the smoky surroundings and the aroma of fried delicacies; you can almost feel the cramped lanes and the overhanging winter.The characters themselves are a mad bunch. There's the protagonist - the elder in the family; a man who reacts to a mid-life crisis in the strangest of manners. But he does so with so much conviction that he builds a guru-like following - a strange paradoxical twist that undermines the very question he seeks the answers to. Then there's his verbose wife who sparkles of sincerity, froths over with frustration over her husband's antics, yet seems the only one who can handle him. And so many more.Ankhon Dekhi is as much about each of the characters and their relationships, as it is about the protagonist's journey. It is here that the film walks a thin line - it almost borders on the surreal at times, while also showing the very real problems and misunderstandings that can crop up between two brothers, between a family and a prospective suitor for their daughter. Rajat Kapoor attempts to show us how, even if circumstances are never in our control, how we react to those circumstances almost always is.But it is also here that that the film tends to waver. The goings-on, at times, seem to be quite pointless, not taking the film either forward or back. Then again, one could argue that so much in real life happens which seems to have no point at all. They happen because they have to. For instance, an inexplicable cameo appearance by a fine actor as a tourist looking for Jama Masjid has no beginning or end to it. It just happens with no explanation, no need, and yet it isn't something you can fault. Or perhaps you can. The pointlessness seems to be the point of it.Ankhon Dekhi manages to make you smile quite often. Charming, moving performances by Sanjay Mishra as the father (and older brother - one of the important relationships shown in the film), Seema Pahwa as his wife and Rajat Kapoor himself as the younger brother anchor the film, as do the little bit parts by the ensemble cast. Brijendra Kala, one of the best character actors we have, for example, does a fine job.Ankhon Dekhi, then, often seems like an easy film to watch, but is also a puzzle at times. A study in contradictions, a gentle look at people and relationships, a wonderful example of how a film can be rooted and still be fanciful. It makes you ponder over it, it makes you want to relive it, but it also doesn't completely convince you of whether you liked the film or not. It raises questions, and answers them with more questions. That, I suppose, is the film's biggest victory.]"
126,"[Some films just bother you at a conceptual level. Youngistaan claims to represent the youth and I shudder at the thought of the youth - you and I - being so shallow and superficial in our approach to problems at the national level. What do I want from my representative in the government? Only my lookout? Only whether my point of view has been represented? I don't think so. I want what is generally good for the society as a whole. But, Youngistaan has created a Prime Minister who thinks his way is the way to go. I consider myself pretty liberal so, I don't really care about my Prime Minister's girlfriend problems or daddy issues. Everyone has them, he is human, he is allowed to have them too. Am I okay with him having a live-in relationship? Now, my liberalism is being put to test. I am okay with friends, but a role model. Hey, wait! In a film about the future of the country, why am I even asking this question? Fine, Youngistaan doesn't talk about just this issue. From the huge ocean of politics the two and a quarter topics they pick are change in calculation of rate of interest on loans for a particular range of people, a scam of some sort, and a quarter of a nod at farmer suicides. The accountant in me couldn't resist laughing at the implications of the interest rate change that our PM Abhimanyu Kaul (Jackky Bhagnani). The build up of the scam led to something so standard (I know, it's sad that there is something like a standard scam) that you wonder what the big issue was. The look of surprise when it is mentioned to our PM that agriculture is our main sector, is actually insulting. His superficial solution, makes you feel worse. Then you consider for a moment if Youngistaan is a story of a 28 year old boy who is emotionally blackmailed into becoming the prime minister of the country. But it doesn't work that way either. It loses that battle at its name itself, right? It wants to represent the youth. It is not an individual's story yet it spends too much time on the love life of that individual while trying to deal with national crises via some jingoism, of course. A storyline with such a premise would be a difficult sell even with the best actors at your disposal. Jackky Bhagnani does come across as sincere. But there is so little time spent on writing a character that is so important, that like I said, I doubt any other actor could've helped. Same goes for Neha Sharma who's supposedly the supportive girlfriend. Again, such a wonderful chance of writing a layered character wasted. A similar waste of talent is Farouque Shaikh. May his soul rest in peace.Sure, there is an attempt at trying something new. It feel flat on its face, but at least they tried. Oh well. ]"
127,"[Boy, do we have a superlatively inept schooling system or not? I should know. Educated myself in degrees I never had any hope of being interested in. The brilliance of the system (teachers, parents, government, and the kids) is that I didn't even realize it! It didn't even occur to me that I could have a creative streak? A complete 180 degree overhaul is a must, in everyone's attitude, including the students themselves. A powerful medium called cinema many a time takes the responsibility of showing us our flaws. Paathshaala is rather regressive, in this age, when more and more schools are trying their best to get out of the rut. Unfortunately, the film does such an awful job, that you want to hold a mirror for them. So, let's give it a shot. Getting the credit-where-it's-due part done with - At any time, dealing with a non-standard topic to make a Hindi film is a huge risk, so that is something I really appreciate. Also, whether I like it or not, a point of view is presented on a contemporary topic. Also, it'd have been so easy for the writer/director to have plugged in romance, the ensuing songs and maybe even a related complication or two. But the refrain is evident. Also there are some sweet moments every once in a while. You'd think someone who's smart enough to make that decision will also use logic, at least partially, in the rest of the story. But apparently that's too much to expect from an FTII product (I wouldn't have said that, if he hadn't tagged it with his name in the titles!). So, you pick a pertinent issue and then go ahead and pick the most extraneous factor to focus on. I mean, ""schools becoming businesses""! I could've borne the issue - you know, audience has no say in what topic writers should choose in the first place, right? But, there are just SO many things wrong with the examples and sub-plots chosen. First of all, how can 100% of the people involved in reality shows and publicists not be so inhuman? You want to stereotype directors of TV shows, ok. Granted. But assistant directors, photographers, agents...everyone is living without a heart? And then you have some more heartless people in the management of this school. If these things are not agonizing enough, you have other inexplicable silences and characters blind following other characters without any rhyme or reason. So many tiny sub-plots seemed like they were there to squeeze in a point which might or might not flow with the rest of the screenplay. For example, the Hindi and Marathi teachers don't like the fact that Rahul (Shahid Kapoor) was an English teacher. Not only do we not know why they carry such an attitude, but it conveniently changes in the very next sequence!?! And such short stories are in abundance. And let's not even get to the laughable climax to the main story. In this ambience, Nana Patekar, Ayesha Takia and Shahid Kapoor do the best they can with this lame script and inane lines. Even at their worst, each three of them could have chosen a better script than this. Oh well...Schooling is not so superfluous. The argument that school facilities to be updated in moderation is half-baked. Monsters don't rule television shows. And the evils of money-making is just way too ""old-school"". *By the way, what's so wrong about a school being profitable? Also, how does charging more fees make a school evil, if they are providing the facilities? And what is so wrong with having good infrastructure? Isn't access to latest possible technology a necessity rather than luxuries? It's not like the intention was to build a school for the poor, if you think teaching has to be philanthropic. No clue why teachers shouldn't be paid competitive salaries. And no clue where that money will come from, if it's not from hike in fees. Another profession that nobility is demanded of is doctors. Why should a person who has spent 27-28 years of his life educating himself not earn for himself?!]"
128,"[There's something off the mark in Darren Aronofsky's Noah. You can't quite place your finger on it, particularly when you're watching the film, with its spectacular imagery and intense themes. Even once you're done, the film stays with you, all the while making you wonder why, despite liking the film largely, something still feels amiss.But that, honestly, is for later. It is what cinema - good, great or average - should always strive to do. Make you question it for hours after you've watched it. Aronofsky's magnum opus does precisely that, even if it doesn't sweep you off your feet completely.The Biblical tale of Noah, and the ark he built to help creation and life survive massive floods that were aimed at cleansing the world, is well known. Noah was a character that apparently fascinated Aronofsky so much that he's always wanted to make a film on him.Noah, the film, is mounted larger than anything Aronofsky has made before. Also, in a big departure for him, this time around he tackles the theological and spiritual aspects directly, instead of layering them beneath complex characters, the way he has always done so far.The effect of these on the film is a mixed bag. Visually, the film is undeniably striking. Remember, the film is set in a time period which can be equated to the infancy of planet Earth. The world itself, then, looks pristine and fresh. The skies a hue of blue we hardly ever see today, the soil and rocks look almost alien. Some breathtaking frames and some interesting time-lapse and stop motion sequences make Noah a film whose images won't exit your mind's eye in a hurry. There are also some beautifully designed CGI creatures, particularly a bunch of them made of stone; with faces that look more like rough rocks, but which actually evoke an emotion. On the flip side, even though the themes of the film - the corruption of humankind, the merciless manner in which we treat the other species we share our planet with, justice, guilt and so on - are universal, the fact is that this tale is set in a particular time. The visuals are impactful, but the characters and their stories seem distinctly - for want of a better word - 'modern'.Nicholas Winding Refn's Valhalla Rising, for instance, (even though it has absolutely no similarity to Noah in terms of story or setting,) has similar visual feel to it. The desolation, which should have come out far more in Noah, which is set millennia earlier than Valhalla Rising, is not nearly as convincing in the former as it is in the latter.Also, the fantasy element in the film is treated with a mix of edgy bravado and cautious trepidation. Almost as if Aronofsky wasn't sure if they were to cater to an adult audience or to children. Nevertheless, the VFX in the film are outstanding for the most.Russell Crowe plays Noah with fiery intent. His physical graph in the film, as well as the sheer intensity in his eyes, traverse a journey which requires a truly committed actor, and Crowe shines. The rest of the cast, though competent, don't really have much to do. Darren Aronofsky's latest, thus, can't be distilled into bad, good or great. Even in its shortcomings, it rises above so much we usually see on the big screen these days. Yet, it will leave you with that lingering feeling; that something about this epic story seems a little off. ]"
129,"[Here's a bullet point review, not because I'm busy otherwise or lazy. But because, some times, as a viewer you feel you are putting in more effort and energy into a film than the writer/director. Ghost versus host story. yawn Most ridiculous product placement, including those krrish 3. Awful and misplaced jokes on a couple of people from the film fraternity. Absolutely gratuitous skin show and sexual content. Shrieking. More shrieking. ""Suspenseful"" buildup to either nothingness or sudden show of a horror face. More ""Suspenseful"" buildup to either nothingness or sudden show of a horror face. Done-to-death typical background score. Use of religion. Promise of a ""next"" in the series. Yes, you guessed right. Ragini MMS 2 is like any other B-grade horror film or Horrex (Horror-Sex for the uninclined) as Ragini MMS 2 likes to call itself. Do not be surprised if I copy-paste this review for the next similarly done film in the genre.Or maybe i should have such a ready review of this nature for each genre. Now, that's a thought. ]"
130,"[Lakshmi's synopsis on Bookmyshow reads -Lakshmi, a 13 year old girl is kidnapped and sold into prostitution. Thrown into this horrific, inhuman world where she is raped and brutally beaten she struggles to survive with the help of the other girls and her own will to never give in.It makes Lakshmi, the film, sound like a run-of-the-mill struggle to victory story, which it very well might be. The film though sensitizes you to horrific human trafficking and how helpless the situation is. At the same time, you do realise that real-life must be only worse. The bravery of one girl, Lakshmi sounds unreal and that is what sets the film apart - it is based on true life. Lakshmi's bravery is real.The narrative feels so real that many a time, it feels like a documentary. Yet, it is difficult to judge if this would have come through if it were not for the brilliant performances - from Monali Thakur, to Shifaali Shah to Satish Kaushik to Nagesh Kukunoor himself. You feel hatred towards the pimp, Chinna played by Nagesh Kukunoor as strongly as you feel Lakshmi and Jyothi's pain through Monali Thakur and and Shifaali Shah respectively. Equal weightage has to be given the unavoidable crass language. It's not just the curse words but the brazen lines with which prostitution and related issues are portrayed that hits you but not in a wannabe way. It is perfectly in tune with the subject in hand.When it comes down to stories based on real life with soulful narration, there is very little to say other than, ""go watch it, because you need to."" Of course, Lakshmi is a very difficult and intense watch - for women, for sure, and hopefully for men too. ]"
131,"[Liam Neeson must've been busy when they were casting for 3 Days To Kill; for this role seems right up his alley. That's the first sense you get as you settle into the film and get acquainted with soon-to-be-ex-CIA Ethan Renner, played by Kevin Costner. Because, you see, Ethan has daughter issues.Yes, on paper there's very little about Charlie's Angels director, McG's latest film that you haven't seen or heard before. And like most CIA/espionage/high-stakes-crime based films, this one too is prone to many lapses of logic.What makes the film not so difficult to sit through is the undercurrent of humour running through it. Combined with Kevin Costner's deadpan portrayal of his character, it gives some genuine laughs, something that really surprised me, considering the CIA backdrop that the film promised.After a point you realize that the silliness is rather the point of the film than a flaw in it. Ethan Renner, after quitting the CIA, is again enrolled for one last job, with a carrot that is dangled before him; one he just can't say no to. In the midst of it, he attempts to patch things up with his estranged teenage daughter Zooey. All of this, for some reason, is set in Paris - which at least lends the film a certain amount of texture in terms of place, even if it is on a superficial level.Ethan's relationship with his daughter is devoted nearly as much time as the action portions of the film, and most of the humour in the film is derived from how they end up intersecting a few times. Interestingly, these two threads of the film are also shot and cut quite differently. The portions with his daughter have a warmer, slower feel to them, while the CIA bits have a cold colour tone, with rapid cuts (which are often random and distract from the action.) In the middle of it, there is the mysterious CIA operative Vivi, who actually recruited Ethan for this one last job. She has an inexplicable air of mystery about her, in terms of what she wears and where she spends her time, none of which is ever explained properly. The biggest letdown of the film, once you get used to how silly it is, is the fact that a lot of mystery is built up, but it all fizzles away for a lame, predictable ending. There are many unanswered questions but you're too bored to ask them anyway. The film is, in fact, predictable for the most part, save for one sudden pre-climax twist that you never expected initially - but seems obvious in retrospect. Again, it is left to the humour in the film to make it tolerable, which it does. Costner and Hailee Steinfeld, who plays his daughter, have an easy chemistry about them. There is no real depth to the father-daughter relationship, but it still makes you smile. Amber Heard as Vivi looks stunning, but all you can think about is what is the point of her at all. The film is also sorely hurt by the lack of a clear and powerful antagonist to Ethan Renner's character.You experience the film, then, not knowing if it has any point at all. In fact, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was watching a silly Hindi rip-off of a mediocre Liam Neeson thriller. That, really, sums up the 2 hours of 3 Days To Kill. ]"
132,"[In a movie that is expectedly all about the violence and bloodshed that its prequel so gorgeously glorified, you'd think that you'd walk out of 300: Rise of An Empire thinking about all the red you saw. On the contrary, the most striking thing about the sequel to 300 is Green; no, not the colour. I'm talking about Eva Green, who delivers a knockout performance - relatively speaking - as the battle thirsty commander of the Persian naval forces, who are out to raze all of Greece to the ground.In fact, it is so unfair that war is considered the domain of men; because in this film, the women quite clearly outshine them. Even Lena Headey, reprising her role as Queen Gorgo, gets very little screen time, but still is far more impressive than the men-folk in the film.A lot of the events in this film actually occur at the same time as what we saw in 300. As Leonidas and his brave, but limited, band of Spartans take on the might of Xerxes at the Battle of Thermopylae, Athenian general Themistokles is waging war with the Persian navy, commanded by the ruthless Artemisia. The film makes big work of this rather thin plot, though, as it flashes back (and even flashes back inside a flashback) to show the lead up to the events of the film.While the film eventually does serve up plenty of what one would expect - grand, gory action scenes in extreme slow motion - the film more than disappoints with its writing. Despite having some terrific opportunities on the story level - like 300, this film is also based on a cult graphic novel by Frank Miller - the team of writers and director Noam Murro treat it in the most ham-handed manner. They quite clearly were just itching to get into the fight scenes, more than anything else.The film only briefly glances at the rise of Xerxes and how he came to be called a 'God-King', which is mentioned in 300. There was so much potential there, as well as in his complex relationship with Artemisia, that it almost seems like pity that so much screen time was wasted watching blood spurt in every conceivable direction.Even the story of Themistokles seems intriguing enough to warrant more meat in the screenplay. Apart from the fact that Sullivan Stapleton, who plays Themistokles, lacks true charisma, his story itself is glossed over, in favour of - you guessed it - slashing, slitting and piercing human flesh. Still, the film would have been far more fun if the action was at least of the quality of 300. However, that is quite not the case. Most of the film occurs at night, so the action scenes are too dark, and just not as eye-catching as what one would have expected. Add to that the 3D glasses, and you're often straining to make out what is actually happening, even though you have the general idea that metal is making contact with body.Eve Green's Artemisia, then, remains the most fun thing about 300: Rise of An Empire. She snarls, fights, smirks and oozes raw sexual energy that is never quite given free reign - except for one rather terrifying kiss - and most of its enigma lies in the way it is held back. The film itself ends on a note that quite surely suggests that a third film is on its way. A chance to make amends, for sure, but by the looks of it, expecting much would be pointless. ]"
133,"[If it were not as expected, Gulaab Gang would have been disappointing. So, as the trailer pointed out, the film is one dramatic scene after another without respite. The drama is magnified by Madhuri Dixit's emphatic dialogue delivery and Juhi Chawla's drawl. The latter actually grows on you in a bit. Juhi Chawla's Sumitra is as cunning as every second politician and the actor makes it very easy for you to hate her. Juhi Chawla is at her best when she is required to portray Sumitra's fickle ego. Unfortunately, Madhuri Dixit's character, Rajjo Devi is directed in such a way that she has no option but to play her character with extra style, even if she is from a little village. Once you get over it though, you see that Madhuri Dixit has tried hard to work in variety within the restraints of the many slow-motion sequences and forced, strong one-liners.It is a shame then, that despite these one-liners, the film lacks punch. There are few side characters that retain interest but then again, they are more or less clones of each other with respect to in their personalities. The writing of the overall film takes the audience's need for justice for women for granted. Right from the titles, you are never given enough cause to side with the gang of women who take justice in  their hands. It is assumed that you know how bad the wrong by the wrong-doers is. Given that, any punishment the Gulaab Gang decides for them is also to be accepted as apt. Moving on, the situations created seem disjointed. It feels more like sequences were conceptualized independently and fit in together forcefully. For example, the sub-plots used to display Sumitra's borderline megalomaniac personality go overboard within the context of the film. Thus losing out on both an awesome dark character that she could be and building a really powerful story to justify these intense sub-plots. Then all you are left with are the vibrant songs. Here I concede, to watch Madhuri Dixit dance, I don't need any context to see grace and elegance incarnate. And this when she's not even at her best. She must be the only actress who actually dances. As opposed to other actors who have the potential to convert even the most melodious of songs to an aerobic beat. Even so, it is disservice to the topic at hand - empowerment of the women and poor from the interiors of the country, if one of the major things I take away from the film are its (not the best) dance sequences. ]"
134,"[Total Siyapaa reminded me of Hrishikesh Mukherjee films in many ways. A quirkily different situation in a regular family; the story of the film spans a short time - in this case just a day; all infused with humor. Unfortunately, the last bit doesn't work too well for Total Siyapaa. The attempt at humor is pretty mediocre and falls flat almost all along the way.There are a couple of times that the lines are really funny and will get a huge laugh out of you. But, other than that, all you do is wonder what is happening and why? This could actually be true of any film with quirky characters and situations. The difference though is that in the ones that are well made, you don't wonder, you just let go and enjoy.Total Siyapaa is something that you just sit through. In the right frame of mind, it won't seem bad enough that you are enduring it. But, it does have immense potential do that to you. The characters just aren't engaging. It then is all left to the situations, the dialogue and the actors. The situation of an Indian girl, Asha (Yami Gautam) bringing home a Pakistani boy, Aman (Ali Zafar) had lots of potential to go either way. To either be out-of-the-world hilarious or to go all jingoistic on you. Fortunately and/or unfortunately it doesn't do either. And as most middle grounds are, it becomes boring.Other than Anupam Kher who is hilarious in his short appearance, the other supporting cast more-or-less overacts. Yami Gautam doesn't have too much to do and Ali Zafar hams as usual. For some reason, I always find Ali Zafar's dubbing off, it comes out way too loud and seems affected. As with most films that seem funny in the trailers, Total Siyapaa exhausts all its funny lines in its two-minute trailer. As we expected and yet, sad. ]"
135,"[You could call Queen a chick-flick, you could call it a coming-of-age film. You could even say it is an apt one to release on ""Women's Day"" weekend. Bracket it as you like it, but there cannot be enough films made like Queen. And I don't say that because Queen sees its protagonist empower herself from a small-town woman who is put down by all around her to a woman who is willing to find herself. Neither is it because a human being comes into their own despite being down in the dumps, without losing their innocence. Films like Queen should be made for the way the story is narrated. You relate to the protagonist from the word go - and that comes from a person who hates use of voice-over to introduce a film. You are with Queen, a part of her thoughts. You jump with her from thought to thought.  And the best bit - the voice-over stops there. It isn't overdone. Kangna Ranaut's Rani or Queen is innocent and that simplicity engages you instantly. Her character builds and grows ever-so-slowly, yet, you are far from getting bored. In fact, one of those rare films that I didn't want to end. Rani and Kangna weave together so seamlessly, that you cannot tell if you are falling in love with the actor or the character.  And while she (both Rani and Kangna) could have carried the film alone on her fragile shoulders, she is lent great support by the supporting cast and the characters they play. Films like Queen also show you that there are things beyond character and situations and overall plot. It's the details and the traps that you keep yourself from falling into. Tiny things make Queen, the film, even more charming - like how she doesn't let go of her handbag - no, not to the street thug as you see in the trailer - but in a club, while dancing. Also, it was so easy to have let Queen get a makeover and transform herself into a confident, outgoing girl, especially given Kangna Ranaut's glamour quotient. But, they don't take that bait. The character transforms but within a believable boundary. This aspect is so refreshing when you compare it to almost every other hindi film in which characters transform into the exact opposite at the slightest instigation.Given all the things that are right about Queen, the discussion would still be incomplete without a word about the music. Wow. Both, the writing and the performances in movies like Highway and Queen swoon you with surprise. It takes me a long while to get over this lovely feeling of being swept of my feet, especially when least expected. Good thing I am in no rush to come back to ground. ]"
136,"[Liam Neeson. Distressed, angry, racing against time. The thought of his daughter is invoked repeatedly. And yes, he kicks some serious backside.Wait, no. I'm not talking about the next film in the Taken franchise. This one is all new; or at least, it claims to be. Liam Neeson, with a singularly boring name - Bill Marks - plays US Air Marshall with a drinking problem, because of the events of his past. Obviously, it has to the plane that he is on, which gets picked for some mid-air shenanigans by an unknown man with a mobile phone.It is possible to enjoy Non-Stop, as long as you leave your brains the same place that you do, before watching, say, Chennai Express. It demands dollops of suspension of disbelief, and perhaps some love for one of the finest actors of his generation, to keep a straight face while watching the film.The plot is silly and far-fetched, and the execution is typical. The protagonist is introduced as a grieving loner, then an array of characters are shown, some with suspicious demeanors, so that we know who to keep an eye out for. Everyone knows how American security has become post 9/11, particularly regarding flights, so the tension mounts along any way.Luckily enough, the film gives you no time to breathe as it sets up the plot and goes about trying to resolve it. The constricted plane setting is used well, which alternately gives you that claustrophobic feeling, without particularly getting monotonous in feel; after all, almost a hundred minutes of the film are spent inside the aircraft itself.One of the annoying aspects of the film, however, is the writing and casting of the side characters. The stock, silent Muslim; the over-talkative African-American, the aggressive, well-built bald thug-type character; the scared child on the flight; and so many more - everything in the film is typical, without an ounce of originality.Unsurprisingly, Neeson himself is the strongest thing about this enterprise. You'd think he'd be bored doing something he's done enough already, but he still manages to hold you while he is in the thick of the suspense. Julianne Moore is simply wasted, though. One of the other, minor points that I liked was the manner in which the text messages are styled in large font across the screen, when the characters send each other SMSes in the film. They were simple and elegant, in form as well as movement.What you get, then, is a trade-off. You forsake logic and cinematic craft in favour of quick thrills, which the film has plenty of. You'll either be too busy trying to guess who Neeson is chasing, or you may sit back with the realisation that no matter what, Liam Neeson is having more fun than you are. ]"
137,"[Why do you lie to your partner? To avoid confrontation, to protect them from getting hurt, to protect yourself from hurting, and maybe because you did something to get rid of boredom that they wouldn't approve of. You could blame them, you could blame yourself, but the point is that you end up lying, when you are expected to be honest. This is true of both, men and women. Shaadi Ke Side Effects expresses a very skewed view of this aspect of married life, in a far too stretched-out and repetitive fashion. I understand there are women out there who are like Trisha Roy (Vidya Balan) - obsessed by their child, want nothing to do with their career, friends, husband. And yes, as shocking as it sounds there are men out there like (tackily named) Siddharth Roy (Farhan Akhtar) who think of their child as the third person. But, I guess obsession by a partner begets apathy towards that obsession by the other partner - the obsession could be sports for one couple, socialization for another, food for the third and so on. But, none of this made interesting copy in Shaadi Ke Side Effects.The stereotyping of women is infuriating. But then hey, there are only so many Hindi films in which it is not. In cases like these, I convince myself the makers are not generalizing, they are narrating the story of one man and one woman and their relationship. And then, you see her sister who is similar. And you smile, cool down and say, ""okay, it runs in the genes."" But, Shaadi Ke Side Effects doesn't stop at that. There are sweeping statements about parents of little children. Even under the satire garb, the exaggeration is gag-worthy. And despite all of this, I saw myself taking sides - for the record, more the man's in this case than the woman's. At one point, when things went the exact opposite of what Siddharth wanted, many in the audience, including me, blurted a ""oh no!"". Towards the end, I almost furled an abuse at Trisha out loud. This is commendable, considering that other than the fact I know such characters exist, I didn't identify with them at all. 100% credit to Vidya Balan and Farhan Akhtar for that. Ram Kapoor and Vir Das do add their bit of normal and quirk to the mix, but it is all about the lead couple. But for them, Shaadi Ke Side Effects is one of those films that attempt to find a solution for a serious problem, but don't want to lose out on audience by taking the subject seriously. Given my overall angst towards the film and its take, I appreciate that they do try to say something that is universally acceptable - to each his own. The problem though is that they try to inject it with humor using an exaggerated dose of hyperbole - only to end up flat on its face. Worse yet, you have seen almost all the quippy one-liners in the trailers. Other than a couple of witticisms in the first 15-20 minutes, there is hardly any new material that makes you laugh later in the film. This is one film that shouldn't have been longer than a 100 minutes. Each of the 50 minutes after that 100-minute mark is as boring as the Roys' marriage. That is one-third of the film. Not done at all. The music is decent, but when it adds minutes that elongates the experience, that too becomes annoying. Relationships bud, they blossom, they peak, they plateau, you struggle to make changes to them and then wait to see if they bud again or die. Except that with Shaadi Ke Side Effects is about the struggle. It is cute that the couple is grappling with the relationship and wants to find a way out rather than cop out. You might want them to sort it out. But the problem is that you don't necessarily want to witness it.]"
138,"[If you've watched Hunger or Shame, then your first impression of Steve McQueen's third feature, 12 Years a Slave, could possibly be that it's a loud film, by his standards; loud in every sense. Which is strange, because in many ways, the film is also like Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained under the influence of a sedative. Quite clearly, everyone can't pull off loud.Steve McQueen's usual tropes remain - an intense human drama, long takes, abrupt cuts that transport you to something completely different from the previous scene or shot; yet, 12 Years a Slave is a bit of a mixed bag. Despite the fact that McQueen has handled his considerably larger budget and star cast with relative ease, it still seems like too much of a departure for him.The film, which tells us the story of Solomon Northup, a 'free man' in the mid-19th century - indeed, a talented man and a musician - who is duped and then forced to be a slave. It follows an episodic structure - if slightly non-linear, as it flashes back and forth in time often - as he is sent from one owner to the next. Despite the fact that the film does hook you, and it affects you with some of the sheer brutality that slaves had to endure in those dark days of American and world history, the biggest problem with this film is that it doesn't move you enough. You expect McQueen to emotionally or intellectually stimulate you, but it doesn't happen.The character of Solomon Northup, who is the soul of the film, comes across as too uni-dimensional. For a man who has spent a bulk of his life being free, there is a certain placidity in the way he goes about things, choosing to display a spine in the most unnecessary situations, while meekly accepting his slavery, when in fact his protest should have been more vehement. The relationships he forms with the people around him just don't strike a chord. You don't see why you should sympathize with his character at all.And for once, Hans Zimmer disappointed me with his music score. Apart from the fact that it, like the rest of the film, is too loud for its own good, it also sounds far too similar to what Zimmer has been churning out for Chris Nolan lately. There's only so much you can invest emotionally into the atrocities committed on a human being, if the background score reminds you of Inception. After a point, then, I was looking forward to seeing some of my favourite stars making their cameo appearances one after the other. Benedict Cumberbatch, Michael Fassbender (whose look is quite superb in the film), and Brad Pitt keep things interesting. Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays Solomon, is clearly committed to the part. He rises above the writing often, but is let down by the character more than anything else.12 Years a Slave talks about an important subject, and serves as a grim reminder of some of the horrific cruelties human beings have inflicted upon each other. It also creates a nice sense of period. But it's shortcomings lie in the narration of the story. You're simply left wondering about all those who saw far worse and for far longer, compared to which 12 years just doesn't seem so long at all.]"
139,"[He has done this before, Paul Greengrass; and I mean that in the nicest way. Greengrass has a penchant for taking stories based on true events - usually ones where we already know how they end - and he still manages to make gripping cinema out of them; the kind that fastens you to your seats.The pinnacle of this still remains United 93, which is personally one of my favourite films ever. Using that familiar handheld camera and a brown, gritty colour tone, his latest offering is Captain Phillips - a film based on the real life Richard Phillips, who was captain aboard an American container ship, which was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009.Grim and claustrophobic, because so much of the film is set in tight quarters in the middle of nowhere, the film is almost unrelenting in its thrill factor. And while many filmmakers choose the handheld route to tell their tale, Greengrass always manages to make things look like they're real and happening before your very eyes, oblivious of the fact that everything is, in fact, being staged for the camera.The confrontation scenes between the pirates, led by their leader Muse, and Captain Phillips are easily the highlight of the film. Watching the terrific Tom Hanks, in one of his career best performances (despite a strangely jarring accent), spar with young debutante Barkhad Abdi, who plays Muse, are a treat, because of just how convincing Hanks, in particular, is. Abdi is raw at times, but he mostly manages to match up to Hanks; a feat in itself. The film, admittedly, makes for a better big screen watch, by sheer nature of it's subject. Thrills are obviously best experienced in darkened cinema halls. Yet, the DVD of Captain Phillips is so rich in content, that it actually makes the DVD a must-own for any true cinephile.The most important feature, of course, is the option of watching the entire film with a commentary by Paul Greengrass. There's nothing quite like having the director talk you through a film, to tell you just what it took to conceptualise or film a particular scene. He also narrates interesting snippets; like how Tom Hanks and the young men playing the Somali pirates hadn't ever met before filming their first meeting in the film. This was because Greengrass wanted to capture that unfamiliarity and nervous tension between them when they confront each other for the first time. Stuff like this truly adds value, when one wants to understand what a director's vision really entails.And if the director's commentary wasn't enough, then there is also an in-depth 55 minute featurette titled 'Capturing Captain Phillips', which is essentially the making of the film. Again rich in all that it took to make a tough production like this a reality, the featurette is another little gem that aids in understanding the finer nuances of the craft of film production.A single DVD packs in the film as well as the bonus features. The Captain Phillips DVD is one of those rare DVDs that one must buy more for the special features than for the film itself, even though the film is definitely worth a watch. United 93 is still my favourite Greengrass film, but with Captain Phillips, he surges ahead nonetheless. ]"
140,"[When was the last time you stumped yourself? When was the last time you bumped into something and enjoyed it, something that you never imagined would give you pleasure? That feeling of newness, that blissful ecstasy, why would you want to ever let go of that? This is what you experience with Veera (Alia Bhatt). You experience her pain too. Yet, Highway leaves you a little wanting and doesn't make you a part of its journey, 100%. Alia Bhatt is gorgeous. I had to say that out first. It's not the Barbie doll look from Student of the Year, it's not her cuteness, she is a gorgeous actor. If you'd have told me after watching her debut that she can fill the screen with her presence, making me feel her pain and exuberance equally (in one shot, that too!), I wouldn't have scoffed at you, but I would've snickered internally for sure. From the first shot you can tell this young lady means business - Her disdain and genuine boredom are apparent and then she takes you along with her, through a myriad of emotions. Her comic timing is perfect. Some of her lines could have sounded so silly, if they weren't delivered with the ease that she has being Veera. And for Veera alone you could watch Highway. She's crazy, not eccentric. She's bound by society's ""good girl"" tag and doesn't realise she could feel as free she feels when she's kidnapped accidentally. There are a couple of scenes that point at social menaces that need to be addressed pronto. I hate to undermine their importance, but these scenes do seem a little out-of-place within the context of the film. They disconnect you from Veera's journey though they are an integral part of it. Surely, Alia Bhatt cannot be blamed for that, her long (background-score-less!) shots in these scenes are something I haven't seen in a long time. The disconnect is more to do with how it's placed in the film. Individually, the scenes are great but when they run as a part of the story, they look like they've come out of the blue. Similarly, even though Randeep Hooda has done a wonderful job with his brooding, disgruntled, helpless, contract killer Mahaveer, the chemistry is missing as a couple. Maybe this disjointed chemistry is intentional, they are an unlikely couple - a hooligan from a village and a city-bred, rich girl belonging to a well-known and powerful family. Yet, for a romance to kick in, for you to root for it and not the individual characters, you need to believe they are in love with each other - this is missing in Highway.Highway's beauty, along with the mesmerizing landscapes and minimal use of background music (and lovely folklore when it is used), is its pace. It is slow and keeps you engaged. It builds up piece by piece and the individual characters grow on you gradually. But, such pace is not everyone's cup of tea. I would really love to see the film once again without the cackling from the audience. Interestingly though, the audience is paying enough attention to laugh out loud at some of the brilliant one-liners and is equally attentive when the intense ""social message"" scenes come on. It is likely that Imtiaz Ali, the writer might have wanted to focus on the message while keeping it wrapped in a warm yet emotionally violent story. But it is the other message that charmed me better. It is not new, it is not profound, but it held me glued - that freeing your spirit can show you how you are in charge and yet, to free your spirit, you need to take charge. ]"
141,"[If you're a fan of the original 1987 RoboCop, this 2014 version will disappoint you sorely. It has none of the spunk and clever audacity of the earlier film, and takes itself entirely too seriously. Thus, despite having a far superior cast to the original, particularly the supporting cast, the film rarely rises above any generic action film of the recent past.As we're introduced to a future where unmanned robots are intelligent enough to be deployed for law enforcement abroad, on the American homeland they're still illegal. The scheming private corporation that builds these robots then creates something that can woo the American citizens as well - man plus machine. RoboCop. Largely, the plot of the film is quite like the earlier film. In fact, the tweaks to the plot actually make more sense than the original film. Also, the gritty, hand-held feel adopted this time round is more in sync with the kind of films we're used to today. But what really lets the film down is its screenplay. Predictable to the core, the film pretends to have twists and turns, but they are ones that can be spotted from a mile away. Like the original, it attempts to be a commentary on American capitalism and political hypocrisy as well. For example, it seems quite typical that American-built robots are being used outside the country for law enforcement, but aren't used on American soil. But these attempts come across as too blatant, instead of the pulpy satire that the original managed to pull off.There is also an attempt to highlight how, no matter what, a beating human soul trumps cold machine intelligence. This, however, is so half-baked that it comes across as looking juvenile. Surprisingly enough, Brazilian director Jose Padilha, of the cult Elite Squad fame, doesn't manage to leave a stamp on this film. It comes across as far too familiar from the word go, and not one sequence stands out or stays with you post the film. You wait with bated breath, for instance, to see RoboCop come to life in full glory, but when it eventually happens, it falls flat. If there is anything in the film that stands out, it is the supporting cast of the film; namely Michael Keaton as Raymond Sellars, the boss of OmniCorp, and Gary Oldman as the conscientious Dr. Dennett Norton, the man responsible for creating RoboCop. The two of them, in their respective cheesy roles are absolutely top-notch. They overplay their characters just right, for a film like this. On the other hand, one wonders what in the world Samuel L. Jackson was doing, embarrassing himself as the loud television host Pat Novak. Swedish star Joel Kinnaman plays the role of Alex Murphy and RoboCop, but he just doesn't get enough scope to perform. It almost seems like he was merely going through the motions.There's some fun to be had in watching RoboCop spar with Rick Mattox, a robot controller and tactical advisor who despises the idea of a hybrid robot-human. However, this doesn't have too much overall impact on the film, because it isn't devoted too much time. This new RoboCop is mere deja vu, and not of the good kind. You'd be better off catching the original on DVD, or watching Padilha's two Elite Squad films instead.]"
142,"[The real story of Pompeii is a tragic one. A thriving city under the Roman empire, progressive for its time, gutted by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, a constantly rumbling volcano that had been non-destructive for centuries till then.Director Paul W. S. Anderson, unlike his namesake (the one with that most enviable of filmographies!) is best known for camp; think Mortal Kombat or Death Race. In his hands, Pompeii, the film, becomes a VFX-heavy actioner with a love story as well as a bromance thrown in. The film isn't particularly unwatchable, but this is one of those films where you sorely miss familiar faces in the lead roles; the kind of film that needed raw star power to justify the scale it has been mounted on.The story, undoubtedly, had weight. A budding period romance with obstacles of its own, in a town at the base of a volcano that, unknown to them, is on the verge of a cataclysmic eruption. If told with a more sensitive, auteristic vision, the film had the potential to go down as an epic love story.Instead, what we get are predictable gladiator-style fight scenes, English with British and American accents in a Roman city, and a half-baked romance where you hardly ever feel a connect with the lead pair - simply because you hardly ever see them together. In fact, the lead character Milo's romance gets lesser footage than the story of his growing friendship with a fellow slave named Atticus. Such is the contrast between these two stories, that in the dying moments of the film, you root for the two men to end up alive together, irrespective of whether Milo unites with his lady love or not.All of this could still have made for some genuine big screen fun, if the film had a charismatic cast, or, at the very least, a big star essaying the role of Milo. Kit Harrington, who plays the mysterious, strong and silent Milo, just doesn't have the magnetic persona that was needed to make him a character you'd want to cheer for. The familiar faces in the cast - Kiefer Sutherland, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jared Harris - seem almost embarrassed to be there. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Atticus with an endearing stiffness. Despite having no obvious acting skills, you root for him more than you do for Milo.To be fair, the film does have decent VFX. The long shots of Pompeii, with the imposing Vesuvius as the backdrop, look quite impressive, as does the period feel, even if its historical authenticity is quite suspect. But the action set pieces aren't particularly imaginative, and the 3D glasses darken the film a tad too much. Mercifully, the film is brisk and short, not testing your patience too much.Despite being mounted on the scale that it is, Pompeii gives a generic, been-there-seen-that feel to it, which isn't aided in any way by having no anchoring presence to carry the film through. It's the kind of film that is so hard to take seriously, even though it seems like there are people who've given it their all. It wasn't until the final shot of the film, a touching symbol of eternal love, that it struck me that there was a lot of wasted potential in the real as well as reel story of Pompeii.]"
143,"[In a tiny, innocuous scene in Fandry, almost in the background, a school teacher begins explaining to his students the subtext in a poem by a Marathi saint. The poem's title, roughly translated, means, ""All is not what it seems."" Apart from the tale of innocent love and the wry look at caste divides in rural India that Fandry is, it is also a gentle reminder of how nothing that we see or hear can be taken at face value; because nothing, really, is what it seems.Everyone in Fandry is chasing something. The dark-skinned son of the lone 'untouchable' family in the village - the family given the filthiest of odd jobs to do - yearns to look fairer and better. He pines for his classmate, the daughter of an upper class family. The ones in the village who are better off dream of Mumbai. And those in Mumbai? Yearning for a quiet life in the village perhaps? The cycle is endless. Director Nagraj Manjule sometimes chooses subtle symbolism and puts it blatantly in front of you at other times, as he exposes how frail our social structure really is. He does it while never taking himself or the film too seriously. Fandry, incidentally, means 'pig'; one of the many symbols used in the film. Fandry could as well be termed a period film; except that the 'period' shown in the film is today. Here and now. We know, because of references to the IPL and Facebook. But the manner in which man believes in the concept of superior and inferior, and how the ones considered inferior are looked down upon with vile disgust has held true since the dawn of humankind itself, and will likely continue far into the future. If you think about it, it seems hard to fathom just how man came up with the concept of caste. But millennia of conditioning have come to mean that the 'lowest' in the social strata have come to actually believe that they belong at the bottom of the ladder. So, a father lashes out at his son who dares to dream, and who refuses to conform to what society expects him to be - the village 'untouchable'.Fandry is, thus, heartbreaking. A boy old enough to not be termed 'innocent', but young enough to dream of a better life with honest sincerity isn't allowed to do so. You root for him, you want him to be allowed to dream, even if you can almost see that his dreams very well don't stand a chance of fulfilment. Because, you see, he represents all of us. We're all prisoners of what is expected of us; Jabya, the protagonist, symbolizes each and every one of us.Fandry is scathing and witty in equal measure. Shot without frills and technical show-boating, it concentrates on what each frame, each event stands for. The characters are real, and real means gray. Whether it is enforced or whether it is out of free will; each character is made to conform. So, in one of the film's best moments, the whole village comes to a standstill - because they're 'expected to'. The what and why of it, I'll leave for you to discover.The raw, rural Marathi dialect is tricky, so it helps that the film is subtitled in English. It also means that the film can reach a wider audience, particularly because it is one of the rare Marathi films to get a release outside Maharashtra as well. Fandry is a brutally honest film, one that makes you smile and brood equally. The production design and the cast play a large role in creating that world for you.Somnath Awghade, who plays Jabya, plays him earnestly, with full conviction. He, as well as the boy who plays his friend, are so natural, it astounds you. Kishore Kadam, who tends to be the same in every film, is perfect here as Jabya's father. He makes you feel for him almost always. Writer-director Nagraj Manjule, who also makes a charming little cameo as the village oddball, tells us a story with universal appeal, but in a manner that roots it to what he clearly knows best. At a crisp 103 minutes, the film is paced beautifully, and it has a simple guitar piece that is like the soul of the film. Everytime it plays, it seems like a dream - it reminds you that for all us, there's always something that's out of reach.Fandry, then, is as much our story as it is Jabya's. True, we may not live in the village like him, and our dreams may not be the same as his. But then, as Manjule keeps reminding us, maybe they actually are; because nothing is what it seems.]"
144,"[Women are ill-treated, disrespected and discriminated against the world over. But in the rural heartland of India, this problem exists at a whole different level. A woman is considered worthless, a burden, a being whose existence is divided into two truths - either uphold 'family honour' or die.How hard must it be, then, to stand up and fight for the cause of women in a society like this? Sampat Pal, the woman behind Gulabi Gang - an organization that has gone on to receive international recognition - is a shining example of a woman choosing to empower herself and others like her, because society doesn't deem her equal to men.Nishtha Jain's documentary on Sampat Pal and her organization is an eye-opening piece of work. It brings into focus what we've only heard or read about so far - just how truly helpless a woman can be in the interiors of India. Yet, it also serves as an inspiration, not just to women like those we see in the film, but to all of us. It reminds us that standing for a just cause needs courage and vision.Sampat Pal anchors the film, as we follow her around while she holds public gatherings, recruitment drives and personally delves into the burning and subsequent death of a young woman. The film looks at the last of those in great detail, almost with the pensive inquisitiveness of a murder mystery, before we realize that this is just one of the myriad frustrating tales of the life of a woman being taken for granted.Despite the hope the film gives, however, there is also the sense of what a mountain this battle of changing societal mindset is. A majority of the women themselves believe that a woman doesn't have the option of choosing to live her life the way she wants; they still believe that a woman who has fallen in love has besmirched the family's honour. You know the problem is serious when even a Gulabi Gang member of many years still feels the same.Sampat Pal has a powerful, charismatic presence. With a sprinkling of light moments, she ensures that the film maintains a brisk pace throughout, bringing us face to face with a bunch of people who are victims of the malaise that eats our society from within, as well as those who dare to stand up for change.Each face in the film has character. The sight of the army of pink, trooping away for a cause with lathis in their hands; dangerously treading on the toes of the law but doing it with the weight of conviction against all odds; Gulabi Gang has an intriguing story that must be known.]"
145,"[The most audacious stories are often found in real life; and when these stories are adapted for the screen in the right manner, they usually have what it takes to enthral viewers. Ben Affleck's Argo, for instance, was the perfect example of how a real life tale can be adapted to make a thrilling film.A cursory glance at George Clooney's latest, The Monuments Men, can make one feel that the film has precisely what it takes to deliver what Argo did - a hooking World War 2 based premise and a cast that has the chops to pull it off in style. Think about it - an unlikely bunch of non-soldiers are brought together and sent in to World War II Europe to retrieve valuable pieces of art that were stolen by Hitler's regime, on his orders. Picassos and Rembrandts and Michelangelos; artworks that are like the markers of humankind's cultural progress; art that, if lost, would be like a loss of a fragment of humankind itself.Yet, at least in cinema, there is but a thin line between subtlety and exaggeration; and in choosing the former, Clooney ends up making a staid film that is underwhelming at best.Of course, it was rather brave of Clooney to choose the understated manner in which he chose to narrate a story that had enough in it to become a thrill-a-minute heist film. Hollywood studios aren't particularly known to favour the kind of narrative style he has chosen. The film has its heart in the right place, but ends up becoming a victim of its own manner. The question, really, is how subtle is 'too subtle'.The film doesn't particularly have a graph; you expect it to rise and rise as it progresses, but it never does. You expect it to lead you to an exciting finale, only to leave you disappointed. Laced with a few genuine smile-worthy moments and with a large amount of respect for the masters of art, the film focuses more on instilling an awareness about just how important our art is, in the overall story of humanity.Despite taking us through familiar people and places - at least from history textbooks, if nothing else, the film fails to truly engage and connect. In fact, the film is set in the fag end of WWII, when Germany had begin to withdraw a lot of their European occupation. The stellar cast - Clooney himself, Matt Damon, Jean Dujardin, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett, amongst others, do a great job - precisely what was expected of them. However, the film jumps between their stories too often, which concurrently means that no particular character stays with you once the film is over.As director, Clooney is certainly maturing with time. He easily seems more in control than he did in The Ides of March, for instance. As I mentioned earlier, the route he chose to narrate this particular story is a brave one; a world away from the one chosen by Affleck in Argo. One wonders though, whether it is that which proves to be the film's biggest undoing. Including the audience and evoking a response only in rare spurts, The Monuments Men is mostly just bland.]"
146,"[Hollywood it seems is desperate for new villains.  They have exhausted the Germans, the Russians, the Afghans, the Italians, the East Europeans and not necessarily in that order.  So what is left?  In a post-cold-war world which is marked by increasing fundamentalist movements of all shades, there ostensibly remains only one.  That which was a good friend for so long has now turned into a deadly foe.  Ladies and Gentlemen welcome to the global Banking system as the Villain.The International is a thriller which articulates this premise in the first few minutes.  Unfortunately, global financial manipulations and a Bank in particular do not a cinematic villain make.  One needs to have characters and faces, quirky, hateful faces if possible.  Yes, the film has the required blackguards, but none of them strike us as particularly crooked and corrupt, clothed as they are in impeccable suits and polished shoes.  Or maybe that is the point; they are just ordinary people like you and I, albeit of a different class.  They are people doing a job, like all of us, I guess.  From a cinematic viewpoint, this makes them prosaic and lifeless.  They remain props, whose role is to fill the frame and nothing else.The film's opening sequence is well shot with clever use of editing and sound mixing, but sadly this is not sustained thereafter.  The plot unravels as the director jumps from one scenic European location to another and we understand that some kind of global conspiracy is in motion.  Clive Owen and Naomi Watts then appear.  This heterosexual pairing is quite insipid, no chemistry, no bonding, no nothing between them, possibly again, because they are just ""ordinary"" people doing a job.  Well whatever the reason, thirty minutes into the movie, and one is trying to keep ennui at bay.  The only consolations are the locations, which look as if they are just what the James Bond franchise ordered.  In the first half the plot starts to get complicated, but the film manages reasonably well.  It is in the second half that it flounders. Tom Tykwer is the chap who helmed Run Lola Run and also Perfume.  He is known for his breakneck editing and flashy style, but this film has none of it.  There is just one magnificent action sequence set in the Guggenheim museum, which one licks one's chops over.  But it is a classic case of too little, too late.  The rest of the film remains sluggish and produces in the viewer an extreme apathy.Clive Owen looks dazed and confused, Naomi Watts is inanimate throughout, and the rest of the characters flit in and out.  The director was possibly trying to bridge the gap between a social comment and an action thriller, and it looks like he really could not make up his mind.  At one point, the film looks set to take off into hard core action - Hollywood style, but that does not happen.  Instead it just fizzles off into befuddled stupidity.  To make it worse, most of the dialogues at important moments seem to consist only of platitudes.One feels depressed at the pointlessness of it all: the director has talent, he had a topical premise to work with, but the end result is strictly ho-hum.]"
147,"[Spike Jonze's Her is primarily about loneliness. Everyone is connected to their computer at all times. But to each other? Not so much. Wide shots of public spaces show almost everyone walking by themselves, but look closely, and they are all talking. You'd be forgiven for thinking that they're all on the phone with a loved one. In fact, there's a good chance they're all talking to their computers.Welcome to the future; where your computer runs your life even more than it does today; where operating systems have gotten so smart, they're like a real live person to talk to; without a body, of course. In fact, it has become possible to develop a real relationship with them, with real feelings involved.And yet, how fruitful can such a relationship be? Will the fundamental disparity between man and machine be an obstacle? Will concepts like commitment, fidelity, romance, intimacy and the likes ever manifest themselves within the existential realm of machines? In this futuristic world, we are introduced to Theodore Twombly - the kind of man it is so easy to root for, yet one who seems to give off the air of desolate melancholy. A chance purchase - a brand new advanced operating system - introduces him to the unlikeliest of possible partners; his OS, who goes by the name Samantha. The film, visually bathed in golden glows and flares, gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling throughout, despite the fundamentally cold theme of loneliness; it is funny and heart-breaking in equal measure. As we observe Theodore and how his relationship with Samantha develops, we begin to see that such a relationship, between man and machine, actually seems not only possible, but also probable in the near future.There is a reason for Theodore's loneliness, and there is a reason why Samantha is able to fulfill the gap, without being real in flesh and blood. Their relationship follows the most logical of paths, even though you're never sure of whether you truly want to give your own personal stamp of approval to the relationship or not. The fact remains that the fundamental emotional needs of a human soul are unique to our species. No matter how far into the future we are, some things just will not change - the yearning for a warm hug, the need for physical companionship, the wish to have the one you love all to yourself - these are purely human traits, and nothing can change that.Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore Twombly almost perfectly. Here is another actor - like Daniel Day Lewis and Christian Bale - who seems to morph into the character he's playing almost always. He wins you over almost instantly, and yet, you can see why he is a lonely man. What makes his performance even more noteworthy is that he doesn't have a physical presence to react to. Samantha the OS is voiced by Scarlett Johansson, who is a joy to hear. She tinges her voice with the right amount of naughtiness, playfulness and sexiness. Amy Adams, another chameleon when it comes to slipping into characters, plays Theodore's friend, and she is so natural, it is hard to believe she is acting.But the true heroes of Her are the cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, whose shots make the film a visual joy, and writer-director Spike Jonze. If his Being John Malkovich and Adaptation were written by the maverick Charlie Kauffman, this time he goes completely solo. The narrative is far simpler than his previous films, and yet, that in no way implies that it doesn't have deft touches and layers that enchant you. Her is a shining example of a simple, powerful concept with the right embellishments leading to a captivating film. Depending on how you look at it, it may leave you with a smile, or with a lump in your throat; either way, it is the kind of film that is hard to not be moved by.]"
148,"[Friendship. It's made to look so fickle in Gunday that you feel nothing for any of the characters or their relationships. And love of course, is superficial. In any case, love drama, friendship melodrama, and a few abuses directed towards the ""system"" later, Gunday is spread too thin on an already flimsy plot line. Gunday is one of those films that make you wonder why it was made at all. The action is plain and pretty much boring. The performances are overtly stylish and overbearing. The dialogue delivery by one and all is too focussed on making an impact without having any support from the dialogue itself. The writing is so predictable that even if you haven't seen the trailer you can tell what's going to happen next. If you've seen the trailer, that's pretty much all you need to know. It is a shudder-worthy shame that this story about friendship nods its hat to Sholay. Given all these aspects, you could keep yourself from blaming the cast. Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor flare their nostrils appropriately and seem to have worked extra hard on moving their lips to indicate impact and energy. There is a one off scene each for Ranveer Singh and Priyanka Chopra which gives them room to let go of the forced style and actually emote. As one would expect, it is too little and too late. DO NOT get me started on how Irrfan Khan is wasted here. A little too late also comes the courtesy mumbo-jumbo about how the protagonists do what they do because of the ""system"". That is a tough one to sell, given their attitude from when they were shown as 12-13 year olds. The only silver lining is that the first half is reasonably well-paced. There was also this flicker of a comment on how best friends can take each other for granted, but as the movie progressed, it felt like only I saw it. But, other than that Gunday is as mediocre as it gets.But then again, what do you expect from a film that has characters grow up from being children to adults with the camera on their running feet only to break into a song introducing themselves. Or a film that has too many themes and doesn't take a single one seriously - love, friendship, angst against system. ]"
149,"[And some times, love doesn't happen at first sight, unlike most films would have us believe. Or love doesn't necessarily follow intense animosity. Some times, you get to know a person and then you acknowledge the attraction you felt towards them. And some times, the film tries this stunt and it works even though it falls into the typical trappings of romantic comedies every once in a while. Given that this genre is done to death, it is the characters and the moments chosen to drive the story forward that have to do all the hard work. The characters have to make themselves interesting with their gray shades and humanness and at the same time make us root for them. The situations have to present themselves in a novel way without seeming totally out of the box. Hasee Toh Phasee succeeds on both counts, to a large extent. Meeta (Parineeti Chopra) is a zany character that is immediately likable. She is overtly quirky and yet given Parineeti's skills she makes you overlook her craziness as ""possible"". It's not that Parineeti Chopra outdoes herself or has given a marvelous performance. Neither has she under-played the part. She just does her thing and convinces us to be with Meeta, for Meeta.Nikhil (Siddharth Malhotra) too is interesting because he is so plain. You don't see such characters in films who are your regular John Doe and yet can keep you interested in how his life goes about. In fact, it is his simple-mindedness that charms you. That and the glimpse of craziness that is stifled by the ""system"".Parineeti and Siddharth play it well together too. From the indifference to the neutral to the confused to the smitten - they convince you through the steps of falling in love. It is the side characters that leave you unconvinced. All but Manoj Joshi overact and make the act borderline slapsticky. And therein lie the traps that Hasee Toh Phasee falls prey to. There are a few cliche situations that it finds itself in. But, the point to note here is that the film is set in the middle of a wedding and it is a Karan Johar production and yet things stay more-or-less non-masala. That is the director and writer's victory. It is refreshing to watch something different being attempted in as rundown a genre as rom-com. It is refreshing to see the lead female protagonist get something real to do - maybe the technicalities are all over the place but at least she isn't one of the two extremes tomboy/chirpy-bubbly or demure/shyness incarnate. It is a little disappointing to see her too, make her life about her man. But, then again, maybe that is what love does to you. ]"
150,"[After the considerable success of The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, it's time for the third film in the series - The Bourne Ultimatum. Thankfully, it's arguably the best so far.Where Ultimatum really comes into its own is the sheer pace at which the story unfolds. Director Paul Greengrass maintains an extremely high tempo throughout the movie. As Bourne attempts to keep one step ahead of his pursuers, Greengrass employs generous helpings of handheld camera shots and ultra-quick cuts to keep up the breathless ride. Every now and again, he'll give the audience a few minutes' respite, before revving up again.And Bourne certainly gets around. Even as the plot races through Moscow, Paris, London, Madrid, Tangiers and New York, each city is given room to shine. The Waterloo Station and Tangiers scenes are particularly memorable. Damon plays it straight down the middle. There are no cheesy one-liners here. There's a strong supporting cast, with solid turns from David Strathairn as his CIA nemesis Noah Vosen, Joan Allen as a more sympathetic CIA director, Paddy Constantine as a British journalist and Albert Finney as the scientist mastermind behind the Treadstone programme. Of course, comparisons with the James Bond series are inevitable. In fact, the Bourne and Bond franchises have more differences than similarities, although it's interesting to see how the latest Bond film - Casino Royale - cuts back on the gadgets 'n' girls formula and has a more Bourne-like, gritty feel. Perhaps they're inspiring each other - certainly a couple of scenes (a rooftop chase and bathroom hand-to-hand scrap) crop up in both Casino Royale and Ultimatum.Greengrass keeps the violence focussed. This is no gore-fest. The bodycount is surprisingly low for a movie of this type and there's little blood to be seen. Which is not to say the fights aren't brutal: Bourne often gets stuck in and works hand-to-hand, with the camera so close it's often difficult to see what's going on. The quick cuts are deliberately disorientating - but not annoyingly so.The film serves up some interesting issues. Who is the real enemy? Where are the safeguards against an unaccountable government? In a 'war against terror', do the ends justify the means?Other movies have touched on similar themes. But what seemed fantastical in 1998's Enemy of the State now seems worryingly more plausible in the post 9/11 era. Particularly, one scene in Ultimatum has eerie parallels with the July 2005 police shooting of a Brazilian electrician at a London underground station, in what turned out to be a calamitous case of mistaken identity.Of course, with any action thriller you have to suspend your disbelief. Fortunately for the screenwriters - and the audience - the frenetic direction doesn't leave much time to pick holes in the plot, although one does wonder at Bourne's miraculous ability to find unbarred windows to leap through in even the most maximum-security installations. Clearly, neither Bourne nor his CIA pursuers seem to believe in the adage 'look before you leap'.And despite producing dispassionate and unemotional operatives via the Treadstone project, the CIA clearly hasn't kept that philosophy for senior management. Straitham's Vosen, in particular, takes every opportunity to make snap decisions in times of crisis rather than first considering his options. Sin in haste, repent at leisure. He doesn't learn.By his nature, Bourne is a loner. There's no romance in the movie, though fellow CIA employee Nicky Parsons (played by Julia Stiles) pops up to give Bourne someone else to look after. Refreshingly, the character of Pamela Landy (played by Joan Allen) gives one female a strong role at least.The soundtrack is functional and unobtrusive, helping pitch the mood without being overly noticeable. And that's the way it should be - there's enough going on already without additional distractions.For a Hollywood blockbuster, Ultimatum is sharp, fast-paced and tight. If you do go and see it, pay attention and enjoy the ride.]"
151,"[You try to summarize what you felt about a film and you are at a loss. The opening sequence was cool (even if inspired), but the fart jokes were well, fart jokes; but that scene between mother and daughter was pretty well-written for a film of this genre, but the film was not paced well; but the climax was one of the best ever, but the songs are all over the place even though they are nice...And so on. That of course is One By Two. It has a chic, Hollywood rom-com feel to it, except that it is Indianized with songs, etc. So, like the ping-pong ball between Amit's (Abhay Deol) mom (Rati Agnihotri) and dad (Jayant Kriplani), you move from a well-done thing about the film to something shrug-worthy and back;  from a witty line/scene to toilet humor; from Amit's story to Samara's (Preeti Desai).However, the one big thing that worked for me is the concept. At about minute twenty, I reminded myself to note down when the lead pair would meet. And then, slowly, as the idea started getting clearer, it got interesting. But - there had to be a but, right? - the two individual stories were more or less boring. What is worse is, it comes across as the writers somehow knew it and to cover it up they added lame humor that didn't belong. The only curiosity left then, was how the two stories would intersect, but unfortunately that is not the point of the film. Samara, a struggling dancer, goes through the regular ups and downs of any story that would have a struggling dancer as a lead character. And yet, its just refreshing to see a woman in a rom-com spend so much on-screen time and energy on something other than a man. Of course, her character could have been written in better detail with all the layers that were exposed to us. Even within the limited scope, her character's relationship with her mother was given one nice, long scene to breathe. If only, it went a little deeper. It doesn't help that Preeti Desai doesn't have a whole range of expressions. This makes your empathy for Samara stand-offish. Amit's story on the other hand is stuck, just stuck, right from the beginning. But, maybe its intentional. The thing about defining your lead character a boring makes him exactly that - boring. And how long can you stick around with a boring character, let alone root for him. And yet, when Amit does the right thing, you give him a pat on his back. When he vents, you are ready for his character graph to do something that gets your interest, but remember? He is stuck. Abhay Deol does Amit's crazy venting bit with ""pakao-ed"" pretty hilariously. But, we didn't really doubt his acting capabilities, did we? What is frustrating is that the entire sequence doesn't fit in the film at all.  Amit is never shown as being frustrated with life in general, but suddenly has this outburst. The outburst makes sense, but not that Amit had it. The side characters do add a little spice to the ongoings, which are bearable to a point. And then they become repetitive. I would like to see more of Preetika Chawla though. And actually, I don't mind seeing more from Devika Bhagat, in the hope that next time, she'll make every thing about her story and the film crisper and tighter.]"
152,"[There couldn't have been a more generic story line.  Replace cricket with any other obsession for the two cricket-crazy characters and the movie would be the same - awful. I assume the movie is named hattrick because there are ""three"" story lines and they have some connection to cricket. There are three threads in the movie - Kunal Kapoor-Rimi Sen; Nana Patekar-Danny Denzongpa; Paresh Rawal with his family. So far so good. Kunal is a huge cricket fan - lame but OK. Danny Denzongpa is bowler turned coach. OK. Paresh Rawal - this is what I think happened here - the writer wrote Paresh Rawal's story; dozed off while struggling to inject some cricket connection in the blank spaces (I wonder why); woke up to find that he had crossed the deadline for submitting it; and submitted what he had. Because the writer was late, the others did not have time to read it and started making the movie as is.I think the most connection this movie had to cricket was the number of advertisements squeezed in - Reebok, Cafe Coffee Day, Starbucks, Tootsies, Kellogg's,  Fedex (and I am sure I missed some). If that is not enough to annoy you, there are the usual extra-bright blues, pinks and oranges you associate with a movie that has no qualms about taking cinematic liberties.Connection between the three threads? Goodness, you guys have no limits to your expectations! They give you three stories (?) instead of one and now you want them to connect?!?Nana Patekar, Paresh Rawal, Danny Denzongpa did what the script asked them to do and therefore no complaints from them, except for taking up the roles in the first place. Then there is Kunal Kapoor for those interested in drooling over muscular physique and Rimi Sen (with an overdose of make-up) for those interested in looking at sexy seducing women. They serve their purpose well by having a tough competition for the who's-going-to-show-more-skin competition? Their performances were mostly loud. Speaking of loud, for the first time ever, I wanted a remote to fast forward the songs. Okay-okay, enough with the negativity. The good thing is, I laughed out loud thrice in the movie and smiled once, so that is 3.5 laughs in less than two hours. Hey, wow! A hattrick and a little more. The other dialogues were...oops, can't remember...well, let's just say very forgettable then - especially the preachy ones in the end. Since I can't seem to control my cynical attitude and have already used more gray matter to write this review than the makers used to make the movie, I shall take your leave until next time.]"
153,"[Jayantabhai Ki Love Story showed very little potential from it's trailers. So, despite all my needs of wanting to watch every film with neutrality, I went in expecting very little, if at all. The best I can say, is that I came out unscathed because of almost zero expectations. The 'bhaigiri' end of Jayantabhai Ki Love Story is unethusiastic and the love story end is stagnant. The film is pretty much flat throughout, except for a little ruffle in the feathers in the name of a climax.So, plain is the love story, that even after Jayanta (Vivek Oberoi) and Simran (Neha Sharma) take the 'big step' as a couple, they go back to their old relationship soon enough. Tiffs vanish and all becomes well, all too soon. Similarly, the underworld track of the film gathers no momentum at all. The conflict that they start doesn't see much change. Both patronage and animosity are superficial. You never figure why one is loyal to another or why they are at another person's throat. It is said so, and thus it should be believed. And the two tracks have very little do with each other. Whatever little intersection exists, is lame enough to be ignored. The rest is filled with slime-balls in the corporate world who seemed to be worse than infamous casting couches or with formulaic songs shot at exotic locations or gratuitous show of cleavage or other such inanity. Amidst the limp stories then, the smart-Aleckry in the dialogue brings in a laugh or two. You can also scoff at the Munnabhai references. Also, because everything else is so devoid of energy, the over-eager performances make you applaud their attempt at putting life into the characters. It is amazing then, that there are producers who willingly go through with such projects. What in Jayantabhai Ki Love Story wasn't told already and which frame had something that wasn't told in a better way elsewhere? You wonder, and only wonder. ]"
154,"[He may be a cop, a thief, a spy, a bodyguard or a buffoon - He's Salman Khan and he'll beat people around him to pulp. He'll do it to the cheers and whistles of his audience. He'll do it with his unique style that you can hate or love, but cannot ignore even if you tried. Oh yes, they try to have a story in Jai Ho which attempts to ignite the human in you.So, here's our good samaritan (yeah, that's how good he is) Jai (Salman Khan) who helps people and wants to spread his idea of goodness. Only that he is hot-tempered, so his help invariably involves violence. A lot of violence. I guess, being a Salman Khan film we should just be thankful that this time around the character he plays isn't looting the rich to help the poor, to give his character that shade of grey. There I go again, looking for work in the writing department in a film of this genre, having this star. However, I did like that they try to propagate the ""do good, feel good"" idea. If only, the movie stuck to it, itself. Unless of course, the idea of a common man beating every criminal in sight - is ""do good"". Aah, now there's an idea. And yet, when a military tanker vandalizes property, it gets a bit much, even if it is out of goodness of the heart, for the goodness of the heart.I must admit though, for a change Jai Ho has more focused writing than any of Salman's recent films. It doesn't deviate from its theme or violence, but for that occasional song and dance number. It doesn't take the romantic detour for too long too. Even the villains want to harass his other family members rather than his love interest. Which is about as good as it gets, for to see Tabu play a side character hurts. She stands tall, she tries to bring composure to the film, she does her bit, but it still hurts. I felt sorry for Genelia D'Souza too. Maybe her character too, but mostly the actor for the length of the character she plays. It is very difficult to no relate it to her post-marriage career. Anyway, lead lady Daisy Shah is the quintessential pretty, dumb love interest who does her bit of cutesy and is ""out of sight, out of mind"" for the other characters, writers, and the audience. The only actor who actually gives a performance-performance is Naman Jain who plays Salman Khan's nephew. Not only is he cute, he is confident and delivers his lines with perfect timing. Also, his role is written well - doesn't make him sound like an adult but at the same time keeping him in line with any boisterous child of this day and age would talk.Otherwise, Jai Ho is the typical mix of action, silly humor, romance, loud background score, and ill-placed mediocre songs. Though, ""baaki sab first class hai"" does have decent lyrics. Too little to hang on to for a film that last 2.5 hours.Throughout the film, I just couldn't shake off the fact that Salman Khan is calling himself a common man. Oh, it's the character that's the common man? Yeah right! Even for the sake of argument, if you ignore that Salman plays Salman in the film, how can you ignore not every common man or a common woman's brother has six packs and muscle power to take down 20 people in one go. And without that, how do we do good and spread the word?]"
155,"[There are at least two terrific things one takes away from David O. Russell's latest. The first is that his terrific ensemble cast, good enough to make you want to watch a film that even starred any one of them, delivers knockout performances without exception. The second, more importantly, is that Russell is slowly beginning to develop a strong, envious filmography; combine this film with his last two - Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter (not to mention one of his much older films, 1999's Three Kings, which makes for a decent, engaging watch) - and he has emerged as a director to always watch out for, here on.He uses his own penchant for crackpot characters that he displayed in Silver Linings Playbook, and adds a dash of Scorsese to it; complete with those familiar voiceovers - except, Russell goes full throttle on the mental with it.If you've watched Scorsese's latest cult classic, this year's The Wolf of Wall Street, you'll be excused for feeling just a wee bit of deja vu, before Russell's twisted, neurotic characters make you get over it quite soon. If  Wolf was about material excess and debauchery, Hustle is all inside the heads of the characters. Based on a true life story of a scam in the 70s, American Hustle revolves around an art scamster played by Christian Bale and his partner Sydney (Amy Adams), who are coerced into participating in a plan hatched by an FBI agent - Bradley Cooper - to bait dishonest Congressmen. Well, that's that. This is the kind of film where the plot matters much lesser than the situations and interactions between the characters. Often unrelated to the larger story, the characters keep getting into actual and metaphorical tangles, as they cope with the cards life deals them.Every crazy character has their own set of crazy desires, and the drama nearly always plays out at high octane hilarity no matter how serious the actual scene at hand is supposed to be in the lives of those in it. This is the crazy America of the '70s, and Russell gives us a quintessentially American film; the land of ultimate, unbridled ambition, and the wherewithall to chase it at all costs.With Bale, Adams, Cooper and the ultra-talented Jennifer Lawrence as Bale's psychotic, passive-aggressive wife, Russell combines the cast of his last two films, and ups the ante with their performances. Bale, in particular, is a marvel. For the casual cinegoer, Christian Bale will probably always be Batman. But if you've watched more of his other work, then it becomes clear that despite doing three Batman films, the character of Batman for him is but an aberration. He is a chameleon, willing to undergo whatever physical transformation it takes to become the character. His pot-belly and waning hair here add such tremendous texture to his overall presence.American Hustle is a long film. At well over two hours, the film meanders and takes its time to go where it wants to. Often, the detours in the screenplay seem like indulgences, even if the scenes stand out themselves. There are too many confrontations, and the film could have done with a better dramatic graph. The sub-plot regarding Christian Bale's and his wife's character - and the effect that his relationship with Adams has on it - seem like it was devoted too much attention.Then again, that could just be me. The film largely keeps you interested; and as I mentioned earlier, the interest extends to when and what David O. Russell has in store for us next. ]"
156,"[Just because a movie is animated and set in a fantasy land doesn't mean it is for kids. But, when you advertise it on kids' TV channels, implies you are targeting them. Then it absolutely peeves me off, the instant you have a central male lead bragging about scoring with 'chicks' in the opening song. It is a sheer letdown that the YRF banner, which usually has decent-sized, significant roles for women, have the two she-characters as mere sidekicks. And the sole function of one is to be wooed by men for her sexiness physical beauty.Nevertheless, the graphic design is certainly one giant leap for Hindi movies. If only the story were too. Even if we forget that dogs are on two-legs, own salons, and dance to sensuous moves at pubs, the basic story is snore-worthy. Not to mention we have seen humans do it countless times. Anyway, one step at a time, I guess. It is sort-of funny when a movie where Aditya Chopra is involved in the writing has references to his earlier movies. Not so when it features in EVERY Yash Raj film. So is this the contract the writer signs at gunpoint? A Yash Raj film has to be mentioned a minimum of 8 times.There shouldn't be a lapse of more than 5 minutes and 45 seconds between references.Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayengehas to come up at least twice.What does the audience know about movies!? Anil Kapoor's character, Lakhan was underestimated in Tashan. He needs more exposure. The villain in your movie has to have his mannerisms.You are not allowed to let the audience forget the real life relationship between the lead pair.So, yeah if you are likely to enjoy another movie full of digs at their own films, this is one you might completely enjoy. Once you have accepted that, the imaginative and smart dialogues keep that smile glued to your face throughout. It was especially hilarious to see the audience hoot when they hear Kareena Kapoor on screen. She sure has a faithful fan following, even if she's playing a bitch! Saif Ali Khan and Jaaved Jaaferi aren't doing anything especially new with their voices. They all just sound a little gruffy, as if the same digitized special effect was layered over their usual voices. I wouldn't want my kids to watch something that implies so much disrespect towards women and is more-or-less story-less. But, they will. And they are most likely going to enjoy it too. Yeah-yeah-yeah, lighten up, diwali hai (it's the festive season)...oh well...]"
157,"[Miss Lovely - takes you into a world you can live without going into - the sleazy world of ""horror"" films that are intended to titillate. A world of two brothers making such films - one who wants to move on to porn films and the other who wants to make a clean, romantic one. It is an uncomfortable ambiance and very intentionally so. Which is fine, only that it overtly tries to go all ""art-house"" cinema on you.Flitting between showing you the behind-the-scenes of B/C grade films and the inner angst of a crew member whose heart isn't into it, Miss Lovely's writing doesn't do justice to either the plot or its characters. Sure, I admit, I am not the biggest fan of B-C-D grade films, so the theme of the film itself isn't as appealing. On the other hand, I am always ready to travel with a character, whatever its background. But, Miss Lovely, denies me that. And that's more frustratingly than usual because it didn't have to do much to hook me in. It has the most brilliant performances and the setting is as real as it gets. It has quirks that catch you smiling wryly at the dark humor. It is commendable indeed, that with a theme such as the porn world, the movie doesn't get too graphic. Given all of that, I am ready to let go of the typical elements the film engages in - the jealous dying ""star"", the clamoring of struggling actors who can stoop to any levels to land a role in a film, and so on.What the writing fails to understand is that with a setting that is far removed from our real worlds, it becomes ever so important to engage the viewer either in the narrative or with the characters. One thing that troubles me with films is when the camera gets over-excited. I understand the hand-held jitters bring out the confusion on screen - both apparent and inner, but the impact on me is lost when its overdone. In fact, in this one the hand-held sequences are done with close-ups that ironically distance you from what's going on in the film. That's the root there, the connect - which isn't there. Certainly a downer, for a film that wants you to experience, rather than just superficially know. Yet, you cannot take away from the fact, that it is brave indeed to make a film like Miss Lovely.]"
158,"[There are seven stages of falling in love claims Dedh Ishqiya. Isn't it beautiful that the director is in love, the writer is in love, the cinematographer is in love, the producer is in love and of course, the actors are in love - with their art? They are almost at the sixth stage - obsession. Lovingly, balancing their act before they go any further towards the climax. And the beauty is they take you along with them, only leaving you behind once in a way. With all its Urdu (I refuse to use any glorifying adjective for Urdu because it just doesn't do justice), poetry and poise, the one thing that strikes the most is its quirkiness. Who would've thought Urdu and quirk would blend so well together. A character who doesn't even have a scene in the film has a quirky dying wish. The contrast doesn't stop here. You have a foul-mouthed Babban (Arshad Warsi), a loud-mouthed Muniya (Huma Qureshi) and wannabe poet (Vijay Raaz) even it out with their everyday speak. Further enhancing these opposites are the subtitles in English. At first annoying, but once the Urdu begins you are grateful for them. And yet, the Urdu isn't completely out there. You can approximate what the not so known words mean from the context. Very likely, the writers took a conscious decision to dumb it down for us. A wise decision which balances between becoming too intelligent for its own good and over-explaining things. There are a couple of spots where they couldn't resist spoon-feeding though and it is jarring when it happens only because it departs from the otherwise painstakingly created regal tone of the film. The rusty, dusty palette against the royal backdrop of a prince's palace is by itself enough to keep you engaged for a good part of the film. The music subtly stays in the background with some soulful lyrics to the songs. This works perfectly for the story that adds layer after layer to itself. I loved the subtle hints at homosexuality - both good and bad. Then, each of the main characters has an angle of his/her own. The build-up to half-time is perfect for the twists that ensue later in the film. Interestingly, even if it is predictable you don't mind it, because it is still different from the norm. Similarly, the wit in the lines, even when predictable is done with words that you don't expect making it fresh. Of course, it helps that you have a cast that insists on topping each other in terms of their charm, comic timing, dialogue delivery and poise as needed. Sure, you will find Madhuri Dixit a little less glamorous and vibrant than she was in her heyday. But the lady is aging gracefully. That beside the role does demand a plastic kind of poise that she carries off with elegance. And when she lets her hair down, she reminds you of her old self.Naseeruddin Shah is lovable as the old fool in love, smitten by his latest ""love of life"". And yet he carries of the shade of gray believably. Arshad Warsi is of course, charming from the word go as a gullible idiot. Huma Qureshi has now mastered the art of being the woman who knows exactly what she wants. Vijay Raaz too is perfect as the villain who is as smitten as our protagonist. All of them - from Madhuri Dixit to Vijay Raaz need more roles like these. For our sakes more than theirs.And for our sake too, if there is a Dhai Ishqiya, I am not sure if I want it to stay at this stage of love - a little less than six out of the full seven. A part of me wants the next installment to go all out and challenge us with zero spoon-feeding. A part of me wants it to stick to this balance.  Why? Well, because the seventh stage is rather deadly. ]"
159,"[For a person who watches at least two films a week in the theaters, including some really bad ones, I admit  it is difficult for films to get me hooked. But, hand-in-hand, it is equally difficult to keep me more than 100% detached from what's going on on screen. Even when my expectations are low, I am on the watch for something to like, something to enjoy. But Yaariyan, manages to even take that away from me. The screenplay is all over the place here. The only clarity it seems to have is that it knows not what to do with itself. It is almost like they used a trial and error method of sticking blocks of story together. That is especially sad considering the individual blocks of story are rather random in the first place. Picture this - Four pretty much good-for-nothing kids in college are picked up to defend the honor the college. Why? While you have given up on finding an answer to that, the principal of the college insists on giving reasons which might as well have not been given. So, they have to compete with some college school in Australia and jingoism follows. The competition continues to be pointless and the worst bit is absolutely disgusting sub-plots lengthen the runtime of the film.If I go about looking for a needle in the hay stack, I would say the only Rakul Preet came across as someone who might be a good actor if given a chance. She's sweet and has a fresh spontaneity about her that I'd like to see more of. And I say this with Deepti Naval and Gulshan Grover in the cast. Then you have a couple of songs the lyrics of which strike a chord, but why would you suffer a film for lyrics?Very rarely, do I say this about a film, but this once I have to - there go two and a half hours of my life. Especially considering the Pune International Film Festival is on. Sigh]"
160,"[How often have you heard someone say something to the effect, ""Oh, but he's an artist. It's okay, they're just like that!"" Sometimes, an artist is seen through a slightly different moral prism than the rest; a struggling artist even more so. A folk singer in Greenwich Village, New York, Llewyn Davis isn't exactly the nicest man in the world. He frequently pisses people off, often takes those close to him for granted, and, sometimes, he also behaves in a manner that can cause him to be described as a particularly unpleasant bodily orifice. And yet, in this beautifully atmospheric film by the Coen brothers - both, visually as well as aurally - you are drawn to him. He's down on his luck, and it seems to be getting worse by the passing day. Forget about knowing where his next paycheck is coming from, the poor fellow doesn't even know where his bed for the night will be; and it's a 60s winter that seems particularly chilly.Inside Llewyn Davis, the film, is like curling up beside a fireplace when it's snowing outside, with a favourite book for company. It's like listening to your favourite ballad on a rainy day. Most of all, especially for a wounded creative soul, it is like antiseptic-dipped cotton; you're not sure if it's hurting you or healing you.When an artist displays or performs an expression of his or her creativity for the first time in front of an audience, the time interval between the end of the performance and the first reaction of a viewer is like an eternity for the artist. That moment, which seems to last forever, is what the Coens capture so beautifully with Inside Llewyn Davis. And they do so while also making you smile almost throughout. How much can a person be pushed? How much failure can he or she take? How difficult is it to hear someone tell you that you aren't good enough? And worse; what if you start believing it yourself? The answers to these question depend on the individual, but they evoke universal emotional responses. Treated the way the Coens usually do, with their dark humour and visual flair, it's like you're on a road trip with Llewyn, and you just want it to last forever.You feel for his music; the pain is all there. Luckily, the film treats us to full songs, mostly performed by the protagonist himself. And what a soundtrack the film has! Calling it soul-stirring would be the most understated cliche in recent times; the Inside Llewyn Davis soundtrack is a haunting little gem.Prior to watching the film, I was a little disappointed that the Coens' usual cinematographer, Roger Deakins, wasn't shooting this film. However, Bruno Delbonnel, who the Coens' have teamed up with this time, doesn't make you miss Deakins once through the entire film. Gorgeously shot, the film creates and maintains a melancholy mood throughout, with a dull green colour tone that alternately makes you feel the warmth of yellow and the cold of blue.It helps that Oscar Isaac is perfect as Llewyn Davis. He creates a character so endearingly flawed that you want to give him a hug for just being. Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund make memorable little appearances, big or small; but the most impressive supporting act of the film comes from an adorable little cat.Joel and Ethan Coen have, for me, one of the best filmographies in cinema. What's heartening to see is that their films seem to be getting more intimate, now, without losing out on what makes a Coen film in the first place. For me, personally, Inside Llewyn Davis struck home; because, as long as you have a sense of humour about it, there's nothing quite like the inside of an artist's head.]"
161,"[No recent film highlights the importance of context and baggage in how a film is received than M. Night Shyamalan's After Earth. If it wasn't enough that the director himself was under fire for previous debacles like The Last Airbender, After Earth is produced and its story was written by Will Smith, with the Hollywood superstar himself playing one of the two lead characters, and his son Jaden Smith essaying the other - a larger-than-life sci-fi father-son story. Then there were reports of how much had been put into making the film a large franchise, and not just one restricted to cinema. Needless to say, the film was perceived as a gloated, indulgent vanity affair, and was near-universally panned on its release earlier this year. There's no doubt that those involved in the making of the film were largely to blame for the negative vibes that the film had all around. But, I also firmly believe that every film deserves at least one more chance - and more so with After Earth, because it barely received even a first chance.Stripped away from all of the pre-release buzz, After Earth still has plenty of flaws, but I couldn't help feeling that perhaps the world had been a tad too harsh on it. Most of the issues with After Earth lie in its suspect screenplay, a cast that loses out a bit in actual performance what it gains in screen presence, and some inconsistent VFX - good in some places, but amateurish in others.Despite the flaws, though, the film isn't entirely unwatchable. It is, after all, a father-son reconciliation story as well as the coming of age tale of a young boy, set in a hostile future world. These themes always find some measure of resonance even when made by inexperienced filmmakers - and one can hardly call Shyamalan that. Couple those with the adventure and action elements and a run-time of just 100 minutes, and After Earth isn't entirely a waste of time.Will Smith plays Cyper Raige - a legendary soldier who is about to retire. His son Kitai Raige has been trying hard to live up to his father's name, but seems to end up short. Their relationship is then tested to the full as they face a danger that they had scarcely imagined.How one wishes that Jaden Smith had inherited some more of the acting skills of his father. With the innocent charm that he had in The Pursuit of Happyness all but gone, he has to rely on genuine performance to make an impact in After Earth, and he doesn't always succeed in his endeavour. It doesn't help that he and his father spend most of the screen time away from each other, communicating wirelessly. He doesn't have the advantage of some of Will Smith's persona rubbing off on him on screen - something that always happens with stars like Smith. The most interesting aspect of the film is how it deals with the concepts of danger and fear - how the former is real, but the latter is merely a state of mind, and can hence be completely avoided. The practical manner in which this forms the crux of the story is actually some ingenious bit of writing. Also, the concept of a planet Earth that has now become not just uninhabitable but hostile towards human beings is another original idea that holds merit. The film suffers because of the visualization of this Earth, and because of one of the usual pitfalls of a futuristic film - showcasing technology that hardly seems to make any logical sense.The problem with After Earth was that it was packaged as an epic. Instead it should have been packaged as an intimate father-son story, with the epic feel coming off naturally, rather than being forced down the audience's throat. The same applies for the DVD as well - the DVD case is just different enough from the usual cases that DVDs come packed in, for the unsuspecting to believe that the film they're holding in their hands is some sort of an epic. The pack is nice, if only the film was better.The contents of the DVD, though, are not disappointing, because of the bonus features. The DVD has three featurettes in it, and each of them give an insight into the making of the film. 'A Father's Legacy' takes a look at Will and Jaden on and off screen, and thankfully it doesn't get too mushy. '1000 years in 300 Seconds' is a rapid behind the scenes look at the film that is brief, but still quite interesting. And lastly, the gorgeous locales where the film was shot are showcased in a featurette titled 'The Nature of the Future'. Mostly for cinephiles, the bonus features of the After Earth DVD are certainly no let down.Another good touch, which I believe should be a must for all DVDs releasing in India, is the regional languages option. This one comes with Hindi, Telugu &amp; Tamil, and also has the option of English or Hindi subtitles. Because the film itself is by no means a 'must watch', the After Earth DVD is hard to recommend strongly. However, for pure academic interest, to discover just how much of the way a film is received by a viewer depends on what the viewer takes in to the film with him, After Earth is a film that one wouldn't particularly mind catching on home video.]"
162,"[We live rather tame lives, if you really think about it. Years of conditioning about what's right and what's wrong; the pangs of guilt or, alternatively, the adrenaline rush one gets when one crosses a moral 'line'; passing moral judgements about the other; penance for one's 'sins'; the works. Humanity lives by a code of ethics that, at least for the most part, seems to work for us.But then, who really writes this 'code'? Who makes the rules, and if we go by the fundamental premise that all of humankind is equal, then who's to say what defines right and wrong in the first place? After all, one man's food is another man's poison. Consequently, there will always be those who live life by their own rules, all notions of morality be damned. These people, usually, are the ones who aren't accountable for their Aston Martins.Enter Jordan Belfort - Wall Street stockbroker and salesman extraordinaire - a man who made millions by laundering fraudulent stocks to unsuspecting investors. A self-styled Robin Hood who took wealth from the rich and gave it to... Himself! A man who made so much money that he didn't mind throwing cash in the trash, just for kicks.Based on the book 'The Wolf of Wall Street' written by the real life Belfort himself, Martin Scorsese's film adaptation of the scamster's life is an astonishingly audacious piece of cinema - both in content as well as execution. With the film largely based on fact, one can't help but be overwhelmed by just how obscene Belfort's greed, depravity, lasciviousness and lust for money was; and that lust just grew bigger with each additional million he made. Jordan Belfort didn't just push the limits of morality, he ignored them completely, seeming to live in an alternate dimension where morality as a concept just didn't exist.Then there's what Martin Scorsese has done with Belfort's story. Call it glorification, call it treating a serious issue with a far lighter tone than can be considered appropriate, or call it sheer masterclass in adopting a cinematic style that will work best with the written word - either way, Scorsese knocks this one out of the park the way only he can.Directed with a kind of fervent energy that one hasn't seen from the great man in a while, The Wolf of Wall Street is cinema on crack. Outrageously funny, incredibly daring in terms of how it never shies away from going deeper and deeper into the realms of 'immorality', briskly paced to the extent that one never realizes its monstrous runtime, and phenomenally performed to boot, The Wolf of Wall Street will either be the most fun you've had at the cinemas in a while, or if the vulgarity of Belfort's excesses begin to get to you, it can also be the most taxing experience in recent times.Because make no mistake, neither Martin Scorsese nor his terrific cast have held themselves back with this one; they've gone all out to bring you characters that make you question everything you believe in. Sex, violence, drugs, language, corruption, immorality and everything considered taboo are actually celebrated with uncontrolled licentiousness in the film. In fact, despite the fact that the film has been released in India with a good six minutes chopped off, I still couldn't help wonder how the censors were mature enough to let the film release at all - not that I'm complaining. It is rated as an adult film, obviously, but I know for a fact that even many 'adults' will find it hard to stomach the level of all-round immodest extravagance of sin that has been depicted in the film.Of the cast, Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort and Jonah Hill as his aide Donnie give their characters their unbridled all. DiCaprio, in particular, must be saluted for pumping Belfort with a quality that makes him seem 'normal', despite his excesses. They should be someone we despise, but we are never allowed to take a moral stance with them. DiCaprio - and Scorsese, of course, - make you an unsuspecting participant in everything that you would ideally consider 'wrong', which consequently shakes you off from your own moral high ground, bringing your self-righteousness crashing down.Questions will be asked, of course. Is it right to glorify something that is so obviously 'wrong'? Should there have been a stronger focus on highlighting that sin must always be atoned for; that karma will come back to bite you in the backside some day? Is a film like The Wolf of Wall Street irresponsible towards society, because it seems to make heroes out of people who should be considered as villains? These are all points of view, which, while important to talk about, actually are a disservice to the intent of the film altogether. Because, whether we like it or not, the world is very clearly run by all the Belforts out there - the ones who are 'more equal' than the others. Scorsese daringly shows us that even these people are human, and by making an enjoyable film out of Belfort's story, he shows us that if we were in Jordan Belfort's shoes, we would probably have been no different. We're all, in some way or the other, wolves in human clothing.]"
163,"[I completely relished the sweet time taken to establish little Tahaan's innocence and his harsh environment. I got fairly involved with the conflict gradually created because he's surrounded by people taking advantage of an 8-year old's gullibility. All this build-up towards a 5-minute climax? So sudden was the en, that people who might've fallen asleep because of the slow pace thus far, might even miss the climax.Yet, it didn't take anything away from a heart-warming performance by Purav Bhandare (Tahaan). The earnestness in his eyes in combination with his character's zeal was inescapable. I've become so used to seeing Anupam Kher in loud comedies, that any non-slapstick from him seems like a huge step in the right direction. So, though not his best, it's certainly one that makes most of the voice modulation he's capable of. This is the first time I've seen Rahul Bose play a non-city-bred character. In fact, he plays a village fool, if not the village fool. I'm still debating whether it's more because of how we are conditioned to see him that he doesn't seem convincing or it is indeed a role that he couldn't carry. Any which way, both the actor and the director need to be complimented for the experimentation. Sarika's grief-stricken eyes left me completely awestruck.And so did the cinematography. Kashmir's Pahalgam - the first time I saw snow and fell in love with it. Looks as beautiful now, as it was then. Only the houses look more rundown, the people seem poorer but have done their best to maintain the warmth inside. I guess visitors have to think twice before they can consider a vacation in Kashmir, where children play military-terrorist with their broken cricket bats. It might be fiction; it might be based on non-fictional situations. Either way, it's believable. Is it so easy to plant bombs? Or is this the film-maker's way of telling the people of Kashmir, ""look at what you're doing to our children"" So, what do I give more weightage to - my disappointment with how the story loses its way or the beautiful photography? Why does it seem like the cinematographer Santosh Sivan took over the reigns from the writer Santosh Sivan? But, director Santosh Sivan seems to have done well with the actors, folk-based background score, art work, styling, and photography, of course. Was the aim to show the condition of Kashmir or to narrate the story of a brave boy? Maybe one through the other. Full points to the former and more than a little dissatisfaction with the latter. I'd give that extra point because the serenity of this one can only be enjoyed on the big screen.]"
164,"[What is my job as a person who's writing her opinion of a film? To let you know how I liked it and why. Sure. But Raavan made me want to warn you. Warn you that though it is not an exhilarating experience, one might have expected it to be, there is a trick you could use to enjoy the film. Don't think of it as drama, or an engaging take on one serious issue or the other. Think of it as a decently-made musical. An opera.Almost everything about the film is poetic. Barring a few places, the cinematography and the background music are fabulous. There are a couple of scenes where the camera goes round and round the character with the sole purpose of making the audience's head spin. Other than that though, you can sense the fog, the dew, the breeze around the characters. The mist adds to the lyrical photography. Similarly, save a few spots, the background music is extremely different and covers a HUGE range of music. My understanding of music is pretty basic, but I loved the use of folk/tribal music. Also, using different types of music for different characters and situations was not only noticeable but rather lovely. How I wish we could get complete OSTs of our films. But like love can't finance your materialistic needs, a technically beautiful film can contribute only so much to making the film ""good"". The culprits here are the pace and narrative style of the film. The key word in that previous statement is 'style'. In his attempt to make the tough terrain visually suave, Mani Ratnam forgot the K-I-S-S principle. The montage that the film starts out with is truly breathtaking. Without saying a word, a few situations and characters are established. But, it doesn't remain that smart throughout. In fact, there is a huge slack-off period before the climax-with-great-potential. The dilemma is wonderfully created by a statement that the film is trying to make, ""In every Ram there's a Raavan and vice versa."" All too sudden and too late. Nothing is made out of it. Also, there wasn't time left to delve into the details. ow which one was the cause and which one the effect, I do not know. All I know is that I was saddened to see super-gray characters killed because of hollow writing. Given that and the decision to make the film as close to a theatrical performance (hopefully intentional), the cast section should have been titled over-actors. Govinda brings that occasional smile. I never thought the prettiest human, nature must have created, Aishwarya Rai, was any good as an actor. But Abhishek Bachchan films always attracted me towards them. This film has made me reconsider him as an actor. It was uber-annoying to see him stylishly walk like he walked in Bluffmaster.And despite all of the above, there are times when you are made to think. Especially when compared to the ages-old epic. It occurred to me that the agni pariksha was not only an insult to Sita's honor but also offensive to Raavan's virtuousness. And did Laxman just cut Surpankha's nose, or that was the metaphor we have been conditioned to ignore? Oh, the blasphemy! While it's pretty neat that the film does give these things to ponder about it also gives as bonus the agony of having to wait even longer for a film I can highly recommend.  sigh ]"
165,"[""How did you do it?"" A question every magician takes pride in not answering. Of course, Dhoom 3's magician, Saahir (Aamir Khan) is asked that too, but as an audience it peaked my interest only half-heartedly. Mainly because It is a tad predictable despite being indigestible. Two things in a movie that I have very little patience for - predictability and implausibility.But, then again, Dhoom 3 has Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra trying to pull off Rajni-style stunts. How much more meta can unbelievability get? To their credit they do their best in bringing out laughter, whether well-meant or not is a matter of 'to each his own'. I did feel like observing a two minute silence in mourning as I saw Uday Chopra get a better role as comic relief than Abhishek Bachchan as sidekick. Oh well. But then again, with Aamir Khan around every one is a sidekick. So, Aamir Khan does his bit with an intense look persistently on his face for the first half of the film. It is annoying, but then again I walked in expecting that. But pleasantly, he shifts gears in the second half and actually pulls off his role very cleverly. That leaves Ms. Kaif to start with some ""Indian Goddess song and dance"" thing. It does so happen that her role is a little more than just that. Just about enough for the feminist in me to not say, ""she was used as a prop."" Even so, the performance itself doesn't require any great emotion. Anyway, what place does emotion have in an action flick, other than superficial.And superficially infused it is, the romance, the dedication a son has for his father, the revenge - all of them seem to just be fillers in what the movie is really meant for - action. The action sequences themselves are some shoddy, some pretty neat, all of it inspired from something we have seen elsewhere. Yet, for those of us who haven't seen too many action films, some bits can be a new experience. Similarly, the story will not be a new experience for anyone who has seen The Prestige. And for those people the comparison will be equivalent to blasphemy - what Ghajini was to [Memento}(http://wogma.com/article/my-favorite-movies/ ""Memento Review""), Dhoom 3 is to The Prestige.I just don't understand how the audience is expected to look over the fact that Dhoom 3 is nothing but a 3 hour long chase sequence with not just enough thrills. To add fuel to fire, what the makers thought as important is repeated and in slo-mo for effect. Sigh.And yet, I wouldn't be surprised at all if Dhoom 3 finds its share of takers and more. sigh again]"
166,"[Good news - no devastating damage done (to put things in perspective, this is the guy who starred in Aap kaa Suroor)Bad news - We saw this almost 25 years ago and can watch it again at home any time we like!Then, pray tell us, why would we want to see Himessss-bhai instead of chintu-mama?It's going to be claimed that the target is not the multiplex cine-goer but the ""masses"". Tell me, which section enjoys Himesh fainting down like every other pregnant woman in Hindi movies? And which section is going to be mesmerized by Urmila's fairy-tale-like vampish gait?Character sketches in movies like these are just amazing. For instance, the woman is given such an important place in the story line...after all our man is completely and unquestioningly smitten by her...and yet her function is less than that of a prop. She just exists. It must be some sort-of an art to make the object of 'true love' a bystander whose primary function is to lick ice-creams and go on a soft toy fetish. Damn, she doesn't even bother to offer support when the man of her life has disclosed the inner turmoil he's going through!In the 80's we thoroughly enjoyed if not thrived on the cinematic liberties taken. But hasn't the audience matured at least a bit since then? Even if each and every character, in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer, in Karzzzz have the best anti-aging cosmetics at their disposal. You are helpfully given 'then and now' transitions of brand ambassador Urmila Matondkar as proof. None of the characters manage an extra wrinkle, or an extra inch. I want whatever they are having!Oh, by the way, if you were thinking the makers were ingenious enough to only take from one movie made previously, get set to be proven wrong. Kabira (Danny Denzongpa) is given only lines from old Hindi movies to fit the particular situation. They are relevant enough so, it doesn't become painful. Though every time someone said ""kudrat ka karishma"" (nature's freak miracle), I felt like saying, ""not really, it happened more than 25 years ago (if not earlier).""And then you have the blatant references to Deewar, Shaan, Mr. India. Not to mention the mimicry artist of a villain, bad man, Gulshan Grover doing a Feroze Khan-cum-Shaakal look. Of course, borrowing neither stops at dialogues nor at old Hindi movies. The songs are all seen there, heard that. No-no, I'm not referring to ""ek haseena thi"" or the signature tune from the original. (Although, the man actually sounds good when other voice-producing organs overpower the mighty nose!) I'm referring to the first song (""ishq is duniya mein"") that sounds like Himesh's compositions from earlier movies. And the second, third, and so on numbers which sound like the first. So, we actually have borrowing from the latest movie!The camerawork, background score etc. do try to give the movie a slick look - what with the action choreographer going for the home run with Himesh flying through a mansion. And however smart you make the movie look when it's about reincarnation, then the half-hearted attempt at logic/logistics in the climax makes you laugh only harder.One argument could be that if Karz is likeable what's wrong with Karzzzz? It's the same story after all. But somehow, the balance tilts against a Himesh Reshammiya being snickered at by most members of the audience every time he attempts emotion.]"
167,"[Disclaimer time. Park Chan-wook's Oldboy ranks amongst my favourite films of all time, because it deals with my favourite themes - revenge, guilt and death, and because Park made a gritty, visceral yet stylish film that didn't shy away from pushing violence, sex and strong sexual themes to places they hadn't been to. Obviously, any remake of a film that one loves so much is awaited for with a strange mix of excitement and trepidation.Add to that the fact that the remake was being helmed by the director of Inside Man - a highly underrated film, in my opinion; so yes, Spike Lee's Oldboy was keenly awaited, despite it being a remake of a film that, in an ideal world, shouldn't be touched. Unfortunately - and this is a problem with most remakes - Lee's adaptation is a miss, because it just doesn't seem to capture the soul of the original.Surprisingly enough, even Sanjay Gupta's Zinda, a faithful 'tribute' - to put it politely - was a stylized, if heavily watered-down version of it, was actually a wee bit more intriguing than what Lee has given us.Even if you haven't already watched the original or the Hindi remake, you'll probably already know that the film is about a man who is, without reason, held captive for a long, long period of time, and is then, as mysteriously, released. Except, the man is now angry. And he wants answers.Even attempting to judge this film all by itself, independent of the original, one can't help see right from the start how flawed the very approach to the film is. The protagonist, Joe Doucett, is presented to us as a man with questionable morals. Not 'grey', mind you, which every human being is - but more 'charcoal', if you will. That automatically makes you not particularly care for him when he's imprisoned.Also, Joe is imprisoned during a period where humankind has seen the kind of change - be it in lifestyle or in technology - that has been unprecedented. Thus, when he steps out, the world should appear so alien to him that his disorientation should be a fundamental part of his personality. Instead of using this as an obvious character attribute, all we get are hints that Joe is unaware of Google and touchscreens.He, however, seems to be quite adept at cracking the answers to questions that, logically, he shouldn't even know to ask. Another important aspect that the film fails to get even close to right is how Joe's physical and emotional transformation must be, during and after the length of his captivity. Park's Oh Dae-Su goes from an almost-portly man approaching middle-age, to a lean fighting machine, because the wish for revenge drives that in him. You can feel that physical transformation; you can feel that burning desire for revenge. Everything in Spike Lee's remake is superficial - the emotions, Joe's journey and his quest for answers, Josh Brolin's interpretation of Joe, all of it.If there is one area, however, where this film manages to be different yet equal to the original, it is in the post-climactic resolution. Lee's ending is significantly more plausible than Park's. Then again, Park's film was all about audacity. It is almost worthy of a case study, how the exact same plot can seem audaciously original and nerve-wracking for one film, and cloyingly far-fetched for another.Brolin tries hard as Joe, but he's ultimately always Brolin. Elizabeth Olsen, who's been out of sight for a while, is refreshing as Marie, Joe's unlikely companion on his quest for answers. She looks simple yet lovely, and it also seems like she has finally learnt how to step out of the cutesy Michelle we've always known her as, and slip into a real adult character. Sharlto Copley, seen earlier this year as one of the antagonists in Elysium, seems quite adept at playing the manic villain, even though his isn't a significant value addition to this film.It doesn't help at all that the Indian censors have clearly mutilated the film as well. A lot of the violence and sex scenes have been chopped off, and though there is still a substantial amount of those in the film, the bits that have been cut were portions that truly held the emotional crux of the story. But, really, even including those wouldn't have been able to substantially lift what is essentially a mediocre, disappointing film. The next time Hollywood wants to attempt a remake of an Asian thriller, they should just check with Martin Scorsese on how it is done, first. ]"
168,"[Strange that just a year ago, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was easily the most awaited film of the year, while the second film of the trilogy, The Desolation of Smaug, has arrived with not more than a whimper in comparison. Luckily, the film more than lives up to the promise shown by the first film, which, while being an engaging visual and emotional experience in itself, was more of a set up piece than anything else. What is it about watching a bunch of souls on a dangerous quest for something that they believe in, the moral questions behind it be damned? What is it about the most basic concepts like courage, brotherhood, good and evil, which make a well-told story involving them become so immersive?Yes, the Tolkien adaptations have the advantage of being adequately armed with fodder for spectacularly inviting imagery, but surely that can't be all? Surely it is more about the emotions evoked than about breathtakingly executed visuals? This time, we rejoin Gandalf, Bilbo, Thorin and his band of Dwarves - less merrier this time round - as they continue on their quest that began in the previous film. Their destination, of course, is Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, where lies the great dreaded dragon, Smaug. Their journey, however, is fraught with peril.What makes The Desolation of Smaug so much more engaging is that it is far darker than An Unexpected Journey, which actually had so much of understated humour in it. It also is far quicker paced, and it completely ups the action and adventure set pieces; so much that the first film actually seems rather tame in comparison.Watch out, in particular, for one terrific, high-octane sequence involving Orcs, Elves, Dwarves and a raging river. It is easily one of the most jaw-droppingly imagined action scenes of the year - even better than the one where Wolverine had a bit of fun on the top of a Bullet Train earlier this year. This scene, and indeed, so many others in the film, make your heart surge quite like the river that was mentioned earlier. It helps that the 3D this time is even better. What remains to be seen is how this film looks in HFR.The Desolation of Smaug also takes a lot more liberties with the source material than the previous film, but then that's something for only hardcore Tolkien fans to talk about. As far as it being the intermediate film in the trilogy goes, it is a bit of a roller coaster, giving you almost no time to breathe as the Dwarves and Bilbo hurtle towards their showdown with Smaug.And when Smaug is finally shown in all his glory; well, what can one say? Superbly voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, Smaug the dragon has been designed and executed with such persona and awe that it is hard to take your eyes off him. If Gandalf and Thorin were the scene-stealers in An Unexpected Journey, The Desolation of Smaug belongs to Smaug.It won't be surprising, however, if the film manages to exhaust at least some part of the audience. The fact remains that it hardly ever eases up on the action, and most of the action scenes are quite long as well. The film, despite its fast pace, would have been far more appreciated if it was shorter - at least a couple of action scenes chopped out would surely not have hurt. While I'm personally not complaining - l loved every bit of the high energy portions of the film - it would have perhaps made more sense for the film to be slightly less bloated with all that action. Remember, Jackson has already been under fire for making a relatively tiny book into three whole films. Luckily, the film ends on a high - you're left with bated breath for the final chapter of the trilogy. Danger is brewing in Middle Earth, and The Desolation of Smaug literally leave you right at the brink of it. If Peter Jackson now intends to take the adventure up a notch, then The Hobbit: There and Back Again is poised to be a true epic. * Update: HFR Viewing This time round, Peter Jackson and Co seem to have taken cognizance of and fixed at least some of the issues that An Unexpected Journey had with its HFR. In The Desolation of Smaug, the 'fakeness', which was a major complaint about the look of the first film, has actually gone down. That TV-like quality because of the sharpness and smooth frame rate is also lesser. And of course, the big plus point of HFR - better visibility in fast action scenes - works well for this film, which has enough action going for it. All in all, HFR isn't quite perfect yet, but baby steps are being made, in case filmmakers are serious about it as a long-term technical innovation in cinema.]"
169,"[What a hero Katniss Everdeen is! She's bold, fearless, righteous and talented; she's also rash, impulsive and unsure. A heady cocktail of grey and white, she's the kind of hero our cinema has sorely lacked. She also reminds us of what a pity it is that we've had so few genuine female heroes in the fiction of our times. Yes, the situations around her often seem conveniently conducive for her heroism to thrive. And yet, one can't help rooting for her, because she's that rare protagonist whose conflicts often mirror our own. Mostly though, it is the sight of her relishing a challenge that truly makes her a delight.Catching Fire takes off from 2012's The Hunger Games, based on the continuing novel by Suzanne Collins. After the 74th Hunger Games that saw Katniss and Peeta emerge as joint winners at the end of the previous film, the pair are now celebrities in all of Panem. President Snow, however, also notices that young Katniss - monickered 'The Girl on Fire' - is also beginning to become a symbol of rebellion against The Capitol; a spark that must be quelled before it becomes a raging fire.With a change of guard at the helm - Francis Lawrence takes over as director for the remainder of the series - Catching Fire seems grittier than the first film. Life in Panem seems more grim, and consequently, the need for a rebellion seems stronger than ever. Simultaneously, the conflict in Katniss's personal life seems to go hand in hand with the unrest in Panem. She doesn't want the two to intersect, and yet, life has placed her at a juncture where the two are nearly one and the same. She's the beacon of hope that the oppressed need to rally around, when all she wants is to be away from it all, with her family and love.Around all of this, the lavish, obnoxious decadence of those in power, and the gloomy existence of those without it, is brought into sharp contrast - at times a little stronger than is completely necessary. The alternating orgy of colour and dull blue-grey monochrome does have its intended effect, despite its obviousness.The film turns particularly thrilling in its final act - the 75th Hunger Games - which truly takes what we saw in the previous film to a new level; absolute mayhem that keeps you on the edge. Even if, like in the previous film, a lot happens that makes things conveniently easy for Katniss and Peeta. This was one of the problems I had with the first film as well, but it unfortunately seems the kind of liberty the writers and director don't seem to want to take stock of.Catching Fire also has a soundtrack that builds mood and tension throughout the film, all the way till the end credits, which have a few nice tracks that play all along till the end of the roll.Expectedly, Jennifer Lawrence aces it once again as Katniss Everdeen. Fresh from all of the media attention, adulation and that Academy Award for her flakier-than-snow Tiffany in Silver Linings Playbook, the spunky actress just dons Katniss like she and the character were never apart all this while. Josh Hutcherson, meanwhile, has grown well into the character of Peeta, seeming far more confident this time. The supporting cast - Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutherland in particular - manage to make their respective characters and their strong traits stand out. The excellent Phillip Seymour Hoffman joins the cast of the film, and what a presence he is. His character is one of the most intriguing in the series now, and is likely to play an important role ahead.But mostly, Catching Fire works because it does what an intermediate film in a series must do - it takes things up a notch from the first film, and it sets things up nicely for the next one. And it does so while also being a sharp, emotional and thrilling film all by itself. This, really, is how you light a spark.]"
170,"[You have settled down in life, your kids are doing well for themselves. You are all set to enjoy life carefree. And boom life hits you. You are asked to come-of-age all over again. Club 60 might come across as a film of one such man, but it also goes on to tell you that he, his troubles and tragedy not that unique after all. Just like when you look around, you see that like you, everyone has problems. They just choose to deal with them differently. There is something very delightful about films that take on topics related to the elderly - not the glamorous Baghbaan way, but more like the Listen Amaya way. Especially, when you have charming actors like Farouque Shaikh and Sarika play the lead roles. Not only do they make the characters believable, but they make you care for them. And even if that should be the norm, we know it is very difficult to come by in Hindi films. Yet again, Sarika does that one scene which completely bowls you over and brings a lump to the throat and more. I now look forward to every film that Farouque Shaikh chooses to do, because the films by themselves are interesting. And as unfair as it may sound, he could sleepwalk through his role as Taariq in Club 60. Raghuveer Yadav plays his Munna bhai with great finesses. While playing a sleazeball must be one of the easiest in an actor's range of talent, playing a sleazeball who convinces you that he is good-naturedly so right from the first scene has to be a rare one. And it doesn't come across as inconsistent at all.And yet these performances are not the best thing about Club 60. A pleasant surprise are Sharat Saxena and Tinu Anand. The characters they play could easily have become caricatures. Yet, that is avoided with finesse and you see them go through their highs and lows with unexpected grace and dignity. So much so that a fine performance by Satish Shah is side-lined. Where Club 60 suffers then - other than the low-budget-induced-production-values - is the writing. It gets a little repetitive, and the film stretches out a good 15-20 minutes too long. The situations created for each of the characters becomes a tad stereotypical. Even so, you cannot help but want to know more about them because you've grown to care for them. They do remind you of your parents and their group of friends. Alas, the climax is a little too dramatized and drastic for the tone the film maintains through the first two hours. For many, the film might be a good enough on TV watch, but I just couldn't help giving it an extra nudge for the heart it takes to make a film like this. One which takes an understanding, even if a slightly patronizing, look at the generation that's over the hill. ]"
171,"[Love conquers all. Or does it? Whether it does or not, do you care? At least R...Rajkumar doesn't make you.   It makes you feel love and romance is just a means to meet the end of making an action film with Shahid Kapoor as the star. Shahid Kapoor does make the most of it though. His comic timing as required for a film of this nature is decent, and he does his best to emote anger, fatigue, worry and the rest too. Unfortunately, the comic lines are either over-writtent to sound way too ""filmy"" or are inane. Similarly, Sonakshi Sinha lands herself in another role which requires her to play second fiddle to the male lead. Though her introduciton on screen with a fight sequence makes you believe that this one might just have some meat for her. You see glimpses of variety that she can do, but it is too little and certainly disheartening after what we saw her do with Lootera. Yes, I know, I am still stuck there. That aside, you have Sonu Sood with a lot of brawn. It's very interesting that R...Rajkumar, a film that clearly wants to hit the masala film lover in you, has a villain who is better looking that the lead pair put together. Considering that I have spent three paragraphs on the actors, it is safe to assume that there is very little to talk about in the other departments. The writing least of all. It certainly didn't have material to be stretched into a screenplay of 2.5 hours. I must say though, for the flat and unimaginatively predictable overall plot it does manage to bring in an unanticipated turn of events. But not to worry, it goes back to being as was expected in five minutes. There is a lot of action packed in too. Some of it is even a little innovative at the beginning. But, the purpose is so masked and the killings so random that you can stay amused only so much. Add slo-mo and close-ups and you have tuned me off. Of course, that means the cinematography is dramatic and the background music loud as is associated with any film of this genre. That then leaves the music department, which well, might have foot-tapping material, but the lyrics are outright awful. And somehow awful lyrics almost always translate to sleazy dances by women. Yet, I wouldn't like to take away anything from all the heart that Shahid Kapoor puts in the dances. The choreography is mind-bogglingly complicated, as they are in any Prabhu Deva film. Also, those too become repetitive and eventually dry up. Not to mention, as usual, there is nothing graceful about dances set up by him. In that sense then, R...Rajkumar is exactly what you expected it to be. If not as a Prabhu Deva film, as a film that aspires to entertain with masala. And yet, the house was full, with equally enthusiastic whistles and hooting at Shahid Kapoor, Sonakshi and Sonu Sood. Correct, I don't understand this world. ]"
172,"[I remember Minnale (Lightning) being the first Tamil film I attempted to watch without subtitles. I'll be honest and tell you the only reason I did it is because I've seen the Hindi remake some 100 times (Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein). My heroic act fell flat with fervor with a fellow Tamilian friend's wise words - ""I hope you're not watching a Gautam Menon film without subtitles. Half the movie is English anyway.""There's a point behind me bringing out this incident - Gautam Menon is household name now in most parts of South India with films like Kakka Kakka, VinnaiThandi Varuvaya and Varanam Aayiram. His films work because they have a certain universal quality to it, but they still manage to retain the socio-cultural flavor of his roots. Minnale, however, is very different from his later films, which have strong themes and hard-cutting performances. It's a simple, run-off-the-mill story about a guy who tries to woo a girl he saw once and fell in love with. One of Madhavan's earlier films, in Minnale, he plays his most charming role. Genuinely smitten by Reena (Reemma Sen), he convinces you about his mad love, while the camera runs up and down with him on a road, like a love-struck maniac and even more so, when he wants to pull his hair out because he's ""whipped"", to put it colloquially. This portrayal works because, for a film released in 2000, for once we see romance staying away from cheesy songs with loud expressions. This is achieved mainly because every performance, by Madhavan, Reemma or Aabas is believable and fresh. Through the film you feel like you're listening to a ""how-this-happened"" story that a friend tells you over coffee while you're catching up after years. It brings that bright smile of anticipation on your face - as you see the film unfold. Personally, I would have preferred a heroine with a brighter face than Reemma Sen. She just has the tendency to look bored sometimes. Madhavan's witty grandfather Subunni (Nagesh) plays a charming performance as a father figure who supports his feelings with full rigour. Madhavan's best friend Chokalingam (Vivek) adds a sense of comic relief, something that is central to most South Indian films. The music of the film tells half the story, really. Harris Jayaraj's first film as a composer is probably his best soundtrack till date. The songs are heart-warming, hummable and go so well with the flavor of the film. The entire package makes you want to wish you were the lead couple, so you could be a part of a romance that is so next-door. When I first picked up the DVD of Minnale, I was a bit alert. While the DVD has no feature as such, after having heard so many people praise a film that was a dud in Hindi, I wanted to mentally compare. Technically, the subtitles in the DVD are comprehensible (yes, I checked) and they help in making you see a sense of purity that the film has incorporated. Simply put, Minnale blew me away. It's simple, charming and much unlike its Hindi counterpart which borders on a corny, watered down version of the film. Minnale, however, has a very strong personality as a film - like an old, yellowed letter you find written with a blunt pencil. It doesn't matter what language is being used, if you focus you'll read into a pristine love story that dominated somebody's life. Much like a stroke of lightening; it happens to you only once. ]"
173,"[It is a Tigmanshu Dhulia masala film. So, it is as Tigmanshu Dhulia as other Tigmanshu Dhulia films. And it is as masala as other masala films. Which means you don't get anything new and a hotchpotch of a combination. You have an earthy, stylish element to the film which tries to keep the film outside the urban, polished looks associated with Saif Ali Khan (yes, yes except Omkara, of course). And this style starts out with a bang, at the opening credits itself. Some of the most slickly done work while keeping it rugged too. The film itself, begins well after the opening too. Except for an abrupt and badly edited opening sequence, the film sets a nice tone of friendship between Raja (Saif Ali Khan) and Rudra (Jimmy Sheirgill). The camaraderie is cute and yet, has a rugged kind of strength about it. But, unfortunately, the writing doesn't hold as the movie progresses. It is just one big enemy after the other, gun fights and more fights, till you are immune to it all.There are breaks in  the form of one-liners - some witty, some not so much - all of them delivered as if it were to become the most iconic dialogue of the decade. Yes, it does translate either to whistles or eye-rolls, depending on your ""filmy"" appetite. The other breaks come in the form of songs that you wish didn't exist, let alone show up randomly in the film and be just plain awful. Mahie Gill in ""Don't touch my body..."" made me so uncomfortable; didn't help that I was sitting between two men who were strangers. It has as much to do with her costume, her moves, the lyrics, the men letching at her on screen as it is with the setting - a number like that set in a wedding as entertainment for the groom and his friends and family; out in the open; in broad daylight! It just felt wrong.Once you are past that though, there isn't much offensive in terms of vulgarity. There are religious remarks and some social ones too. The social comments take guise under patriotism and Robin-Hood-ism, but come across as sides. They show up rather abruptly. The editing too is rather abrupt especially in some of the action sequences. Many, in fact come across as rather amateur execution. It is a shame since the action choreography is pretty cool, even if in spots. The only thing going for the film then is the performances or rather the screen presence of the main players. Except for Raja and Rudra, none of the other characters have the writing going for them. The two other lead actors then, Sonakshi Sinha and Vidyut Jamwal come too late in the film and/or have little to do to really deserve a fair comment on performances. Saif Ali Khan and Jimmy Sheirgill on the other hand make the most of the rustic roles they are given and it is a pleasure to see them in this setting. Though, thinking of them as simple, men who want to earn an honest living after the first action sequence is hard to digest. But, anyway, it is irrelevant to what happens in the rest of the film.Ultimately, though, there are only so many revenge films one can watch which offer no variety at all. A couple of smart lines here and there don't cut the deal. Especially when almost everything else is sub-par. ]"
174,"[Unbelievable, really. Barely a few months after Antoine Fuqua's Gerard Butler-starrer, Olympus Has Fallen, disgraced the big screen with its cheesy, jingoistic, all-American, guiltily indulgent ludicrousness, Roland Emmerich gives us White House Down - a film with, yes, almost the exact same plot, just with the asininity up several notches. The White House is taken over by terrorists, as simple as that. At least Olympus Has Fallen tried to maintain a level of respect towards the constitution and the office of the President of the United States of America. White House Down, though, is all-out idiocy of an astonishing level. It dials up absolutely everything idiotic about Olympus, adds in more than a few puerile moments of its own, and serves us a harebrained film that trips over its own preposterousness while trying to outrun its own half-wittedness. This is the kind of film where a lollipop-sucking computer hacker gets to work only after setting up a Beethoven symphony, and where an affable White House tour guide miraculously manages to invoke Arnold Schwarzenegger when a shotgun comes his way. Now Roland Emmerich has never been known to make particularly intelligent films anyway, preferring to use his $100-million-plus budgets to blow things up or making things come crashing down. Incidentally, with his last film Anonymous, made on a measly $30 million budget, it seemed like he was beginning to tilt slightly towards some substance in his films. That one was, for me, his best film to date despite it being just as outlandish as his usual work. But he's back with big-budget vengeance and how! Channeling his inner Abbas &amp; Mastan, Emmerich packs the plot in with a twist a minute, completely avoids any space-time coherence, provides ace military-grade stealth skills to an eleven-year old girl, takes special care to ensure that none of the thousand-odd bullets fired at our heroes ever touches them and packs the film with inane humour throughout its runtime; so much so that I'm hard-pressed to not slot this film as a comedy. It also pretends to be a coming of paternal-age drama at times, and it is here when it becomes particularly hard to not gag.The real travesty of this film is how some really fine actors are given such thankless characters to enact. Jamie Foxx as POTUS collects every ounce of Barack Obama's poise and statesmanship, so that he can chew it all up like a giant bubblegum and spit it out onto the front lawn of the White House, ensuring that he carries absolutely none of it into the film. He'd have made for an amusing sidekick janitor at the White House in another film. As the 'leader of the free world' though - as he once refers to himself in this one - he does best when he isn't on screen.Jason Clarke, coming off the back of three terrific turns in Lawless, Zero Dark Thirty and The Great Gatsby, is saddled with a negative role far beneath his talent and presence. Maggie Gyllenhaal goes so over-the-top that you wish more than once that she had stayed dead after The Dark Knight. Channing Tatum as an aspiring Secret Service agent who's trying his best to impress his daughter, offers up a measure of macho schoolboy charm, but there is only so much he can do to keep a straight face during all of what's happening around him.White House Down is the kind of film that you stop taking seriously very soon, hoping that it will turn out to at least be a brisk, fun film. Alas, it rarely becomes anything more than a good exercise at testing just how many synonyms of the word 'moronic' you can think of.]"
175,"[Men will be boys will be men. Will be boys. No matter how old a man gets, he's never old enough to have a spot of fun, even if life catches up with him sometimes. In Jon Turteltaub's Last Vegas, four 'boys' in their late sixties decide to get together and have some fun in Las Vegas, because, obviously, the last of them is about to get hitched.If The Hangover didn't end at the trilogy and went on and on and on, then in a few decades, you'd end up with Last Vegas; it is as easy a film to dismiss as it is to warm up to. What keeps it going is some honest camaraderie between the film's four lead characters, and some clean humour that never transgresses into 'haha' territory. (By clean, I don't mean sexually, because there's a lot of 'guy' humour, sexual innuendo and the likes, in the film. But clean in just the way that there seems to be no malintent in the way the film attempts to charm its audience.)Archie, Paddy, Sam and Billy have been friends for 60 years now, and they still share the same bond as they had as teenagers, even if some of them have had their ups and downs along the way. All said and done, they stand up for each other when the time comes.Each has their own issues in life, be it physically or emotionally. And this trip is, in a way, cathartic for them. Each of them enters as a different person, and for better or for worse, leaves a different man - and that's pretty much what the film is supposed to symbolize for each character - a snapshot of their own personal journeys with their best friends for company.Treated with a continuous stream of humour that has largely to do with their ages, the film doesn't have to try too hard to make you smile. The dialogue is never downright hilarious, often relying on just goody charm more than anything else. That, the veteran actors and their respective characters' quirks are enough to ensure that the film succeeds in being the frothy, breezy watch that it is meant to be. There are the occasional leaps of faith that the film expects you to take, but you don't mind them because it is all meant in good fun.The writing is nearly always predictable, and Turteltaub's direction isn't much more than functional. This is where the four veterans come in to save the day. Make no mistake, none of them is particularly outstanding in their roles. Just that these are men who've been doing this for years. The material doesn't challenge them one bit, and their natural talent and timing does exactly what is required to make it work.Kevin Kline steals the show as the adorable Sam, who has taken 'permission' from his wife for some hanky panky, if he is so lucky. Michael Douglas plays Billy, who is, well, pretty much Michael Douglas; suave, sexy rich bloke who's marrying a woman half his age. Two of my absolute all-time favourite actors - Morgan Freeman and Robert De Niro - seem to have made it their lives' mission to pick films and characters that aren't worthy of them. Last Vegas joins that list, but not before they each have at least a couple of scenes that genuinely make you smile, just because it is them.  The boys ensure that Last Vegas is watchable, and more so because it has become much easier to accept Hollywood mediocrity as long as it isn't a big franchise film. Last Vegas isn't an absolute must watch, but watching four grown boys have a bit of fun isn't particularly a bad way to spend a couple of hours either.]"
176,"[One (wo)man can make a difference. And if there happens to be a man who is in love with her and is willing to give it his all, nothing like it. That's how, dear friend, you come upon a romantic comedy that takes up social causes. Putting it this way, might be a little unfair, belittling the larger purpose of the film too. But then the dry and functional manner in which events take place do not get you involved at all.Starting from the basics, a romantic film has to be able to convey that the couple is in love with each other. Just by pointing out an age difference, the matter isn't taken care of, is it? Doesn't the audience need to be convinced that they love each other? Some chemistry other than a superficial ""good deed""? Superficial - that is the word that comes to mind through the film - be it the romance, the comedy or the social causes that our lady, Dia (Kareena Kapoor) takes up. By the end, almost every thing that happens earlier comes across as a set-up. Any joke made, anything negative or positive said ties up neatly in the end to either be related back to or reversed in a very contrived fashion. Given that the dialogue and comic lines work very briefly and you have seen most of them in the trailer, you are left with the actual cause taken up by Dia. That and how the situation is handled could have been an engaging affair. But well, it gets repetitive and was anyway predictable from the word go. With way too many songs in the beginning and an avoidable narrative thread to the film, Gori Tere Pyaar Mein is also too long. Sure, the narrator is also used as an alter ego, but it just makes the transition, well, superficial. :)It doesn't help that Kareena Kapoor wears designer outfits even when she's staying in a remote village in Gujrat. I guess we should just be thankful that she repeats the outfits. The only silver lining, however, is that Kareena Kapoor gives a decent performance. Imran Khan is his usual self - doesn't impress but doesn't annoy either.  The cast in the Gujrat village though were refreshingly at home. From the little boy to the village head, they all added to the ambiance of the village.Yet again, a romantic comedy that is underwhelming. At least, in this case we didn't expect any different. ]"
177,"[Doesn't it actually feel like every actor needs to have an action film in which he/she is the honest and/or do-gooder fighting against the corrupt system? Actually, it is more specific than that. It is like every actor should have a film like this with Prakash Raj as the villain. So, Singh Saab The Great adds Sunny Deol's name to the list. As expected, it is loud and gets louder by the minute. And there are entire 150 of those, no less. I must say the slight twist in the concept is interesting but they give up on it even before the audience begins to appreciate it. Other than that though, it is as run-of-the-mill and tedious as it gets. The action choreographer tries to shock every once in a while by going a little over the top. But, you end up being just slightly amused rather than awed with those gimmicks. Even with these interesting deviations in terms of writing, the emotions never engage. It has to be as much due to how exposed we are to this theme as it is to the writing as it is to the performances. Over-written dialogue delivered by Sunny Deol in a manner that we are so used to over decades. For the rest you have Prakash Raj whose performance could've had an impact had it not been the, goodness knows how many, 15th time we've seen it.What I found absolutely ridiculous was the sudden introduction of a communal tone. It comes out of the blue and way too late in the scheme of things. It thus ends up sounding like an afterthought. Not that way too much thought has been put in the plot, anyway.And yet, isn't this what we knew to expect? The Deols - they seem to have a world of their own. That world has either the three of them in lead roles, else in cameos with one of them as a lead. This world has an audience of its own that enjoys cars lifted and turned around single-handedly by the famous two-and-a-half-kilo hand. This world is impervious to the likes and dislikes of outsiders. I watch because, well I like giving every movie a chance. Or maybe masochism just comes easily to me. ]"
178,"[Books being converted to movies are always a risky thing to do. Not always does it work out. Even in the case of something as epic as 'The Godfather', there is a split on which is better - the book or the movie. I belong to the side that votes for the book. And in the case of 'Hello', I feel the makers should not have attempted to bring it to the big screen at all.It is not so much about the fact that the plot is wafer thin or that the makers have chosen to ignore basic characterization in favor of dramatization. In any case, the backdrop of a call centre is incidental to the story and how it unfolds. Therefore the focus on this aspect seems unnecessary. Since this was always an adaptation of the book, the filmmakers could well have rewritten the backdrop to make it more believable on screen.The story is a simple one of six call-centre employees working on the same shift and how their lives seem to be intertwined. And then there's the night when things go awry. The physical setting of the call center (from the outside) looks genuine enough, but inside, it looks nothing short of a resort. Having seen a few call centres, I find it hard to believe that there are only six people working in a 'bay' at a time when headquarters (i.e. the US) is looking to cut costs. The very basic one would have expected from an IIM graduate writer when doing the screenplay is to pay more attention to such detail and make better use of the space. The story begins by appealing to the frontbenchers and Salman Khan doing an item number (rather tackily picturised with plastic water bottles, graphics that don't belong anywhere and a song that has no meaning). Hereafter he retires to the lounge of his helicopter charter service since he is stuck for over two hours on account of his chopper being repaired. And this is where Katrina Kaif finds him and the story begins.Shyam/Agent Sam (Sharman Joshi), Varun/Vroom (Sohail Khan), Radhika (Amrita Arora), Eesha (Eesha Koppikar), Priyanka (Gul Panag) and Military Uncle/VP Chauhan (Sharat Saxena) are colleagues and have been it would seem for almost four years. That none of them have a good enough accent when answering calls is a matter for their employer to worry about, not us! But this group is stuck at work on a stormy night when most systems are down and their lives are unraveling. Their evil (and conniving, yet stupid) boss Mr Bakshi (Dalip Tahil) is the common object of hate in the group.All the actors try their very best to look and be the part of call centre employees. One could argue that director Atul Agnihotri did not want to have a typical teenybopper look to the movie since they all do get identified as a bunch in the age-group of 20-25. Why I think Agnihotri didn't want to typecast is because none of them look like they fit this age group. Especially Gul Panag and Sohail Khan. As the night progresses, so does the childish nature of the entire narrative. While most of the sequences in the book itself were hard to digest, the movie makes it even worse. (There are typical references to gays and how Mr Bakshi is ok with it since this is an American company). Of the cast, Sharman Joshi shines through the cast as the confused team leader who has recently broken up with Priyanka. Eesha Koppikar hams her way through what could have been a better written role while Amrita Arora spends most of the time looking like a dolled up bahu dissatisfied with life. Sharat Saxena is honest to his role, but he doesn't have much to do and once again, the characterization leaves much to be desired. Gul Panag in her role as Priyanka is bound to catch everyone's eye. For she has spent a lot of time showing off her newfound cleavage. It is shocking to see how badly suited she is to the role. She tries to dress up like a 25-year-old, but just can't pull it off. In the bargain, all she manages is to look like a tramp (and she seriously needs help with make-up to align two mismatched eyebrows!).When the author of the book himself is doing the screenplay and dialogues, it is expected that he won't stray too far from the original work. Unfortunately, when the book itself has been written like a screenplay, it is tough to adapt it further to the big screen. One of the biggest negatives of the movie is the intentional name calling towards 'goras'. As a one-off, this could have fit into the movie. But repeated insistences like ""the mental ability of a 35-year-old American is as much as a 10-year-old Indian"" and ""Gore to fattu hote hai"" aren't exactly in the best taste. The entire movie is based on a 'call from God' that takes up about 5 minutes at best. Whatever they hear on the call is promptly put into action by the group with ridiculous ease. Nonetheless, the movie does have its moments when Sohail Khan and Sharman Joshi are on screen and but for their comic timing, the movie would have been nothing short of torturous. With them, it's up a notch at just unbearable!]"
179,"[James Wan's 2011 film Insidious had ended on a terrific note; a thrilling post-climactic twist that was worth almost as much as the entire film itself. The haunting woes of Josh Lambert and his family may not have been particularly scary, but it made for a taut little thriller that stayed with you. Now, two years later, and after getting that other excellent thrill-fest, The Conjuring, between himself and the first film, Wan is back with the sequel. Insidious Chapter 2 picks up almost immediately where the first film left off - the very next day, in fact. And this time, the film deals as much with Josh Lambert's past, as it does with his present and future...James Wan is slowly turning out to be a master of the horror-thriller genre. The instant difference that one can spot between Insidious and its sequel is Wan's maturity as a director. Of course, my personal pick out of his filmography still remains The Conjuring, but Insidious Chapter 2 is one of those rare sequels that effortlessly go notches above their predecessors, in virtually every department.What most films of this genre tend to mess up is the reason for the haunting. Clearly, Wan has figured out that the key to a successful supernatural story is the explanation behind the supernatural phenomena. Every film of his has the unmistakable aura of effort put in to crack a convincing backstory, and it shows in the manner in which he manages to always make you suspend your disbelief and get sucked in to the world of the paranormal.Also, while the first film introduced us to The Further - a dark, parallel realm that is inhabited by beings that yearn to be alive but aren't - the second film takes the concept of The Further, further. In doing so, Wan and co-writer Leigh Whannell also beautifully play with space and time - and this is precisely the best part of the film; what makes it a tremendous step up from Insidious. Needless to say, watching the sequel without watching the first film will be quite pointless. The cast of the first film - Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, Lin Shaye and Barbara Hershey amongst others - reprise their roles, and adequately lift their performances to go with the film. Patrick Wilson, in particular, really knocks it out of the park with his intensity and mystery that he infuses into the character of Josh Lambert. Also, young Ty Simpkins - who earlier taught Tony Stark a lesson or two in this year's summer blockbuster Iron Man 3 - returns as Josh's son Dalton, and it is refreshing to see a child in a horror film do something other than just be the manifestation or target of the haunting.What one misses in Insidious, as opposed to say Saw or The Conjuring, is a distinct sense of atmosphere that departs from a generic horror film feel. The Conjuring, in particular, scored so heavily, largely because of its grainy, period feel and the production design that complemented it so well. The Insidious films seem to rely more on conventional methods of scaring the audience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. A tighter, sharper, smarter thriller than the first film, Insidious Chapter 2 makes you glad that Wan decided to not just revisit the story, but to turn the page as well.]"
180,"[From love at first sight to till-death-do-us-part style, crazy love via the banter and misunderstandings that any relationship goes through - Ram-Leela has it all, in gorgeous frames, amongst lots of song and dance. That also makes it predictable, long and over-dramatized. For a better part of the first half Ram-Leela is completely engaging. The set-up is intriguing, the language brash and earthy, the characters draw interest and of course it is all very pretty. What also happens hand-in-hand though is that everything is a little overdone. For example, the songs are breathtakingly beautiful but go on for a  little too long; I actually laughed out loud at an innuendo and then it is stretched further to kill the joke; similarly the characters, at least the side characters, get a little too repetitive. The two central characters though keep you hooked - for the first hour. It is difficult to say whether that is because of the vivacious performances, or the strong-minded characters, or the chemistry between the lead pair or just that they look jaw-droppingly beautiful, or their colorful costumes or lack thereof. Or it could be just that you are soaking in the atmosphere. Or all of the above - you are hooked. Even so much so that you overlook the implausibility of it all.  You enter the fairytale, alright.The side characters too, hold their own both in terms of performances and the screen space they are given. Gulshan Devaiah and Richa Chadda have nicely layered characters - especially considering they are a part of a large canvas and there are many small characters to share the space with. Similarly, given how uni-dimensional Supriya Pathak's character is, she does a pretty decent job of instilling fear. Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone themselves are oozing oomph. At the same time, their presence is more than that. The pulsating sexual tension between them isn't a regular feature in Hindi films. Ranveer Singh is creating quite a space for himself as a romantic lead hero. Deepika Padukone too, not only looks prettier by the day but also engages as a performer. After that first hour though, because of the impact of how the film began, you wait for something more and better to happen. Unfortunately, the film pretty much takes the route you predicted at the end of this first hour. Other than the overall love angle, the story tries to touch upon a current social issue. But, it comes out of nowhere and doesn't get too much attention in the main scheme of things, later.  It thus, ends up looking like an afterthought. Sure, there are a few twists that you sit up to, but the impact fizzles out, because again it is either long-drawn or melo-dramatized by slow motion. These things only slow down the proceedings towards a climax that you know all about. There's loads of  violence too and some of it gory. While it does become all about one shooting the other shooting the one, there were a couple of chase sequences that I really liked - despite the slow-motion. The sound design and choreography is slick. In fact, each frame is picture perfect, the lighting in each frame looks divine. But, that is the very least you expect from a Sanjay Leela Bhansali film, right? And I can watch almost any film of his for just that atmosphere.  Even though, he goes all masala on you this time, barely clad men, women with backless blouses in a conservative set-up, item number and all! If you can too, you just might not mind Ram-Leela. Once, any way. ]"
181,"[There is something very fascinating about a short film. Within a few minutes, usually about one-fourth the length of a feature film, it is made to create a world, develop characters, present and resolve a conflict and see through the beginning, middle and end. Each of the five films that makes Shorts, is unique in the way it goes about its business. However, there are things that you might not understand and make you feel that you needed more time with the film. There are other times when the abstract treatment could get annoying. In either case, it is still an effort that definitely needs encouragement.There are a few things that are absolutely great across the board. Performances are just outstanding in each of the films. Even if its tempting to name a few of the known faces, It would be unfair to just point those out as great acts. They are very rooted and set in real life, except for maybe the second film, The Epilogue which needs histrionics because of the abstract treatment it carries.Similarly each of the films also creates a universe best fitted for its concept/theme. The ambiance is pitch perfect and most interestingly, even though each one is different from the other, it is easy enough to move from one to the other without feeling uprooted from the previous one. Dialogue is, in general, sparse, except for Audacity which needs the chaos that it generates. I think that is the beauty of dialogue writing, you need to know when not to have characters speak. It gives so much more room for the rest of the crew from the director and actors to the camera and music departments. Most enticing of them all are the concepts picked by each writer/director and the combination that makes for the feature length film. Let's take a brief look at each one. For a detailed look, you have watch the film, of course.Sujata by Shlok SharmaA girl is abused by her cousin from her childhood till present time where she's a grown woman. Sujata does get you rooting for its protagonist even though you barely know her. Unfortunately, that also becomes its handicap. To continue feeling her angst and being with her through her struggle, you are not offered much of a backstory. How justified is her anger towards the cousin? Do you endorse all her actions? While I am all for unanswered questions in films, this one made me uncomfortable. The Epilogue by Siddharth GuptFear. How do you deal with it? Maybe, the only way to face fear, is to ignore it. After all, it is like an beautiful woman who throws tantrum to get your attention. And  maybe there is only one way to deal with her. Or maybe it is just a claustrophobic relationship story that needs to get its closure.  That is the beauty of The Epilogue, it is open to interpretation.Audacity by Anirban RoyThe mind of a teenager. An already confused one. And then it has to face the perplexing and thus, frustrating double standards of parents. These standards or lack thereof do not allow the adults to take responsibility of their contribution to their child's misbehaviour. This child then decides to teach them a lesson. Is the child right in behaving so? Are the parents doing the right thing? This Bengali (with English subtitles) short, Audacity doesn't take sides and tells us that just maybe everyone is responsible in the said situation and you would only go around in circles if you played the blame game.Mehfuz by Rohit PandeyMehfuz is more to me about the mood it creates with its camera work and sound design than about what it is trying to say. With such films, you do not go about looking for meaning or deeper meaning. Its morbid and looks at morbidity in the eye. It goes on to confirm, even a cold graveyard worker cannot really get used to death.Shor by Neeraj GhaywanNothing like the sounds of Mumbai to make a movie called Shor. That it also points at the internal chaos each one of us faces, is of course, of larger significance. Most of our struggle is a lot about the one major relationship in our life and how dissatisfactory it is. It has never stopped amazing me that, the most important relationship of our life is the one we mistreat the most. And yet, life offers us a chance once in a while to set things right. Shor too creates just the right tone for what it has to say.~ ~ ~Each of the films has something going for it and takes a very serious look at one aspect of life or the other. Which brings me to the one question I've had about short films in general. Why do they have to be so serious? Does comedy need a bigger canvas? Even so, you cannot deny that this ""different"" experience is a welcome change. In the last 5-7 years, only every second or third year, have we had one feature length film which is only a collection of short films. It is really heartening to see two such films this year. I imagine a time, hopefully not to far away, when not only such films will be the norm, but also when a feature film will be preceded or followed by a short film which will be worth coming early or waiting for. More power to the brave souls who  have taken the first step towards making this happen.]"
182,"[Yet another common man is wronged by the system and he takes to ""fixing"" it. Ram Gopal Verma sees a solution in anarchy, but hasn't figured it out completely. So, he leaves us some bread crumbs to Satya 3. That, in all, is the purpose of Satya 2. Yet, it could have worked, had the execution not been so drab. This is despite the background score trying its best to keep you awake. Fortunately though, Satya 2 doesn't suffer too much from the typical camera gimmickry we have come to associate with a Ram Gopal Verma product. But, these are only small mercies. The performances are painfully dull. Punit Singh Ratn takes these abrupt pauses between two phrases, that it feels like the film's run-time would have been cut short by a good 5-7 minutes if he delivered the lines the way a normal human would talk. The rest of the cast doesn't have too much room or character depth to make an impression. Another 8-10 minutes would have been rescued if the slo-mo scenes were not at double the normal slo-mo pace. Many scenes in the second half come across as forcefully trying to make an impact, and they do pretty much the opposite - annoy, that is. Equally annoying are the songs that are not only randomly placed, but also exasperating to listen to and watch.Even so, the basic premise of the film is built up such that, just out of curiosity, you want to know how it is all going to end. THAT - how it all ends - is the biggest downer of them all. Till the climax, you are still hoping to figure how the protagonist has ""fixed"" the situation, despite all his inconsistencies and flawed logic. Alas, a voice-over wraps it up as clinically as it started the film and droned intermittently. It is indeed frustrating when you begin to appreciate how the sub-plots are shown in detail, and you are left hanging in the end. The climax reminded me of a Marathi essay I wrote in school, ""The autobiography of a soldier"" Mine was a prisoner of war who went through eight pages of trials and travails. In the end, he is let go, because he doesn't give in to the torture and the enemy gets bored. Yep, the enemy is bored of torturing my soldier. My teacher remarked, ""Well-written, but did the enemy get bored, or you?""]"
183,"[For a film of the scale and setting of Thor: The Dark World, what really makes or breaks it is how much you're invested, not in the hero, but in the villain of the enterprise, and what grandiose plans he has to unleash his evil on the world. Among the many factors that make the sequel to Thor a bit of a drag, the one at the forefront is the fact that the grand calamity that threatens to befall the universe is such a convoluted mess that you don't really care whether it happens or not.Like Iron Man 3, this film too picks up from where last year's The Avengers ended. Thor and Loki are back on their home planet Asgard, under the reign of their father Odin. Loki, of course, is thrown into prison for his mischief of the previous films. Meanwhile, in another corner of the universe, evil is brewing in the form of Malekith, leader of a race known as the Dark Elves.While Thor: The Dark World falls right into the series of standalone films of the characters from The Avengers in terms of sheer magnitude, the film suffers because it just doesn't interest you enough. Sure, it has the set pieces, the visual quality and a couple of characters - Thor and Loki, namely - who manage to keep you interested when they're around. But in terms of plot, The Dark World can only be described as underwhelming and ineffective. What's surprising is that unlike the Iron Man and Captain America films, which at the very least seem to be getting bigger and better with each subsequent release, Thor: The Dark World isn't even nearly as much plain old fun like 2011's Thor was. Sure, the VFX looks grander and the overall dimensions of the film are aimed at making your jaw drop; but it rarely succeeds in doing so, because the narrative of the film is yawn-inducing at best.Also, director Alan Taylor, who was roped in for the sequel doesn't quite seem to have a hold on his characters and the story the way Kenneth Branagh, who directed the first installment, did. In fact, one sorely misses some of the elegant close-ups of the previous film, which spoke so much in the most minimalist manner. Expectedly, Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as Thor and Loki respectively, are the only real saving graces of the film. Hiddleston, in particular, has such a magnetic screen presence and gets the best lines - and the most interesting character graph - in the film. While Natalie Portman as Thor's lady love Jane Foster looks gorgeous, she is saddled with a role not nearly worthy of her. Also, when filmmakers will stop giving us dumb-blonde-meets-physics-genius type female characters is anybody's guess. As for Anthony Hopkins as Odin, the less said the better. Obviously, then, the most important part that this new Thor film plays is keeping us occupied while we wait, first, for next year's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and then 2015's big one - The Avengers: Age of Ultron. Thor: The Dark World has a tiny cameo by another Avenger and an interesting-enough mid-credits tidbit in the end to make fanboys and fangirls salivate at the prospect of Joss Whedon's next Avengers extravaganza. Until then, there's only so much that this film can do.]"
184,"[The best thing about a science fiction/fantasy film is not in its ability to make us imagine. It's the ability that a film has to represent what we consider ""human"" or ""normal"" in a deliriously make-believe manner. The Hunger Games stumps you with its basic idea, but once you move beyond its premise, it manages to captivate you with the manner in which the message is told. For its ability to push you to fantasize beyond your regular boundaries of imagination, The Hunger Games is two and a half hours of intellectually-fuelled fantasy that you deserve. The Hunger Games has an extremely disturbing premise. Set in the futuristic city of Panem in America, based on the sci-fi novel of the same name written by Suzanne Collins, the movie revolves around the Annual Hunger Games. The Capitol city conducts The Hunger Games every year, to remind the 12 districts constituting Panem, of their authority and power.  24 teenagers or ""tributes"" as they are called are pitted against each other in the jungles in a survival-of-the-fittest type reality show, and only one emerges winner. As they battle it out, blood-wars and deceptions included, the people of the Capitol city celebrate it as a sporting event. The point is well made in your head by then, as an audience. You are indirectly told that a harsh remark is being made at the idea of urbanization. By the time the 24 teens enter the jungles you are well acquainted with the bizarre practices of the Capitol city. The film up till this point holds your attention, allows you to enter a world that is magnificently mocking and makes you sit-up and draw comparisons between Capitol City and planet Earth. But the moment the 24 kids enter the jungles, each adventure then becomes a tad bit predictable. A predictability that works but because it has such a meticulously-stimulating first half, it's almost as if you're transported into a different film. The two lead ""tributes"" Katniss Evergreen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are shown to be in love, because the Capitol authorities believe the audiences want something to hope for - they soon have a romance angle that is staged for the purpose of entertainment. It makes you want to feel ashamed of being a part of a generation that celebrates facades, and staged realities. The action in the jungle sequence has a few endearing moments too. - with relationships brewing between participants, in a situation of absolute rivalry. Oscar-nomited Jennifer Lawrence (As Katniss) brings the desired poker-faced burdened performance to her character - you immediately empathize with her, and hence agree with every move she makes during the games. In that sense, it's important that the film's protagonist makes that connection with its audience, which Lawrence manages well. As a film set in a post-apocalyptic future, The Hunger Games makes for a visual delight. With gritty, high intensity shots of the jungles that serve as a stark opposite to the urban ""jungle"" of the Capitol, the picture leaves you spell-bound. The Hunger Games is captivating in that it allows us to place a mirror at our own ""evolved"" practices. The representation of the people of the Capitol is remarkably innovative and even though a little loud you don't question the colored mustaches, the golden eye make-up - as they all serve as facades that we, as urban, bureaucratic puppets, often wear. The Hunger Games then is a well-thought, ingenious film with a promise of a sequel that I am waiting for with bated breath. ]"
185,"[Superhero vs. End-of-the-worlder - there are only so many ways this theme can go. Krrish 3 goes exactly that way - predictable down to the last scene and detail. Even so, well-written superhero films have something about the hero's dilemma or the situations he has to go through, to keep you interested. Krrish 3 shows potential with such situations a couple of times, but then they fizzle away. Krrish 3 just fizzles away.Actually, the film is somewhat of a surprise from what you expect. I didn't expect there to be much of a story - expectations set by Krrish. But, even though they aren't remotely logical, a few things that are cute. Just that the thought was put into it when it wasn't expected - reaches out to you. For example, the manner in which our end-of-the-worlder, Kaal (Viveik Oberoi) gets his army together. Also, as laughable as Rohit's (Hrithik Roshan) pet project is, the concept itself is used adorably. On the other hand, I expected the VFX to keep me glued but they turn out to be shoddy for way too many parts. The special effects in the first 20 minutes or so shocked me. The inside of an aircraft's cockpit reminded me of how drives in a car were shot in the 50s! When Krrish (Hrithik Roshan) flies, it's just that the fastening cord that holds Hrithik Roshan has been edited out, else you can pretty much tell it's there. However, there are a few special effects that work too. Despite a thousand and one inspirations Krrish 3's VFX are rather disappointing. There is only so much you can blame on the low budget. At the very least, they shouldn't have attempted the effects and action sequences that they couldn't do well. Mediocrity in this area from an action film of this stature is not acceptable.One of the other main things any action film relies on heavily is dialogue. And Krrish 3 has absolutely nothing going for itself in this department. ""Fusion is the Future,"" really? It's almost as if it were written for reviewers to fill a paragraph with. Then, you have Krrish sending across public service announcements and blatantly advertising way too many brands. Neither of them - be it noble or money-minded - have a place in a film. They instantly, bring you back to the real world, which is very jerky considering the fantasy world Krrish lives in. For a few minutes, I was impressed, even if with a fair share of amusement, with the Krishna vs. Kaal metaphor going on in the film. And then of course, they had to spoon-feed it and make you wonder if the villain was named Kaal just so that, a supposedly cool line could be said by Kaal. Oh well.That besides a child gets an absolutely unacceptable line. Interestingly enough, I didn't mind the performances at all. It could have to do with my mental preparation for an onslaught of hamming. But the 2.5 hours passed by with very few cringes, at least owing to the acting. Hrithik Roshan's transition from Rohit (dad) to Krishna (son) to Krrish (superhero) makes you admire him. It must not be easy to modulate your voice and keep it consistent the way he does for Rohit. Now, if only he didn't flare his nostrils as a sign of anger and/or disappointment and/or fear. Priyanka Chopra has very little to do, but there is this one glimpse and it stays for half a fraction of a second, which makes you wish she had been given more to do in that zone. Viveik Oberoi does do a decent job of instilling fear as the mean villain - for about two minutes. After that you just lament for what the character could have been. I guess you cannot fault the actor for that. But that gives him precious little to do. Kangna Ranaut's character, Kaaya too suffers from the same shortcoming in the writing department. Else, she could've been a really interesting character and Kangna was doing a fair job with it too.But then, if the makers had spent more time on the characters, they wouldn't have had the time to find abrupt places for songs to be inserted now, would they? That besides, the music, lyrics and worst of all the choreography (except for a few steps by Hrithik Roshan) take you straight back to the 90s. Now, where is the need for that?So, given what I liked in the film, would I watch it again? Not a chance! Do I regret watching it once? I don't regret watching any film once (well, almost - exceptions here and here).  Would I mind it if my kids watched it? Not really, only once, though. If you are a Hrithik Roshan fan - Happy Diwali! For the rest of us, don't watch it and have a Happy Diwali any way! :D]"
186,"[When I first watched the trailer of Ender's Game, it exhausted me even though it was only a couple of minutes long. The space-sci-fi setting - so overdone in recent times - seemed cumbersome; the VFX looked all-too-familiar; Harrison Ford, a long-time favourite of mine, seemed jaded; and, quite simply, the plot of the film just didn't seem inspiring. Obviously, then, expectations from the film were close to nil. I'd like to believe, though, that it wasn't just rock-bottom expectations that led me to be fairly intrigued by the film when I finally watched it.Set 50 years after our planet was invaded by and subsequently reclaimed from an alien species known as the Formics, we learn that the powers-that-be have zeroed in on a very peculiar manner of countering any further attacks - training Earth's brightest adolescent minds in tactical military strategy.It isn't completely the fault of this particular film, that it has arrived towards the fag end of the same year that saw films like Oblivion, Gravity, Elysium, After Earth, Pacific Rim, Star Trek Into Darkness and so many more. Despite being based on a book of the same name written all the way back in 1985, Ender's Game seems to have so many elements - big and small - similar to these films that it does seem a lot like deja vu; not to mention how it often reminds you of more seminal sci-fi flicks like The Matrix and Star Wars. Still, the film manages to hold its own by the time you reach the end of it, for more reasons than one.Despite its futuristic setting, the problems that young Ender faces hit home. He's a curious, brilliant child, but a bit of a misfit; he doesn't do so well under authority, quite prone to bursts of rebellion. Apart from being the usual save-the-world effort, the film, then, is also the coming-of-age story of young Ender. Far more interestingly, the film also very clearly raises questions about the art of war itself. Does war have any place for morality? If you are in a war, then is winning the sole objective of the war? What about the way you win it? Does history remember the victor or does it remember the side that fought with their morals intact?Even with these rather pertinent questions that the film raises, it does so within the periphery of Ender's story; thus coming across as fairly lightweight and breezy. Not that the pace of the film is brisk, but it keeps you on your toes guessing, while throwing in a twist or two, once in a while; right until the big climactic twist, which pushes the film up a few notches.Asa Butterfield, last seen as the blue-eyed, angelic titular boy in Martin Scorsese's Hugo, once again plays the titular character in Ender's Game. His eyes remain piercingly blue, but the difference is that the innocence of childhood has now been replaced by teenage angst and moral dilemma. Unusually lean and scrawny for the lead character in a film of this scale, it is this unassuming physicality which truly makes him stand out as a character. Besides, the boy has an intensity about him that one rarely sees in actors today, and that helps the film tremendously.Harrison Ford as Colonel Graff appears as worn out and jaded through the film as he seemed in the trailer. Also - though this could be just me - every time the film was in the midst of a space battle simulation scene with Ford sitting at a console trying to train the young cadets to fight, I couldn't help wishing for him to just whizz away on the Millennium Falcon and show them how it's done. Viola Davis and Sir Ben Kingsley, both in roles that didn't particularly need actors of their caliber, do well enough anyway.Director Gavin Hood, also credited as screenplay writer, doesn't ever let proceedings get too heavy or tedious. The plot twists are fun and keep you hooked for the large part. And though the VFX aren't particularly outstanding, they're largely unobtrusive, letting the story talk for itself. This helps the film as well. With a runtime of under two hours, then, Ender's Game is a surprisingly watchable film, and sets itself up nicely as a franchise for the future. ]"
187,"[A host of good-for-nothings trying to make quick money to pay off the yelling landlady breathing down their necks. Heard that one before? They strike the brilliant idea of objectifying the fairer sex and start with turning into peeping Toms. But, just any woman won't do. Not only does this particular lady have to have the perfect vital statistics, but she should also be a rich heir. Please note, there is no possibility of her being rich on her own merit. Mind you, though one woman will do for all of them put together. And of course the exaggeration plays equally on the male stereotype too. Poor things are shown to be even more insensitive than the average man, imagine that! Oh never mind, let's move on before I get all feminist on you.Oh come on, you cannot be blaming me for giving the story away; you have seen this bit before - many times. And anyway, giving credit where it is due, there is a little more to the movie than just the foursome wooing this lady. So what, if that little more might as well have made a different movie altogether. Now, why does the name Priyadarshan come to mind?Also creditworthy is how some of the funny dialogues are slickly put in between regular lines. So, only the very attentive will get the jokes. But that's about where the smartness ends. It pretty much doesn't matter which character says those lines because the characters don't have any individualistic characteristics. And it pretty much doesn't matter where in the story those dialogues are scripted, because they could equally randomly be interspersed anywhere in the rest of the story (ies).I think it is time I stop complaining about how wasted Om Puri, Sherman Joshi, and Rajpal Yadav in their loud characters or how wooden Kunal Khemu, Tusshar Kapoor, and Tanushree Dutta are in their loud characters or how loud Asrani and Tiku Talsania are in their loud characters. In future I will try and point out things about these actors only if they are any different.Music? Lyrics? Don't remember any of it. So, let's just say they were very forgettable.So, except for the few funny lines and the teeny-weeny bit of curiosity aroused by the second story, there isn't much going for this movie. But, then again, we weren't expecting anything different from this crew, were we?]"
188,"[The first thing that strikes you about Mickey Virus is the overt use of what is supposedly ""cool"" language. From facebook and twitter to use of words like backspace and escape in regular dialogue, Mickey Virus goes overboard just to make an impact, to squeeze a laugh out of you. Unfortunately, it is also the big picture that you walk out of the theater with. It is a shame then that Mickey Virus has enough material in its cute, albeit illogical story to have made a good comic thriller.From the slogan t-shirt to the one-liners, the film seems like its writing department's only aim was to impress with its wit in every single line - at least in the first half. The adrenaline rush seems to settle down post-interval, which is when the relentless onslaught of absolutely ridiculous computer jargon begins. Wires, USB sticks, random computer screens take over with a vengeance.More unfortunately than fortunately, Mickey Virus does have a decent story hiding behind all this mumbo-jumbo. Our man, Mickey (Manish Paul), a rockstar, computer hacker is roped in by the police to solve a cyber crime. He gets himself into a very tight spot around interval. By then, you have warmed up to his personality and you really want him to come out unscathed and want to know how he does it too. Alas, the weave gets so messy that you lose interest. It almost feels like its written by a 16-year old who is trying his hand at a story for the first time. In that sense, the movie is a good first attempt. But ultimately, it is pretty juvenile. This is besides the mind-numbing number of loopholes in the details. Thankfully though, the lead performance is pretty mature. It does require talent to portray a believable, charming, good-for-nothing buffoon. This, Manish Paul manages pretty well. Soon enough, he has to go into a serious, scared mode which he makes you believe too. The rest of the cast ain't bad either. In comedies like these, I am just thankful they aren't too loud. That relative restraint itself is applaud-worthy. How I wish some of that restraint was shown in filling the film up with romantic numbers that do not belong. Well I know, that is always too much to ask for. Having had a decent broad story and a good lead actor on board, Mickey Virus ought to have dived a little deeper to make for a thriller we could laugh with. It's as if the makers were either too lazy or too scared to fill in the details with smart content.  They opt for stuff that is so out there that no one will take the film seriously. This too would've been fine, if it were done in moderation. Mickey Virus does come across as a film that the makers weren't entirely comfortable with. There are sparks that indicate they would've rather made it an all-out thriller. The comedy bits seem like an outer cover, an after thought, even. Yet, it is great to see a comic thriller being attempted. A brainless comedy with some direction is better than one that hams aimlessly, any day.]"
189,"[Is there anyone at all in the world who has dared to use the unparalleled power of the World Wide Web towards a more controversial and daring endeavour than WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange? A man who single-handedly shook up the diplomatic establishment with his avante-garde whistleblowers' website, even a cursory read on Assange will tell you that his life is a story worth knowing about.You'd think that it would be pretty hard to mess up a film on the life of a man like Assange; you'd have so much material to go by that you wouldn't need to put in any extra effort to dramatize goings-on, or attempt any technical gimmickry to make things appear interesting. Well, it turns out that the director of the last two Twilight films can, indeed, make such a mess.One of the key problems with Bill Condon's The Fifth Estate is its jarring visual treatment; the gritty, shaky camera and nervous, frequent-cutting were probably employed to keep the audience on the edge at all times, but it just doesn't work. This is the kind of film where you want the writing to do the talking, not the camera or technique. Alas, the narrative of the film is flat, because of a singularly uninspiring screenplay.The film merely documents some of the key leaks that took the world by storm, while intermittently pausing to show Assange as a well-intentioned but egotistical, stubborn maniac - a man who didn't want to relinquish control simply because he trusted no one. There isn't anything in the film that you don't know or couldn't guess. It is watchable, but rarely anything more.Of course, a large part of the blame lies on the source material of the film. Based on the book 'Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange and the World's Most Dangerous Website' by Assange's erstwhile associate Daniel Domscheit-Berg, the film rarely offers any insight into Assange, or rarely delves into any truly thrilling or spectacular secrets that would shock the world. Berg and Assange had a well-known falling out, and while the film doesn't particularly go out of its way to paint Assange in a negative light, it almost seems more like an attempt to exonerate Berg from any blame.All eyes were on Benedict Cumberbatch and his portrayal of the controversial figure. Well, Cumberbatch has clearly tried hard. The problem is that the effort shows. His mannerisms and diction seem effected, though one can't fault him for failing to convey the right emotion. Daniel Bruhl, last seen as Niki Lauda in Rush, is excellent as always. He plays the author of the book the film is based on. He at least manages to convince you of his side of the story clearly. Even though Assange's character comes across as merely a slightly unusual piece of cardboard. I doubt that The Fifth Estate will be the last film on the life and times of Julian Assange, because surely there's a whole lot more to the man than what has hitherto been whistled and blown about. While this film is ordinary at best, something far more interesting - in true Assange style - is the open letter that Assange wrote to Benedict Cumberbatch when the film was still in its early days. That letter, at the very least, has a shred of emotion in it. ]"
190,"[Why is it that we, supposedly the most intelligent species on the planet, fail to recognize and respect every beating heart of every single being that belongs to any one of the millions of living species that we share our world with? The perverseness of humankind, particularly with our blatant disregard for the natural world around us, is no secret. Every once in a while, though, this lack of understanding and respect for the diverse and intriguing flora and fauna of our world can lead to horrifying and gruesome consequences, especially when what lies behind this is pure financial greed - a fact that is gut-wrenchingly exemplified in Gabriela Cowperthwaite's documentary, Blackfish.The film narrates a series of stories surrounding a killer whale (also known as an Orca,) named Tilikum, which was responsible for the deaths of a number of experienced whale trainers. Continuously gripping, often shocking but mostly just intensely moving and horrifying - all at once, Blackfish shows you both sides of the relationship that a human and an animal can share - it can be both, fulfilling as well as grotesque. Tautly narrated, relying primarily on archival footage and interviews of former trainers at SeaWorld a (dolphin amusement park), where Tilikum still remains, the film wastes no time in grabbing you by the gut and holding on to it right until it ends. It takes you through a range of emotions - from pure joy when you see what seems to be unadulterated love between a human being and a killer whale, to deep, dark, larger questions about whether everything that we see and feel is just a mirage.Also, an animal lover will truly be fascinated by the tiny glimpse that the film gives you, into the fascinating species of dolphins that killer whales are. Undeniably gorgeous, they're also highly intelligent, evolved creatures that seem to be just as capable of feeling complex emotions as human beings. The film's grainy, low resolution images almost never distract you, because the stories that it narrates and the emotions of some of interviewees are so genuine, so real, that you get taken in by it all. When you walk away from Blackfish, then, you're left with mixed feelings. The film is terrific, yes, but it makes you wonder if human beings as a species are the worst things that could have happened to a world as unique as Earth. It is only the tears that you see - and perhaps feel somewhere deep within - that remind you that what always comes with being a human being, is hope.]"
191,"[The entire movie, frame-by-frame, has been done extremely tastefully, an exceptional treat for the eye. Of course, you have to ignore Shah Rukh Khan and the exhibition of the many faces he is capable of making, through all of this. Fortunately, there is enough to distract us on the tour. Name it - cinematography, art direction, locations, action, special effects - all visuals have been done very skillfully. Our brains though are taken for a roller-coaster ride by the storyteller. Yes, there are a few additional twists to the original plot. While some of them work and keep you interested, with others you are deprived of a satisfactory explanation. The direction is classy in most parts. A few scenes are superbly executed - the one where Don meets Kamini (Kareena Kapoor), the one in which she is found dead, the one in which Jasjit (Arjun Rampal) is asked to do some work for the goons. Then there are others that could have been done better - the one where Vijay escapes while they are being transferred from one jail to another, the one where Jasjit is taking his child away from the gangsters. Having expectations before seeing a movie can change the flavor of a movie, just like the food you eat changes the flavor of a wine. This movie would be much more enjoyable if you are not constantly comparing. But expectations are called for when you are paying a high profile tribute to a high profile movie. Comparisons with the 1978 Don are inevitable. We have some cool new dialogues which add spice to the movie. Some loopholes from the first movie are smoothened out and a little additional back story fills in the blanks appropriately. But new loopholes and blanks crop up with the new situations. Let's just say, the new story has its fair share of flaws too. I thought Chandra Barot's Don was long and it dragged in the end. I was happy when a lot of sub-plots from the original were cut down, but was saddened very soon, with the new sub-plots taking up too much screen time. This time too the pace slackens in the last hour. You can't have an action movie in this day and age slowing down in the end - that's just wrong. Granted, Shah Rukh has a lot to live up to, but all he needed to do was follow the master's steps! Was there any change at all in dialogue delivery, intonation, voice modulation between Don and Vijay? In the Sauna scene, you see the Amitabh-Don oozing with confidence - the Shah Rukh-Don is just sitting there. You see constant suspicion, and rightly so, on Amitabh's face in 'Ye mera dil...' - through the song Shah Rukh's eyes are full of lust like that of a schoolboy, and suddenly he smartens up. You know Amitabh is satisfied and happy when he meets the children at their hostel, Shah Rukh is just regurgitating the lines. You sense fear in Amitabh's body language when Zeenat Aman points a gun at him, not a muscle moves on Shah Rukh's face in the corresponding scene. Maybe some of this can be claimed to be intentional, but all of it? That's hard to digest. The other actors have done a great job. Boman Irani seems to fit into any role that he takes up. Arjun Rampal needs special mention, why don't we see more of him? The three ladies Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, Ishha Koppikar do their bit suitably. Though the songs are not the greatest when you are listening to them (again because you are constantly comparing) they have been picturised beautifully. The choreography is very good especially for 'Maurya'. Shah Rukh oozes with energy when he dances and he has done a pretty good job with the rap-like singing bit in 'Khaike paan banaraswaala' too. All-in-all, you have to bear in mind that when you go for a Mission Impossible or a Bond movie, you go more for the style and special effects than to see a good story or quality acting. Similarly, a trip to the cinema halls won't be wasted when you go for this one; you are guaranteed a stylish product.]"
192,"[What if Robin Hood's father didn't know him for the good things he did and judged him for looting others? Maybe it'd make an interesting story, if it dealt with just that. Unfortunately, Boss starts out with this simple what if and complicates things beyond comprehension. To make matters manifold worse, this Robin Hood, Satya (Akshay Kumar) spouts inane dialogue to look cool; laughs at his own poor jokes; literally sings his own praises (just in case you hadn't guessed from the his finger rings); and is generally way too full of himself. The only saving grace is that he doesn't have a lead lady as a show piece. I guess, we could take offense that the makers of the film didn't even bother to have a role for a lead lady at all. But then if it were going to be as skimpily written as it was for Ankita (Aditi Rao Hydari), I guess it worked out best that there isn't a lead lady. Especially, given that Sonakshi Sinha's cameo had more recall value than Aditi's entire role. And I wouldn't blame Aditi's performance for it. The writing department just doesn't care enough to be taken seriously. With the numerous complications added to fill in the story, the writing completely loses track from where it starts. For example, Satya and Shiv's maternal uncle (Johny Lever) suddenly behaves like a stranger in a scene in the second half of the film. With such glaring mistakes, attention to detail is just way too much to ask for.Only aim here seems to be to give Akshay Kumar screen time. Interestingly enough, Akshay Kumar shows on screen 30 minutes into the film. I wonder what the reasons might have been. But, once he comes, he does his typical hamming and stays.Till then and for little snippets after Shiv Pandit does try his best to make an impact. But, it is Ronit Roy who stays in memory. He does have the fierceness that a villain pitted against a boisterous Satya/Akshay Kumar needs. Yet, his role is too ill-defined and unidimensional for it to instill fear. Sure, there are a couple of scenes which make you laugh out loud - more because it is silly beyond words than because it is witty. Also, the first one or two action sequences for Ronit Roy are brash enough to make you notice. Otherwise though, there are out-of-place film references, worse placed songs and over-the-top dialogues in the name of entertainment. I really wonder how one doesn't get bored doing the same kinds of role one after the other. Maybe they are different roles but are just performed in the same old way. Or maybe the roles aren't defined enough to be different or similar. Goodness knows. ]"
193,"[If I had to pick one Hindi film this year that shows the largest heart, that truly symbolizes the victory of sheer passion towards cinema and storytelling, then it would have to be Hansal Mehta's comeback film after a hiatus, the touching and eye-opening Shahid. The film traces the real life story of criminal lawyer Shahid Azmi, who was murdered for his defense of a Muslim man accused of being an accomplice in 26/11. Shahid's story begins when, as a youth living in Govandi (an eastern suburb in Mumbai) and traumatized by the Bombay riots of 1993, he flees to a jihadi camp for 'training'. The conflict between his own interpretation of Islam and that of the 'trainers' at the camp forces him to come back to Bombay, albeit into the arms of the police. Then begins his journey on the path of justice, something that he believes in till the very end.Shahid Azmi's story was clearly bursting to be told; a man who decided to fight for those who couldn't fight for themselves; a man who paid the price of justice with his life. I'm glad that it was Hansal Mehta who was destined to bring his story back into public consciousness. After the interesting Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar and the truly underrated Chhal, a slew of highly forgettable films made a promising career head southwards. With Shahid, hopefully that career will head towards where it should.While the film's biggest strength undoubtedly is the story of the Shahid himself, what really makes the cinematic version of it memorable is the cast of the film. Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub as Shahid's older brother is excellent. He is the actor who played the role of Manu Sharma in the recent screen adaptation of Jessica Lal's story. Anyone who loathed him then (because he was so good in the negative role) is bound to have a change of heart after this film. Prabhleen Sandhu as Shahid's wife Mariam has a pleasing presence. Kay Kay Menon in a small, but significant cameo is an absolute delight to watch. One really misses this incredible actor. Tigmanshu Dhulia and Vipin Sharma in small roles are terrific, as are the rest of the supporting cast.But the film ultimately belongs to Raj Kumar Yadav, the man who plays the title role. He invests himself into the character with such aplomb that one can easily feel his helplessness, his confusion, his ambition, his purpose and the rough edges that the character has. With every single performance of his, Raj Kumar underlines the fact that he is one of the most talented and dynamic young actors India has today. Hopefully, filmmakers will be able to channel his talent and challenge him with even more complex roles.Strictly as a film, Shahid isn't without its flaws. With budget and financial viability being perhaps the foremost reasons, the film suffers from technical and production-related problems. Right from issues like DSLR footage not blending in with the rest of the film, production value not being up to the standard that a film like this should ideally have had, to the fact that even though the film tracks nearly two decades of Shahid's life, he doesn't visually age at all - these problems stick out like thorns in the intense experience that the film otherwise is. Also, the film could and should have been crisper. Often, a lot of time is spent highlighting Shahid's character traits, especially right at the start of the film and then later in the film. I'm not sure if this has some connection to the fact that the editor of the film, Apurva Asrani, is also one of the screenplay writers. Either way, shortening the film could possibly have strengthened its impact.Still, it isn't often that the conviction and passion of the director and his team shines through in a film that clearly faced a number of obstacles in its making. Just for that, Shahid is a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen.]"
194,"[No doubt, some of the action sequences and a few of the aerial shots can be enjoyed only on the big screen. But, barring these, there isn't anything spectacular about the execution. In fact, a good many departments are just about mediocre - acting, dialogues, set design. And I am not even talking about less superficial things like character and tension build-up. The screenplay for Race seems to be in a race with itself at, at least, a couple of levels. (Sorry, the use of ""race"" was just too irresistible!). At one level, we have one sub-plot waiting to chop into action as soon as the previous one is done. At another, each sequence is trying to outdo the other in terms of ""gotcha! You didn't see that coming now, did ya?"" The narrative was interesting till it maintained the scheme of letting the audience know a little more than the other characters in the movie. Later it becomes the regular ""Guess who's the bigger fool?"" for the audience too. And in a way, you can take a fair guess at what is coming. If it's not going to be the obvious, it's going to be the opposite of the obvious, so there you go.The good thing though is that the women too have an actual role in the scheming. Don't worry guys - its Bipasha, Katrina and Sameera - they won't let you down if you are here for the skin show. They are not great at emoting. Anyway the story is more about their devious minds and not their emotions. You don't really feel for any of the men either. They are all so engrossed in outsmarting the other that they forget to feel deceit or love. There is this one-off expression by Akshaye Khanna that makes you laugh - intentionally, intentionally, so it's alright. It was all too funny, to see the actors complementing each other's acting skills on screen. Just in case no one else did that?The Karamchand-Kitty gig mimicked by Anil Kapoor-Sameera Reddy is rather tedious and so is the monologue by Johnny Lever.The dialogues do sound very labored. A lot of labor seems to have gone into searching the internet for sms jokes. Then they are laboriously forced into the flow of the story. The one-liners range from adult, as in they are 18 years old, to sexual-innuendo adult.The action sequences weren't fresh either. The one introducing Saif Ali Khan, and the climax, are executed really well, but there's nothing unique or stunningly creative about them. I absolutely enjoyed some of the aerial shots. Especially, the winding roads (South Africa, supposedly) with the backdrop of the rugged terrain indeed make you feel like whizzing past them. And if it's a Ferrari, who's complaining?What seemed rather amateurish, especially considering it is a high budget movie, is the art design. Good thing a lot of it was outdoors. From the hospital in South Africa to the tacky signboards that said ""Department of Home Affairs"" or ""Stallion"". Even movies on a shoestring budget do better than that. Or this song ""Khwab dekhe jhootha mootha"" with its ugly pink stars in the background which reminded me of a shabby set in Marigold.""Pehli nazar"" always sounded good and, sans Atif Aslam in your face every 4th second, looks good too. The title song and ""zara zara"" are foot-tapping numbers. And they do have purpose, you see. They are strategically placed after a twist/turn/roll in the tale. So, the audience can ruminate over the recent events of the story. Another purpose that they dutifully serve, of course, is to promote the movie. And whoever chose the songs that would go into the promos did a great job. Because the songs that didn't make it are really awful - ""dekho nashe mein"" and ""Khwab dekhe jhootha mootha"". Having said all that, I must say there is something about the movie that made it work overall. I don't know exactly what. Because each department has some major flaw or the other. It just maybe that the departments synergized well enough to let it have a general ""one-time watch"" feel.Save for a couple of stunts and some of the many aerial shots Race doesn't really warrant a trip to the theaters. If the director duo, were woken up in the middle of the night and asked, ""Ultimately, who won the Race?"" They are going to be flummoxed. Or maybe not...they might just say, ""Dude, WE DID!!!"" Because, we, the audience love our cheap thrills and there hasn't been anything glossy around for quite some time. So we will be compelled to flock the box-office. Oh well, so be it.]"
195,"[Dylan Mohan Gray's Fire in the Blood is a documentary on a burning issue that perhaps none of us truly paid attention to. But when we first hear of it in the context of this film, it won't particularly surprise us too much either. I mean, we all know that multi-billion corporations will do what it takes to multiply those billions. Yet, as we watch the film gradually unfold, we realize the sheer magnitude of the problem, and it is shocking. We've all been exposed to the blood-curdling visuals and statistics of how diseases like AIDS have ravaged so much of Africa and the rest of the developing world. The film talks about how large pharmaceutical companies in the West work solely driven by their bottom line; how providing low cost drugs to those who are in dire need isn't a concern for them at all.What becomes both the weakness as well as the strength of Fire in the Blood is the fact that there is almost no technical or creative accomplishment in the film. The visuals are plain, the narrative is driven by interviews, and the music score is bland at best. Instinctively, you'd think that an issue like this, had it been backed by haunting imagery and an interesting narrative style, would have truly been memorable. Still, complete credit to Gray for not going down that route, and choosing to stick to his bare minimum narrative that focuses on the issue alone, and nothing else. It also tells us just how impactful the issue really is. It doesn't need any further embellishment to create an impact. It also really makes us question where humanity is headed; why and on what grounds do we value one life more than the other, and what will it take for the corporate machinery to realize that some things are more important than profit. For its complete honesty and adherence to only the issue that it chooses to talk about and nothing else, Fire in the Blood is a film as well as a movement that must be supported. Only when the entire world begins to ask tough questions of those who deserve it, will wheels of change begin to churn.]"
196,"[War films - whether they are between countries or gangs - invariably end up touching on the futility of war.  War - Chhod Na Yaar wears it as a badge of honor. Even though, the route is different because they use satire and comedy, the theme is rubbed in way too hard. True, the solution to something like the India-Pakistan war can be as simple as 'stop fighting'. If only, it were that simple though, right? Given that War Chhod Na Yaar is satire and doesn't claim to take anything seriously, it might be a tad unfair to hold its simple solutions against it. Even so, the film misses basic coherence.Behind its satirical coat, War Chhod Na Yaar can get away with the implausibility of the plot. But then, the characters, situations, and dialogue were supposed to make you laugh or at least smirk, right? For example, the initial setup of an imminent war at the border, where our protagonists are stationed, doesn't move beyond until the film is well into the second half. To keep the situations comic you have typical potshots at Pakistanis. I would like to think that even for those who find it funny, the jokes would get old within five minutes of the film. Other than that there is toilet humor and other inane one-liners. And generic references to facebook and chat do not a cool movie make. Maybe, there is an odd line here or there that could make you laugh; other than that you are just waiting for something to happen. Sharman Joshi, Javed Jaffrey, and Sanjai Mishra do bring some energy to the film. However again, their characters get repetitive and thus predictable pretty soon. Soha Ali Khan is required to feel shy, flirt with her eyes and look determined every once in a while. She does that all right. Then you have your regular dose of songs that have no business being in the film. I guess we should just be thankful that there aren't any choreographed and/or item numbers. I am all for films that speak about the power of the common man. But, War Chhodo Na Yaar is more dissuading than empowering. It is highly unlikely that the makers didn't want to inspire the audience and make them feel like they can play a role. In that case, you can only think of it as an attempt that failed. Not to mention that an entire section of the population has been totally ignored. The section that does believe that the war should be fought. Maybe, that would be another film. Hopefully not. ]"
197,"[In Gravity, Mexican maestro Alfonso Cuaron has made black look more gorgeous than it has ever seemed on the big screen.While there is no judging someone who doesn't like Gravity (indeed, there's no judging anyone at all for having their own personal opinion on any work of art) the thing is that, more than any other recent film, if you love this film, then you absolutely want everyone else to love it too. You want to share with them the truly immersive experience that Cuaron, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and the entire visual effects and production team behind Gravity have created for all of us.So, as you settle in to your seats, and you read the opening text and get on with the film itself, I dare you to not blink until the first cut in the film. You won't be able to do this of course, because the first shot of the film lasts long. Really long. But then, that's trademark Cuaron. Fact is that the best, most terrific aspects of Gravity are virtually invisible. They're what are behind the seemingly simple task of making a largely two-character film with almost minimal visible production design. Gravity is path-breaking without appearing to be. It is the kind of epic that doesn't quite claim to be one; it just is. If Y Tu Mama Tambien was audacious and Children of Men was visionary, (and if you thought The Prisoner of Azkaban was the best-directed Harry Potter film,) then Gravity is downright epochal in writing, execution and performance.At a crisp 90 minutes, Gravity is at once a taut sci-fi thriller as well as a gripping human drama. ""Two astronauts get stranded in space after a freak accident,"" may sound like it has nothing to it. But, as you experience a suitably charming performance by George Clooney and an absolutely marvellous turn by Sandra Bullock, you realize that at the heart of the ground-breaking technique - that has helped Gravity become not just one of the best space-based films ever, but also arguably the best use of 3D in cinema, period - lies the most primal human instinct of attempting to survive against all odds.Yet, it isn't just one aspect of Gravity that makes it the cinematic experience that it is. There's the sound design - space has no medium and hence sound can't travel in space - combined with the terse, visceral background score. Then there are some gorgeous frames that have been lit unlike anything you've seen before. There's the most realistic zero-gravity effect you've ever seen characters in. Then, there's also that brief moment early on that makes you smile; when a secondary character begins to sing a classic Hindi song.Gravity is the kind of film that you must watch once, then - irrespective of whether you loved it or you didn't see the big deal in it - go devour every online resource about the making of the film, and then go back and watch again. That's when you'll truly appreciate the unassuming spectacle that it truly is.If you're a fan of cinema, then watch Gravity right from the first frame till the last frame of the closing credits. If you're a fan of Hindi film music, then don't shy away from smiling wide when you see the names of Shailendra and Shankar-Jaikishen in the end credits. With Gravity, you have to let yourself be sucked into a world you could scarcely have imagined. Even though the tagline of the film is, 'Don't let go,' do yourself a favour and do let go when you watch it; because, somewhere, even Sir Isaac Newton surely has. ]"
198,"[Haven't you, at least once in your life, wished that you could travel back in time to undo something that you'd done, or to do something differently? And what if you suddenly had that power? How much of your life would you change, and how much of that power would you use to chart the course of your future? Either way, even with this power, would one still really have any control over destiny?Any time travel film makes you ponder over these questions, but Richard Curtis's About Time is actually built around them. 21-year-old Tim discovers that he has the ability travel through time. Once Tim figures out how it works, he goes about trying to ensure that life for him pans out just the way he wants it.Curtis, quite the master of mush, creates a warm little world for gawky Tim; a world that makes you smile more than once, because of some adorable characters and some genuinely witty moments involving Tim and the people in his life; his father (an adequately charming Bill Nighy); Mary, the woman he loves (a slightly miscast but still lovable Rachel McAdams); his sister Kit Kat; and some more. Tim - played with the perfect mix of earnest awkwardness and charm by Domhnall Gleeson - is also often faced with situations that don't necessarily involve him directly, but which make him want to use his power nonetheless.Despite the unfair advantage that Tim has in his life, you're almost always rooting for him. You can almost tell when and why he'll use his power, and how it will go. What makes you want his life to turn out just the way he wants it to is the fact that you can see that Tim is fundamentally a good guy. He wouldn't use his power to harm anyone, and the manner in which his character is written and acted convinces you of that almost instantly. The film's weakest aspect is the time travel itself. Even though it is used with the intent of conveying a certain message each time and is to be taken at face value, the fact remains that it takes too many logical liberties far too often. So, instead of focusing on the 'where', 'why' and 'when' of it - which is what the film is actually supposed to be about - you're left wondering about the 'how' - how did that happen, exactly, when it was clearly against the 'rules'?Simply put, you're left thinking about the logical inconsistencies when instead you should be buying in to the film's core message. Also, the film really slows down towards the end, when the message has been adequately hammered on your head a few times, and it still waits to spell the whole thing out for you.Despite the voluminous plot holes, the film's warm, self-deprecating, quite British humour, the performances, and the honest message that the film tries to convey makes About Time a film that is never offensive and invariably happy. People in a certain frame of mind often look for a particular kind of film to catch on DVD or TV to elevate their mood. About Time is precisely that kind of film. Either directly or indirectly, it will make you see that there's no greater waste of time than a bad mood.]"
199,"[I won't ever forget how the 11-year-old me reacted to the news of Lady Diana's death. My first, instant reaction - which I said out aloud - was, ""Good riddance."" My rather insensitive reaction to that quite tragic piece of news was because - and I remember this clear as daylight - I thought that for someone whose only claim to fame was that she married the Prince of Wales, she seemed to be present for one photo op too many. And this was in the days when we didn't even have access to the kind of 24 x 7 news channels like we do today.It took me a few more years to realize that this was hardly her fault; because sometimes fame chases even those who don't want it. I must confess that I have been intrigued by her charismatic personality and her extraordinarily eventful life ever since. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel's film on Princess Diana covers the last two years of her life, when she fell in the kind of love that isn't meant to be, up until the day of her tragic death in Paris, which sent waves of shock all around the world. Hirschbiegel's terrific 2004 film Downfall was similarly based on the last days of the life of a highly controversial public figure. The maturity, however, with which he treated that film seemed to be lacking in Diana.When you're making a film on the life of a personality like Princess Diana, you're always walking a thin line. Everyone has shades of grey, but with celebrity status, those shades assume mammoth proportions, and you never quite know where you're headed while recounting their life. Perhaps the intent of the makers of Diana was to capture the various shades of the enigma that was she, but unfortunately, what comes across is a far too sanitized version of the last years of her life.The problem with the film, really, lies in the fact that you can never tell where her tale is being told from. Is it from the vantage point of an objective third person? Is it from the perspective of the Lady herself? Or is it from the point of view of someone in the middle - someone who knew her well enough to know certain intimate parts of her life, and yet not too close enough for her to completely trust?As you struggle trying to figure this out, you're left with images and scenes of an idealistic woman who saw everything in black or white. She was either the victim or the savior, never just a person. The Diana of the film often comes across as an idealistic little girl trapped in a shell of fame; a shell that she'd have loved to break away from.  Whether she actually was that, one can never know, but surely painting her world in broad strokes does little justice to the life she lived, and the travails she doubtlessly endured.If Diana still is a film that can be watched at least once, it is because of Naomi Watts. Now Watts looks nothing like Diana as far as facial features are concerned. However, ever so often, when, in the film, her face is in a slight silhouette, or it passes by the camera in a flash, or even when it is gently out of focus, I couldn't help but see Diana in her. Combine that with a regal gait, and Watts convinces you that she certainly wasn't miscast. The slightly-out-of-shape Naveen Andrews was a brave choice for the character of Dr. Hasnat Khan. The fact that it isn't a ruggedly masculine, chiseled man playing the character lends an air of authenticity.Still, for various reasons, Diana is far too shallow a film to truly go down as a memorable look at Lady Diana's life. The good news, however, is that it still leaves the window open for someone else to attempt another cinematic crack at the fascinating life of one of the most enduring women ever.]"
200,"[I guess every star worth his salt should have a typical potboiler to his name - one which makes no sense plot-wise, but insists on claiming that it has one; one which likes to believe that it entertains with toilet and sex humor; one which has a lame song every 15-20 minutes. Besharam is that film for Ranbir Kapoor.The worst bit is that it doesn't do this typical stuff with conviction. Everything from the villain's tyranny to the hero's unabashed personality via the lead lady's pretentiousness seems very well calculated and squeezed in to fit a formula.What's more, this must be first of Ranbir Kapoor's films where you just cannot forget that it is him on screen. It doesn't help that his parents feature in the film as a couple; even though the three of them together Ranbir Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh do their best to infuse energy into a spark-less script. It is their comic timing that brings the few laughs that the dialogue allow. That besides, they have pretty much made fools of themselves in a couple of scenes. Pallavi Sharda's presence doesn't bring in any sparkle either. Javed Jaffrey only adds his well-known poor puns. Then again, maybe the blame should be reserved for the writing department. I sat there feeling pretty much insulted that the makers thought this would go down as story/characters/dialogue for us, as an audience. It's not only the predictability of how the different worlds of Mr. Besharam's personality come together or the lack of a peak point. It is as much the feeling that minimum effort was put into thinking about these attributes. Even the action sequences and songs are rather generic.Sure, there is an attempt at being fresh by including bold and crass dialogue. You also have your typical film references strewn across - from Sholay to DDLJ to of course, Dabangg. But, can these lines work when the overall plot is as run-down as it was a couple of decades ago? A soft-cornered Robin Hood-like  hero; a woman who so easily falls for the guy after putting up oh-so-much resistance; a comic relief track. In fact, the mix is worsened by an uninterested villain. Maybe people who can watch Ranbir Kapoor do anything will have a good laugh with him in this one. But, are a star's fans doing justice to his talent by liking films that they wouldn't want the star associated with, in general?]"
201,"[Everyone in Gyan Correa's The Good Road is lost. But spend a second introspecting about your own life and you might just ask yourself, ""Do even I really know where I am?"" The harsh highway in Gujarat, then, that forms the setting for the stories in The Good Road is quite likely a metaphor for life itself. And, as a character quite rightly says in the film, there are so many highways in India - so many lives and so many stories just waiting to be told.David, Kiran and their 7-year-old son Aditya are a young family from Mumbai on a vacation to Gujarat. A twist of circumstance leads Aditya to be separated from his parents, and he ends up traveling with Pappu and Shaukat - a pair of truckers who are on a bit of a mission of their own, so to speak. Then there's Poonam, a little girl on her way to meet her grandmother in Athangasa, who unfortunately ends up exactly where a little 11-year-old girl by herself must not go.The three stories wind around each other to form the film's narrative - simple, sparse tales that, bit by bit, reveal a little about the characters as they voice their thoughts and apprehensions. Pappu, Shaukat and Aditya, for instance, develop a strange relationship as they spend time with each other. Aditya, in particular, makes you see that divisions and a sense of 'us and them' is something that you truly develop only as you grow older. The innocence of a child is always a great leveler - it almost never distinguishes between two people based on exterior factors that us adults are most likely to spot.There is no attempt at a graph, no attempt at infusing any drama into the film. Quite like life itself, the film just trudges along based on what a particular characters believes or wants to do at a particular moment. This approach lends a mature tone to The Good Road, though I can completely imagine people finding the narrative too slow for its own good. We in India aren't too used to films that don't attempt to create a graph, which don't try to creep up on the audience with a twist or two, and just go where the characters take them. In that sense, The Good Road is a good example of storytelling for the sake of the story, and not for the sake of the audience. That being said, one can't but help feel that if you are relying so heavily on characters and their relationships to drive a story, it becomes absolutely imperative for every character to actually stay in character and behave in character. Many a time there are instances where you notice the characters avoid the most obvious logical steps to take in a situation, instead they do something completely counter-intuitive. The screenplay of the film, then, ends up striking too many false notes - strange, considering that it was developed at one of Film Bazaar Screenwriters' Lab of 2008.The film also suffers from some unimpressive key performances. Ajay Gehi has always been a bit too overenthusiastic in front of the camera. Here, as David, he does pretty much the same thing. Sonali Kulkarni, who always manages to convey just the right amount of emotion, does well, despite her small role. Little Keval Katrodia as Aditya charms you with his naivety. The real letdown is Shamji Dhana Kesaria as Pappu. The relationship Pappu develops with Aditya is heartwarming, but doesn't quite have the intended effect because Kesaria is plain expressionless. Priyank Upadhyay, who plays his sidekick Shaukat, is an absolute natural, though. Some of the other minor characters who appear through the film are supposedly locals who were made to act, and the rawness shows often.The film, however, benefits immensely from the sun-bathed landscape of Gujarat, which lends itself to many a poignant frame in the film. In fact, the stark, bare-minimum movement of the camera works really well for the tone of the film, Rather than impressing you outright with gorgeous cinematography, the film lets the composition of frames and the subjects do the talking. A special mention must also be made of the sound design. The film actually relies a lot on the sounds to create a sense of place and time, often even more than the visuals.There aren't many who pause to think about this, but a film is almost always only as good as what each member of the audience takes with them before experiencing the film. If you don't usually watch a film for the second time within a few days of your first viewing, then try it once. I can guarantee that the same film will look different based on your state of mind. Keeping this in mind, it becomes extremely difficult to view The Good Road with an objective mindset, considering the furore over its selection as India's official entry for the Academy Awards' best Foreign Language Film category after the widespread support, even internationally, for The Lunchbox. Still, I'd urge you to keep all of it out of your mind before catching The Good Road on DVD. While the DVD itself holds nothing more than the film, if you love cinema and like giving different kinds of cinema a shot, then try this one too. Is the film better than The Lunchbox? Debatable, because such questions don't have a yes-no answer. Is the film good enough to represent India internationally? Probably not. Will it make it to the final Academy Awards shortlist? Almost certainly not. But is the film worth a watch for some gorgeous visuals and sounds, and a rare maturity in its storytelling that rises above the issues in its writing? The honest answer is, ""Yes"". ]"
202,"[A theme that involves a bunch of people stuck in a tight life or death situation can invoke only so much thrill. Especially, if you are exposed to thrillers.  You know some will die, some will make it. You know bad things will happen and either the characters will find a way out or not. The mystery of whether or not happens by itself isn't intriguing enough. Then what is it that hooks the audience in, if at all? Characters? Atmosphere? You need that extra spark to keep you with the film, which unfortunately is wanting in Warning. What Warning has though is an urge to do something that has rarely, if ever, been tried in Hindi films - use vast expanses of water to create a chilling atmosphere. It succeeds at times, and not so much at others but the effort to do something new is not lost on the audience. A large part of what didn't work can be attributed to the loss of brightness due to 3D. I won't say the 3D was bad, because it does shake you up a bit when a shark comes your way, if only the water was bluer maybe the film wouldn't come across as dull.True, once the situation sets in, there is hardly any up or down in the arc of the story. You have your regular drill of the blame-game, self-blame, introspection people bonding and/or fighting and so on.  There are huge group dynamics that can be explored in situations like this. But, neither the thrill element nor the human angle is touched upon more than superficially. It helps then that the actors do a decent job put together. Except for the French speaking woman who looks out-of-place, maybe intentionally, the rest of the cast goes about alternating between supportive, scared, strong, sad and so on pretty well. Another thing that worked well was the claustrophobia created by the open space that the ocean is. By the end of the film, you could feel your skin shrivel as if you were in the water for those over 1.5 hours. I don't know if I should happy then that an attempt was made or be unhappy that it wasn't taken a level deeper to engage and/or explore. ]"
203,"[The illusion called reality. You walk into the mind of another person and you are bound to feel disoriented. And if the mind of that person is under illusions, your can only imagine the chaos you find yourself in. This is the world Prague takes you to - the world of a young man, Chandan where he has lost capacity to tell between reality and illusion, how do you expect to get it?If only, Prague sensitizes you to the constantly shaken up feeling of a person suffering from schizophrenia. If you find it uncomfortable to watch, imagine what that person's life must be like. It is a mercy then that you know the trigger behind Chandan's hallucinations. Else, the only way to explain the workings of these illusions is chemical imbalance.Prague then is an intense, trippy snippet of Chandan's life. Played out beautifully by Chandan Roy Sanyal and his hallucinations - guilt-tripper Arfi Lamba, lover Elena Kazan and alter-ego friend Mayank Kumar. Or maybe they are real people and not his hallucinations.This constant doubt makes the film predictable in that you doubt everything you are watching and wonder if you'll ever know what the reality is. Yet, the edgy, non-linear treatment keeps you hooked. Interestingly, the non-linearity is what brings a weird sense of flow to the events. You might never find out the chronological order of events, and yet it might make sense to you because it doesn't really matter. I am instantly attracted to things that I don't understand completely. The intrigue in itself is enticing. This is where Prague scores. ]"
204,"[Parental pressure, business-politics-underworld nexus, child sex abuse and of course, love and revenge are the many themes John Day wants to talk about. It turns out that none of them is expressed with any conviction. Not that I am asking for long lectures or powerful drama, just an engaging tale would do. John Day, like the trailers promise, starts off with very fine suspense. Three-four threads run parallel and keep you guessing. The connection is elusive, yet not so out of reach that you lose interest. It all blends in together well too. But, along the way, the various themes John Day tries to reach out to become one too many for its own good.Also, it takes itself way too seriously. Sure, any humor would feel completely out-of-place, the grim texture of the film makes it out to be much more important than it really is. The story doesn't really warrant a film over two hours. Not like it's a surprise, it is Naseeruddin Shah's performance that keeps the audience going. Yet, with a character that has barely any shades there is only so much he can do. Fortunately, he does get able support from Randeep Hooda who broods all too well. The downer, of course, is we've seen Naseeruddin Shah do so much better and Randeep Hooda do the nasty bit already. I actually liked Vipin sharma's performance too. Elena Kazan though stuck out like a sore thumb.In fact, the entire romantic track between her character and Randeep's lengthened the film way more than their chemistry warranted. On the other hand, the give and take between Naseeruddin Shah and Randeep Hooda too is hazy. The dots don't connect. If you are interested enough to, that is.There are a few pretty gory scenes which seem like they are exist more to shock than to add inherent value. Similarly, the themes of child sex abuse and parental pressure seem to be forced in rather than blending in. It is a boon then, that there are no song and dance routines added to the mix. But, the background score did seem a little confused between horror and thriller. Besides the decent performances the cinematography and a few cynically witty lines are your meager takeaways from John Day.The need to be thrilled shall have to wait for the next one that claims to be a thriller. ]"
205,"[A man is found stealing a mango.Situation 1: He's chased and beaten to pulp and thrown into jail. Situation 2: The chasers realize that he's not eaten anything in 5 days and that's why he's stealing. You beat him on the way to jail. Situation 3: The chasers realize that he was stealing it for his children and wife. They haven't eaten in 5 days. You give him a warning and let him go. Situation 4: The chasers realize that he is stealing for his family because he has been duped by a loan-shark. You might actually go with him to beat up the loanshark. Suppose the mango was not stolen. But it was a couple of buildings in downtown Manhattan that he conspired to blow up and did so successfully. Not pardonable, right? Even if it is similar to situation 4. But, of course.Suppose he was not he, he was you? Now, what do you do? This is the debate New York struggles with. It doesn't offer solutions or show one right path - that is the script's beauty. For, there ain't a straightforward answer to this dilemma. Yeah, there's loads of stereotyping - whites are painted the darkest hue of black. What if the whites were not the whites, they were you? After all the insanity and inhumanity of racial profiling is prevalent just about everywhere. That's exactly what the security guards at every building gate are doing. That's exactly what the barricades in the middle of city roads are for.All good, message nice. Arguments on both sides convincing thus engaging. But, and here's the biggest BUT of all...why over-dramatize it? It's Aditya Chopra, so we know there's going to be drama. The 'over' is overtly annoying and doesn't provide much relief until the interval. It actually reminded of the days of VCRs when my mom would forward through half a Hindi film. The background music is too on-the-ear except for a place or two where it's really well done. The close-ups are beautiful but at places which need ruggedness not beauty. The slo-mo's are arrrrrgggh!...yep...frustratingly irritating. Disturbing the flow, distracting from the plot and all that jazz! And this happens all the time, not just at key plot points. The one much talked about intense scene is completely spoilt by the camera gimmickry. Whatever catches the director's or producer's fancy, found place in the film, thus making it a much longer film than necessary. It didn't look like a Kabir Khan film at all. Did the producer do as much directing as producing? Thankfully the producer, who's also the writer, also did a fair job of writing the overall plot. And this in comparison to reasonably well-received films like Black Friday and Fanaa, both of which had similar elements. And both of which I didn't really like. The point is the struggle and the frustration of the people who are discriminated against. And that is made well enough for us to be curious about what's up next, despite the gaps. What scheme? What plan? Why is such a small gang under FBI's radar? The writer couldn't be bothered with those details. And when some of the more minute details are given you wish they weren't because you could've predicted them 30 seconds ago. There surely must be other ways to create suspense than to give it extra brooding time and kill it. Same goes for the (lack of) punch in the one-liners. But most of this is restricted to the first half. The second half becomes heavy and gripping. Inspite of the glaring NO-NOs, there's quite a bit to cherish. The performances were brilliant. Now who would've thought this space would have said that about Katrina Kaif and John Abraham? Okay it's only relative, they are brilliant compared to their earlier non-performances. Katrina Kaif, as expected from an Aditya Chopra story, has a strong role in support. She not only looks her usual pretty self, but this time around, she makes you feel for her and her accent doesn't bother as much. John Abraham can actually convey his character's emotions if he's shown how and New York shows how. It's unfair that not much can be said about actors like Irrfan Khan other than ""his usual best"". The penalty one has to pay for being talented. Neil Nitin Mukesh is good but looks like he's capable of much more, just needs to find more variety.So, what is it that can't keep the bling out of a YR film? When will the constant, visible struggle between supposed ""mass pleasing"" and need and mood of the story get over? They are edging to make films that make a difference. They have made some moves in this film that won't be very popular. Then why not go the whole 9 yards? Or are they taking one baby step at a time...pushing the envelope? I hope so.]"
206,"[UpdateIt's always nice to have DVD features that provide you with an insight into what it really took to make the film. Luckily, the DVD of Elysium at least does some justice on that front. The DVD has two decent featurettes related to the film. The first one, titled 'Collaboration: Crafting the Performances in Elysium', has the director, Neill Blomkamp, as well as some others, talk about the primary cast of the film - Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley. Roughly 13 minutes long, it talks about how they were chosen, what went into their characters and performances. The second, about 12 minutes long, is called 'Engineering Utopia: Creating a Society in the Sky'. It talks about how Elysium, the utopian world located off Earth in the film, was conceptualized and designed. It reminds you of just how tough filmmaking is, particularly when crafting something as visually spectacular as Elysium. Most importantly, both features give us a peek into the mind of Neill Blomkamp. His penchant for talking about current world issues while using a dystopian future as a setting is exciting enough; the fact is that he is an indie filmmaker at heart, and one with a very strong voice at that. The thought he put into the cast and into the design of his film highlights this really well.The DVD has no Indian language options unfortunately, which would have been an added bonus. The film itself makes for a fair home video watch, and is actually the kind of film that seems better on the second watch - a sign that the film truly has layers. * No matter how far into the future or how far back in the past a film is set, the core values that drive characters and their motivations remain quite the same. Greed, ambition, delusions of self-importance, love and sacrifice; cinematic portayals of these will always evoke an emotional response. That's what lies at the heart of Neill Blomkamp's latest film, Elysium.Set in the year 2154, the film - like so many others in the recent past - shows a dystopian Earth in shambles because of disease and poverty. The rich, of course, have a solution to this - a plush, artificial satellite world named Elysium; a world that has its own governance and system of control over the less fortunate. Max is one of the lowly citizens of Earth, one who has always dreamed of living on Elysium instead.In terms of look and production, Elysium is a clear notch above Blomkamp's highly acclaimed and quite terrific film District 9 - which was also set in a dystopian future. Also, quite like how District 9 spoke about a serious issue plaguing humanity - social segregation - and the potential threat that increasing dependence on private funding can pose, Elysium too looks at very real problems facing humankind today - class divides and the power that a select few have by virtue of their financial superiority.Seen through the prism of a time that seems so distant to us, the depiction of the disparity and contrast between the haves and the haves-not might seem a little extreme in the film, if you don't pause to look at how it is actually a very serious reflection of society as it stands today. Isn't Antilla, for example, a current day version of Elysium? The question, ""How rich is too rich,"" just has no answer today. In Blomkamp's futuristic, ultra-beautiful, lens-flared universe this question is underlined further. The poor obviously want more, but the rich want even more. Money, power, control; those who have even some of it want all of it.Then again, Elysium also has within it the message that there is still hope; and cinema itself has in it the power to effortlessly instill that hope in us.  There is the ability to love, to feel, and to give anything up for the sake of a loved one. Despite the predictable turns that the film takes, it largely works because of the incredible detailing in Blomkamp's vision of the future, some electric hand combat fight scenes, and because of the key actors in Elysium.There are very few actors like Jodie Foster. She can radiate a warm, feminine presence with as much ease as she can seem cold, cunning, calculative and cruel. In Elysium, she falls into the latter category, and though the character itself is one she can easily sleepwalk through, that doesn't make it any less effective. Matt Damon, who plays Max, once again assumes a physical personality to go with his character, and he is good as always. He has to virtually carry the film on his shoulders, and he pulls it off convincingly. The remainder of the cast, however, is seldom anything more than functional.Elysium, quite like its namesake haven for the rich in the film, is by no means perfect. Despite its breakneck pace, it seems far longer than its runtime of 111 minutes. Its rather linear graph serves its purpose, but doesn't grab you and hook you the way you would have liked, considering the sheer scale of the visuals. Also - and this is a problem that most futuristic sci-fi films face - the depiction and usage of some of the technology strikes more than a few false notes. Even if you account for the liberty that a sci-fi film is invariably allowed to take, there are still logical loopholes in some of the tech, apart from the many times you wonder that if they could manage technology as complex as that, then why couldn't they manage something as simple as this.Despite the niggles, Elysium makes for a fun big screen watch. You might as well watch it today, because you never quite know what tomorrow has in store.]"
207,"[Anybody can write a story. But translating the written word into cinema takes a whole lot more; no, not the money or the resources that a film invariably requires, but the craft to create a sense of atmosphere; the ability to evoke an emotional reaction; the sheer fortitude to go the whole hog and stick to the characters and their journey that, until then, existed only on paper. For this and so much more, director Denis Villeneuve deserves more than a pat on his back.An innocuous-enough Thanksgiving dinner between two families turns into a nightmare as the younger child of each family, both girls, go missing. The nightmare becomes more horrifying with each passing minute, as the sequence of unfolding events stems from the past and has repercussions on the future...Prisoners, which quite easily counts as one of my favourite films of the year so far, begins with a gently uttered prayer. Then, as this stark, measured, bone-chilling thriller begins to unfold, a careful cinema-watcher may notice how Christian iconography subtly but repeatedly appears through the initial half of the film, until it suddenly stops. Consequently, one can't help but wonder if this has any significance in the alarming larger scheme of things. That is, of course, only until the writer and director choose to clear the fog and let you release that heartbeat you'd been holding up for so long. You'll probably then forget all about the symbolism and foreshadowing, and that is where Villeneuve truly, genuinely, comes up trumps with Prisoners.His narration is extremely understated, as subtle as it can be. He lays out almost all his cards on the table earlier than most directors would have had the guts to. The trick, though, lies in achieving the balance between revealing your cards, while inviting, in fact challenging, even the most attentive of viewers to keep pace with him. Unlike a lot of thrillers where you're always either a step ahead of the director or many steps behind, in Prisoners, you're almost always walking alongside him. How much you enjoy the film depends on what he's showing you, and where you're looking.Then, of course, there is the moral ambiguity that the writer and director toy with. There's the father of one of the missing girls, there's the cop investigating the case, and there is the world that is affected by a terrifying ordeal. You always know how you want the film to end, but the moral questions the film poses in its journey to the end is what really holds the film together. Prisoners is embellished by at least two standout performances. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, father of one of the missing girls. In a span of under two years, Jackman has played such widely different characters in Real Steel, Les Miserables, The Wolverine and now Prisoners, that one can't help but be wowed by him each time he appears on screen. His desperation, his conviction and his frustration all seem so real, you can't help but feel for him. The revelation, though is Jake Gyllenhaal as the interestingly named Loki, the obsessive detective chasing the case. Gyllenhaal played a very similar character in David Fincher's Zodiac, but his performance in Prisoners shows just how much he has grown as an actor. The soul of the film, however, is Roger Deakins' cinematography. Be it the dark, torch-lit or headlight-lit frames or the sleet-obscured shots, the film's continuous sense of murky foreboding must almost wholly be credited to Mr. Deakins. Every time I watch a film shot by him, I can't help but feel that he is truly one of the greatest cinematographers ever. Prisoners also has a sparse background score that enhances the mood the film creates. As the characters in the film question and act on their own motivations, you question your own moral compass as well. Prisoners isn't quite a film for everyone, and this isn't just because of the bloodshed or the horrifying aspects of the story. The fact is that if you let yourself get sucked into the world that the film creates, you will ask questions of yourself as well. And those, usually, are the toughest ones to answer.]"
208,"[I'm not one to subscribe to gender stereotypes of any kind, but there just is something about men and fast machines that draw them to each other. The sound of a high horsepower engine revving, the sight of metal beautifully moulded to aerodynamic perfection, the idea of touching a land-speed of 300 km per hour, the sheer romance of living life on the edge - I don't know about the rest, but I do know why I enjoy cruising at speeds in excess of what one might consider safe, and I do know why I've been a Formula 1 fan for the better part of my life now.If you're a Formula 1 buff, particularly of F1 history, then you already know who Niki Lauda and James Hunt are, and you probably know about the 1976 F1 Championship in their context. If you don't know who they are, then, well, you'll still probably enjoy Ron Howard's Rush. For the uninitiated, Lauda and Hunt are and were former F1 World Champions, who had a thrilling on-track rivalry for most of their racing careers, right from when they competed in 'lowly' F3 together, all the way up to the pinnacle of motorsport - Formula 1. The peak of this great racing rivalry was the 1976 F1 Championship, which forms the core of Rush, which, apart from being something of a biopic, is also a thrilling ode to not just the second most watched sport in the world, but to the spirit of sport itself.Lauda and Hunt were starkly opposite in personality, something that really fuelled their rivalry. Hunt was charismatic, blonde, oozing masculine charm and had a colourful professional as well as personal life. Lauda, on the other hand, was precise, meticulous and dour, and he spoke only when necessary and exactly as much as necessary. Their racing styles reflected their personalities, but both of them were undeniably terrific racing drivers. Quite simply, their rivalry was always a film waiting to happen. And what a film it has made for. Dramatic and thrilling in equal measure, it is films like Rush that keep reminding us that truth will always be more fascinating than fiction. Rush makes you feel for the characters, it makes you want to sit in an F1 car yourself, and it makes you see what competitive sport at the highest level is all about. It is about talent and perseverance, about the will to win, and about the important role that destiny itself has in success at the zenith of your field. Ron Howard has always had a strong sense of embellishing drama, and he's in top form in Rush as well. The thing about great rivals in any field, be it fictitious or in real life, is that one is because of the other. Think Bernini and Borromini; think Batman and the Joker; think Lauda and Hunt; Howard and writer Peter Morgan capture this facet in a way that's obvious yet beautiful; in a manner that makes you want to pick a side, but also makes you wonder whose side you should be on.What also works really well for the film is the fact that Howard has handled the racing scenes with extreme dexterity as well. From gorgeous long shots of the track and cars to extreme close-ups of car parts mid-race, you feel the thrill and the adrenaline rush that can only honestly be bettered by actually being in an F1 car.I must confess that, on seeing the first promo of the film months ago, while I thought Daniel Bruhl was a fair choice for Lauda, I was a little skeptical about Chris Hemsworth playing James Hunt. I thought he would bring in too much of his own image into the character; I thought that James Hunt would turn out to be too 'Thor' for my liking. However, both Bruhl and Hemsworth have outdone themselves in Rush. Their personalities play off each other well, and they convince you of the respect as well as loathing the two characters have for each other.Hans Zimmer, for a change, has turned out fairly minimalist score for the film. The music kicks in when required, but it largely plays second fiddle to the characters and their conflict, which works well for the film. With so much going for it, the thing about Rush is, an F1 fan is almost guaranteed to like it, but I won't be surprised if the film makes a few converts as well. Head off to the theatres, then. Step on it.]"
209,"[After a certain stage in a relationship, most likely, there is comfort or stagnancy. In either case, you need an extra spark, something to look forward to. The apprehension; the spring in the step; the glint in the eye that a new relationship brings - that's what The Lunchbox is about. And more. Like any other relationship, Ila-Fernandes relationship is as much about the two individuals as it is about the relationship itself. Sure, the chemistry builds up beautifully, without one setting an eye on the other. But, their personal insecurities, frustrations is what makes The Lunchbox stand apart from most other films.Moreover, the whole package is breathtakingly simple. The one-line plot, the characters, the ambiance, the situations, the humor would make even the most city-bred in the audience believe that a middle-class world like this exists, as much as it ever did, even today. The one-liner ""what if"" - what if the well-known lunchbox system went wrong one day and put two lonely souls in touch with each other? How fascinating an idea! Of the thousands of possibilities, the one writer/director Ritesh Batra picks is as charmingly old-school as it gets. The characters he picks to put together are mere faces in the crowd of 20 million. Ordinary, uninteresting - most likely, you and me. The side characters, including the neighbor oldie (Bharti Achrekar) you don't see, are given quirks that are thoroughly enjoyable, even if not real. You don't root for any of the characters, you just play along and are willing to go wherever the story takes you. There is no arc. There is no significant peak in the story. The simple progress of conversations between Ila and Fernandez is enough to keep you going. Each one is special; just like each conversation of a budding relationship is dear. Yet, none of it, not a thing would've been acceptable if it weren't for Irrfan Khan and Nimrat Kaur. Let alone the slightest show of spark or disappointment in their eyes, the variation in the tone for their voice-overs is enough to inspire awe. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a charmer as always. The most obvious character in the film is one I am biased towards - Mumbai. Any film that reminds me of the sights, the smells, the energy of that city has won me over in the first scene. In complete contrast to this buzzing city is, ever so slow-paced, The Lunchbox. A beautiful contrast which could get to you if you are waiting for something to happen. So, depending on your make and what you seek in your films, the climax can be exhilarating or underwhelming. I was bang in between, even though I cannot see a more fitting end to the film. That's what will make or break the film for you. ]"
210,"[Films like Phata Poster Nikla Hero make me wonder about the larger purpose. What drove the makers to make this film? So, here we have the theme of a wannabe actor landing himself in situations which force him to become a real life hero. Squeezed in you have a mother's aspirations for her son. All of this is made out to be silly, just in case you take any of this seriously. But, then the laughs drain out because of repetitions and/or labored explanations. The story knows not where to stop and you are running around in circles much like the characters in supposedly comic climax fight sequence.Andaz Apna Apna had an elaborate and absolutely hilarious last fight sequence - purely because it was silly beyond comprehension. Phata Poster Nikla Hero seemed to be gearing up to something similar. Unfortunately, it wasn't even close. Also, the sensibilities have changed since the 90s too. Which pretty much can be said of all of Phata Poster Nikla Hero.From the texture of the film to characters like the righteous mother - the film has a very dated feel about it. As if the makers were relishing nostalgia, rather than make a fresh film. The only thing fresh about the film is Shahid Kapoor's performance. Yes, the role and the film's genre require him to be loud and so he is. Yet, there is a certain composure about his performance within the context of his character. He over-acts and yet there is some constraint to not get annoying. Ileana D'Cruz on the other hand irritates soon enough, especially at places where she is required to pause between words for effect. The timing is all wrong. Though its cute to see Padmini Kolhapure back, her performance is as theatrical as it ever was. Darshan Jariwala, Zakir Hussain, Sudhir Mishra all go about their dos like they would in any third film that they do. I must say though, there are times when you can't help but laugh at the silliness on screen. Much like Andaz Apna Apna - despite the annoying self-referencing jokes strewn across the film. But, of course, these times are few and far between. Less often than the completely out-of-context songs that are picturised in a completely different tone to make the misfit even worse.In general, I find silly comedy cumboresome. Even Andaz Apna Apna, arguably the silliest of them all took its time to grow on me. At least, it went all out there. Phata Poster Nikla Hero seems like the writers lost steam within 30 minutes of run-time. How are we supposed to hold up for another two hours?]"
211,"[For a person who has no affinity to the horror genre, Horror Story reaffirms the subconscious conclusion - they have run out of ideas. Be it a haunted house, hotel, hospital or graveyard - there is a discontent soul, usually woman who generally doesn't like people and invariably likes terrifying them. You my add hundreds of screeching musical instruments and minutes after minutes of prolonged pauses to supposedly build the suspense. And boo! Gotchya!How many times of the same thing can you take in one film without losing patience, though? That too without any connection with any of the characters whatsoever. Your only involvement with them seems to be out of humanity. No one should have to spend a night fearing for their life. The actors do a decent job, but there is barely any distinguishing characteristic, except that initially a few of them are more afraid than others. So, there is hardly any scope to deviate from a scared expression - across actors. That the ghost's motivations are practically non-existent, could've been used so much more terrifyingly, but here the way it is played out completely kills it. The only thing going for Horror Story is then that despite all things mind-numbingly lame about the film, it does manage to create a decent atmosphere of claustrophobia through the film. That triggers a shiver a couple of times. Unfortunately, that's about it. 90 minutes of being locked in a theater to watch 7 people locked in a haunted hotel. I know, I have the liberty of walking out of the theater. But, some of us just cannot walk out on a movie. That's our make. And we have to bear the burden of our personalities.]"
212,"[Not too often is women's sexuality or rather her openness about her sexuality explored in Hindi films. For that, BA Pass can be appreciated. But other than that, it is a pretty hollow affair. There are lots of bold, sexual sequences which are dealt with pretty matter-of-factly. That could be a good thing, if that's what the scene aimed at conveying. There were tinges of pity and hatred you were supposed to feel, but you don't. The way Sarika's (Shilpa Shukla) character is built up, you'd have liked to hate her; similarly you'd have liked to feel bad for Mukesh (Shabad Kamal) but that feeling to is very superficial.Fortunately or unfortunately, this has nothing to do with the performances. The screenplay and/or direction are the culprit here. The film has a strong base of sexually explicit scenes, and it feels like the actors have put in an extra effort to feel comfortable in those sequences. Wherein lies the problem. The effort shows, instead of the chemistry reaching out to you. Which is still better than the awkward sex scenes that you see in Hindi films otherwise.Sure, here are a bunch of characters, that don't really feel anything for each other and so that distance is acceptable. But, that I connect with no one, either in a positive or negative way, keeps me from getting involved in the film as an experience. That besides, the story has a lot of meat in terms of a cheating wife who is in general a manipulative opportunist; a shy boy who is used; women who express their sexuality. But all these themes are explored rather half-heartedly, except for the sex angle, which gets plenty exposure. It's not like I'm asking for the other possibilities to get attention - like the dynamics of marital strain or sibling angle. You are shown tiny sparks but nothing on is dwelt on for too long. Just would have worked better if the themes they picked on were fleshed out better.Later, BA Pass becomes a hotch-potch of moments of despair. They too are forced, as if they had to do what they had to do because it was pre-decided that they are out to make a dark film. You then have a weird mix of stylized treatment which comes too late and is quite out of place. Halfway through the film, I wondered if my experience would've been any different had I seen the film with a serious film festival audience instead of being seated between an easily excitable bunch of boys. But, as the film progressed, I was relieved to feel assured that it wouldn't make much of a difference. As disconnected as it may sound, the film's title is what impressed me the most. Ironical to the root, BA Pass is a title that fits the film perfectly in more than one ways. Unfortunately, that's where the impact of the film stops - skin deep.]"
213,"[""Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" - Morpheus, The Matrix (1999)The story of how Pawan Kumar's second feature film was made has become a part of cinema lore. Failed attempts at finding a producer led to a scathing blog post from the director, which then led to him exploring crowd-funding. This culminated in the 50-lakh-odd film Lucia, shot on a Canon 5D - now the first crowd-funded Kannada film to find a theatrical release.People tend to judge an indie film differently from a 'normal' film, whatever that means. 'Indie' doesn't necessarily equate to 'made with heart, but of merely acceptable quality'. That's where, say, a Ship of Theseus - or now, a Lucia - comes along and teaches you to not look at an indie film through the lens of sympathy. No matter what the budget or the circumstances under which the film was made, if you expect someone to pay to watch your film, it better be damn good. After all, the story of your film's making doesn't appear in the subtitles to your film. The only story that matters is the story of the film itself; and that's where Lucia scores heavily.Nikhil, affectionately called Nikki, is a normal common man with a somewhat-normal affliction - insomnia. One of his nocturnal sojourns, however, leads him to something that starts giving him not just sleep, but sleep with dreams that he has always dreamt of seeing. Obviously, all good things come with a rider...Throughout time, dreams have always fascinated artists across media, because of just how they are always open to interpretation and how no one has still fully been able to understand dreams, despite the age of advancement we live in. Lucia takes of all of that mystery and fascination and fits it into a layered - yet largely lucid - tale of ambition, desire and destiny. Drawing slightly from the quote at the start of the review, while also tipping its hat to Christopher Nolan's Inception, Lucia is often twisted and smart, but that can often fool a part of the audience. What truly makes it worth your time is that it has a soul; an emotional story with characters that you get involved in and whose story you almost desperately want to see the resolution of. Nikki - both 'sides' of him - are characters that you instantly root for, because you see where he is coming from. The same goes for the love of his life Shwetha - a woman with real, practical dreams and aspirations, irrespective of which face of her character you consider. The film is also a pointed take on one of the fundamental truths of humankind - that the grass is always greener on the other side. One always covets what the other has, never once pausing to think about how unique and special what they already have is. Lucia spends its first hour setting up a mystery that you quickly feel like getting to the bottom of - that of Nikki's dreams. And it does so with zippy cuts and a fast-moving narrative that still never takes your attention off the story. In the second half - and this is where some are likely to have a problem with it - the film changes gears and focuses more on the characters. In fact, if you happen to unravel the mystery before it is meant to be unraveled, then you are also likely to feel a sense of been-there-seen-that. Despite this, the film largely holds up, because even if you see hints of where the story is heading, you are still curious about where the characters end up.It helps greatly that the story is backed by convincing lead performances. Sathish Neenasam, who plays Nikki, completely looks and behaves like how Nikki should, at every point in the story. The pretty Sruthi Hariharan as Shwetha is superb as well. Even when her character makes choices that you may disagree with, she still manages to convince you of where she's coming from. I don't have the faintest idea of whether the two of them are established names in Kannada cinema or not, but they are perfect for the characters they play in Lucia. Some of the supporting cast is shaky, but you look past them because the characters they play hold fort.On a personal note, the film is a nice little ode to cinema itself. Starting from the obvious nature of Nikki's character (and how I'm tempted to reveal a slight spoiler here, but I won't,) to the more subtle ways in which cinema seems to mirror real life and vice versa, Lucia can delight a true cinephile - one who sees cinema as beyond just love for and opinions about the films one sees.The true victory of Lucia is that it manages to make you gloss over its relatively technical limitations, not out of pity, but because you are so drawn into the story and the characters. It underlines the fact that at the end of the day, the script is king. The minutes (or, if you're lucky, hours) that you spend post the film wondering whether you're in a dream or not are an added bonus. ]"
214,"[Why are remakes made, again? I'd think it's because the makers felt there was some great value addition they thought they could make which the original badly needed. Other than the fact, of course, that they didn't have anything original to make. But, I refuse to believe that the makers of this remake of Zanjeer didn't know they were taking away from an already not-so-great film. Are they so smug to not realise that a two-expression Ram Charan taking the place of Amitabh Bachchan is many huge steps behind to start of with? Are they so blind to not see the disservice to films from the 70s by having a over-bearingly peppy, supposedly dumb Mala (Priyanka Chopra) replace a simple and sensitive Mala (Jaya Bachchan)? The original had this nice combination of angst and sensitivity between Vijay and Mala. It wasn't explored too well there too, but here it is completely ignored. This takes away a huge chunk of the meat that the plot had. I guess the only positive contribution by this Zanjeer is that the woman gets invited to the birthday party! You see, Mala was left out of Sher Khan's birthday party in 1973. Come 2013, she gets to look pretty in white and shake a leg too!Priyanka Chopra, like I mentioned earlier, plays a very perky Mala. We can't really fault her if the script used her like comic relief. That besides, Ram Charan tries too hard to look intense and Sanjay Dutt looks like he was forced to play Sher Khan. There is a slur in his movements in the fight scenes and in his speech when he speaks. A couple of other things make things even worse - the dialogue and the music. You don't know what is worse - the iconic original lines that are retained or the new lame lines. A few more moments of disbelief - how could they not know that 'jab tak baithne ki ijaazat...' by anyone but Amitabh Bachchan or 'Sher Khan beimaani ka kaam bhi...' by anyone but Pran is epic fail? The songs are more or less annoying. My take on item number is no secret. Not only are they aesthetically displeasing and condescending to me as an audience, but the manner in which they break the flow of the story is the most irritating bit of them all. Here you have two songs that can fit that bill. Zanjeer also has a ridiculous background score. At first when, 'raghupati raghav...' played during a fight sequence, I wondered if the projectionist goofed up and turned on Satyagraha's soundtrack. Unfortunately, not. And the background track repeated almost every time Vijay has a fight sequence. Oh well...I understand that even if you had nothing better to do, you'd be better off watching the Zanjeer from 1973, this one cannot be completely written off - maybe just because I have seen worse, and await much worse. ]"
215,"[Is marriage dying? No, not yours or a marriage around you. Marriage - as a concept, is it dying? That's the question Shudh Desi Romance is trying to get a hold of. You'd think it is as interesting as the trailers and songs of the film promised. Alas, that doesn't work out. 15-20 minutes into the film and you know the plot is falling flat. I've warmed up to the idea of confused / listless / loser lead characters since I started seeing poetry in their tragedy. So, I try to find that in Raghuram Sitaram (Sushant Singh Rajput). That made me want to love him. Also, Rajput plays the youngster with earnestness. His confusion though boyish, comes across as a very ""man""-like thing to do. Yes, yes, stereotyping and all. But, I can imagine many women going ""these men!"" if they look at him from the ""he can't express himself"" angle. He does have his charm, yet it is very difficult to see why these vibrant, confidently aggressive women - two not one - have fallen for him. What's that they say about love, again? Let's say blind, it is. So, two blind women and a loser. Even if I were told that before watching the film, so strong is my faith in Jaideep Sahni that I'd still look forward to it. And he doesn't disappoint - well, at least not in the dialogue. The lines are earthy, snappy, and delivered well. In fact, they are the only things that keep the film going. And Rishi Kapoor, of course - thank goodness for him! After all, there's only so much that can keep you interested if events get repetitive. And that is where I had a hard time accepting that it is Jaideep Sahni's work. True, there is a pattern to every person's behavior, especially when it comes to their love life. But, the repetition here isn't interesting enough to sail you through 2+ hours. It's almost as if the makers realised it was getting boring when they have the characters break the fourth wall to explain their motives to us. For one, their characters weren't that deeply sketched for us to have too many questions about their motivation. And then, there are some things that are better left unsaid. Also, with the realistic treatment that the film gets from its art director, it is a rude intrusion. Not that B-town neighbours accepting a young couple in a live-in relationship is very real. But, then that you accept as a realism that the makers wish for or even foresee. It helps that Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor make Gayatri and Tara seem very comfortable with who they are. Except when it comes to being intimate with the guy they are in love with. I must admit here, that the awkard first kiss is charming in its own way. But, it is difficult to believe that the couple who is so comfortable when they sing are so out of sorts when they aren't singing about their love life. After comments on varying topics from US' involvement in wars world-wide to safety of women in India, all it boils down to is the lyrics of one of the songs - 'chanchal mann, ati random...' (Flitting mind/heart, very random) - Shudh Desi Romance - with all its zeal to be pertinent, comes across as rather random. ]"
216,"[Director Marc Forster has steadily built up a solid little CV that has a number of watchable, if not really interesting, films. Though not quite in the league of some of his better work -Finding Neverland and Monster's Ball, for example - his latest film, the long-in-production zombie-actioner World War Z, surprisingly doesn't exactly do his filmography much harm either. World War Z is what you get when Steven Sodherberg's Contagion mates with Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, with an added dose of serious crack for good measure. An unknown, fast-acting pathogen that affects humans has spawned a deadly horde of zombies that is quickly turning entire cities into vast fields of the undead. Gerry Lane, a retired United Nations field investigator is reluctantly pulled out of a quiet retirement to identify the source of the virus.Despite the clear attempt to lend an air of credibilty to the zombie genre, which has thus far either been made strictly for fans of the genre or coupled with a comic element, World War Z can crumble under serious examination. It abandons coherence in space and time, takes umpteen liberties with its screenplay and has a singularly unmemorable cast, save for Brad Pitt, who himself looks a little haggard and battle-weary, and not strictly because he single-handedly takes on zombie armies either. Also, and there is no denying this, World War Z is the kind of predictable, done-to-death film that Hollywood is no stranger to.Still, if World War Z ends up being watchable enough, it is because of a few genuine thrills that the film manages to pack into its runtime, Ben Seresin's breakneck cinematography that manages to create a perceptible sense of atmosphere despite showing evident disdain towards lucidity in close-combat action scenes, and  some superbly-executed VFX. Also, even a tired-looking, underwhelming Brad Pitt has goods enough to pack a wallop with his effortless screen presence.Also, though this could possibly just be the softie in me, for the first time a zombie film had my heart reach out a little bit for the zombies themselves. In fact, considering how seriously the film takes itself, I personally felt it squandered an opportunity to show how zombie-like our own existences have become. After all, a purpose-less, materialistic life is hardly better than the un-life of a zombie; at least zombies have a purpose - infecting humans. Expectedly, the resolution of the film is as far-fetched as can be. And this is perhaps where Brad Pitt's persona helps the most; you need that kind of presence to overlook how truly incredulous the goings-on actually are. Apart from the last 20 minutes of the film, I really missed the kind of urgency he brought to his character in Babel or the sheer confident cockiness he displayed in Moneyball.The film is out in 2D as well as 3D, and again, the film would be far better experienced in 2D. The 3D darkens an already dark film, and doesn't really add much in terms of the 'third dimension' anyway. World War Z is really just a film for fans of rugged action and saving-the-world films, the kind of film that the audience should not take too seriously, even if the filmmakers themselves have done so.]"
217,"[With themes like bribery and corruption a film almost always has black and white characters. I doubt there is any other way to go about it. System - bad, common man - good. Politician - bad, idealist - good. In that sense, Satyagraha doesn't have any surprises at all. But, the unexpected comes in little packages every once in a while - in a one-off expression by Manoj Bajpayee or a slight deviation from what we have come to expect in such films from the characters. Not that it takes away too much from the predictability of the overall plot, even so. There's another thing about films that take a stand on a social issue that in the writer's zeal to make the point, characters take about turns in their character graphs for no compelling reason. Satyagraha keeps away from any such temptations. This keeps the battle between good and bad very interesting because you are always waiting for the other side's next move. Also, the focus on the issue starts in the first few minutes and stays on till the very end.Except of course, for a detour at Junction Romance. The one romantic sequence and the song that follows sticks out like a sore thumb, quite literally. The picturization of that song is so weird and out of the place for the film that you wonder if it was shot and squeezed into the film as an afterthought. Fortunately, all through the performances are ace rate. Undoubtedly, you forget he's Amitabh Bachchan and worry about Dwarka Anand's blood pressure at the beginning itself, when you see his blood boil and bitterness at the unfairness of the system. Ajay Devgn looks a tad old for the age he plays but nothing like watching a man shed tears on screen to appreciate his performance, needless to say he does well. No one brings out your spite towards a negative character like Manoj Bajpayee. Kareena Kapoor, Amrita Rao, and Arjun Rampal lay their bits as usual. Nothing that sticks out as very bad or good. Yet, Satyagraha stays interesting only because the issue is so close to home. Sure, you have seen it all - in films and in real life too. It manages to provoke you every once in a while because you do feel like slapping the arrogant policeman and your heart breaks when you see the hero do something self-destructive. Also, Satyagraha doesn't let its characters have it easy - they face opposition from outside and within their factions. Things do resolve themselves rather easily but the conflicts are brought up to point out that there are no easy solutions. So engrossed is Satyagraha in making its point that they couldn't be bothered with technicalities like editing, cinematography, etc.  Other than the fact that the screenplay is long-winded and takes a good two and a half hours to go through its business, there are things like sudden close-ups of actors, unnecessary songs that are extremely jarring, product placements and so on. However, there are times when the background score is subtle and invokes the intended emotion. At other times it is repetitive and too in-the-face for background music. So, here we are, another 'message film aimed at the common man' later. You will clap when the villain is slapped, you will cheer at the heros' smallest victories and the stands they take. You will sit through the speeches even though they bore you, because you acknowledge the truth in them. Then what?How about not bribing a law/admin official the next opportunity you are ""required"" to? ]"
218,"[Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam's documentary When Hari Got Married is a simple and unassuming film that follows 30-year old taxi driver Hari in the lead up to his arranged marriage. While the film does warm your heart, I'm still grappling with whether I want to recommend the film or not.Hari is set to marry a young girl named Suman. Though the couple doesn't ever get the chance to spend any time together prior to their marriage, Hari manages to get hold of Suman's phone number. Thus ensuring at least some level of 'courtship'. The phone conversations that Hari has with Suman and Hari's narration of his experiences as he goes through with the wedding preparations make you smile. Hari is resourceful and smart, yes. But he is also a simpleton, almost naive. (Then again, that naivety may only be an urban writer's perception of him, based on a few nuggets of his life captured on video.) As the film follows Hari and we acquaint ourselves with his uncomplicated worldview, we see just how traditional most of India still is.In fact, traditionalism and conservativeness apart, what comes through the most in the film is just how deep gender biases have penetrated our society. Suman, for example, properly sets eyes on Hari for the first time when she is actually getting married to him. It is endearing and a little heart-breaking to think of that diminutive little woman getting ready to spend her life with a man who she wouldn't recognize unless he was pointed out to her.Even Hari, a good man no doubt, still seems to think that the wedding is an ordeal for the man more than the woman. He gives off the air of someone who is about to accept a burden more than anything else. And it isn't his fault really; it is about his surroundings and where he comes from.Credit, then, to the filmmakers Sarin and Sonam, who don't try to milk the story for any sensationalism or for highlighting any burning issues plaguing small-town India. Their focus is Hari and his wedding, and everything else is about the flavour and texture of all that goes with it and the place and culture of where the film is set. The film, then, is more like a wedding video than anything else.And that, primarily, is what causes me to be unsure of how much I should recommend this film. It is honest, endearing and mature, but what does one truly take away from the film, apart from the fact that we know Hari and Suman had an arranged marriage? Little else, to be honest. Personally speaking, though, I'm glad that I now know about the existence of Hari, Suman and their angelic daughter somewhere in the hills of Dharamsala; because they will find a place in my prayers henceforth. ]"
219,"[The biggest fallout of something terribly mediocre doing well is that it spawns a whole generation of mediocrity based on the same theme, with the aim of cashing in on the mania. The Twilight franchise, then, is the torchbearer for teen romances dolled up with monsters and/or fantastical adventure settings. So Twilight led to another franchise Hunger Games (which, I must admit, was guilty fun) of which the second film is on its way, and the recent other Stephenie Meyer adaptation, The Host. The latest to follow this trend is The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones - the first film adaptation from a set of books by Cassandra Clare. So exhaustingly inane and utterly ridiculous is the film that when I walked out, I couldn't believe I had only been in there for only a little over two hours. Now, I'm scared of just how many books are left in the series. This first film hasn't even had time enough to gather all of its brickbats, but the sequel is already underway.Clary is a typical teenager with typical teenage problems - or so she thinks. Clary and her geeky best friend Simon get drawn into a world of werewolves and vampires and magical portals; a world where even Bach was supposedly a Shadowhunter and wrote music that could tell a demon apart by its reaction to it - no, I'm not making this up. Packed with so much exposition, explanation, back-story and mythology, but with cliches that rival all of this in equal measure - the film is such a cumbersome watch. It just never eases up on the levels of idiocy it so inevitably keeps crossing. I haven't read the source material, so I don't know; but it seems like a lot of this has more to do with the direction than with the original novel. Harald Zwart, director of Agent Cody Banks and Jaden Smith's The Karate Kid, directs this film with what seems like alarming intent to ensure that it never separates itself from the other typical teen movies I mentioned earlier. This is the kind of film where it begins raining indoors in the middle of a kiss. It is, of course, conveniently attributed to something else later, but the point was clearly the kiss in the rain. The film also keeps giving you a Harry Potter-Constantine deja vu, which isn't necessarily a good thing. Apart from never being able to shake off the been-there-seen-that feel, the film just doesn't seem to have an original word in its screenplay. The film does have some interestingly executed VFX pieces, but that's just the opposite of me nitpicking - I was left determinedly hunting for anything at all to take away from the film. With its generous display of hooded or skeleton-shaped gargoyles and statues and a camera that continuously seems to want to establish setting with every new scene, the film tries hard to create a sense of foreboding and danger - which I admit does happen once in a while. However, anything good achieved comes undone with the next familiar fantasy-teen-romance-trope or next annoying back-story-exposition that the film takes you through.It doesn't help that the performances in the film are as mundane as can be. Even the known faces, Lena Headey and Jonathan Rhys Meyers amongst others, are left with roles that often make you wonder how they kept a straight face through it. The young trio who are left with the task of carrying the film give it their all, but there's only so much one can do when everything else around is how it is in this film. The film is just so draining and wearisome, that every time you spot the Mortal Cup that everyone's running after, you wish you had some strong wine to go with; downing a cup would make this film infinitely more tolerable.]"
220,"[If there's one thing that one just has to grant the makers of Now You See Me, it is the fact that it seems like such a rarity these days to get a big, star-studded, concept flick that isn't a sequel, reboot, remake or adaptation. That isn't to say that Now You See Me has very much going for it apart from this. Despite a hooking premise and a palpable sense of tension that it creates by always seeming to have one last trick up its sleeve, the film runs out of steam by overplaying its hand a tad too often.With its foot on the pedal from the word go, the film introduces us to four different street magicians who are all united by a mysterious hooded figure for a larger purpose; the Four Horsemen, as they are then called, begin pulling off a series of grand illusions, with the continuous promise of coming back for the grandest deception of them all. Building up on sleight-of-hand tricks that we've seen ever so often (inspired from those by illusionist David Copperfield), the film coasts breezily along because of the mystery that it manages to evoke right from its initial frames. As one character after another is introduced, the proceedings begin to gain momentum, succeeding at least initially, in having you hooked. However, you know things are bound to go south when the film never eases up on the twists and turns, except for when it goes off on to a predictably cumbersome almost-romantic track between Melanie Laurent and Mark Ruffalo, who play Interpol and FBI agents respectively, both of whom are hot on the trail of the Four Horsemen. The film comes a cropper in its last act, when all of the build up, the deception and the grand journey leading up the climax - the prestige, if you will - turns out to be a bit of a damp squib, with the final few twists being predictable from a mile away. Also, the film has to be one of most miscast films in recent times, with some terrific actors playing bit roles that didn't deserve them, and which they could have played in their sleep. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine in particular, have particularly thankless roles. Even the characters played by Laurent and Ruffalo, for that matter, could have just as easily been played by anyone else. Having said that, both of them play their parts expectedly well.The Four Horsemen, played by Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco, do manage to pull off their characters fairly well. Eisenberg, in particular, seems to be a chameleon; I didn't think he could portray the suave, confident magician with the ease that he did. Fisher looks great, Harrelson is quirky as always, and Dave Franco seems a little rough around the edges, but he manages to hold fort. My biggest problem with the film, however, is how it misuses the audio-visual medium in an attempt to throw viewers off track from where it is heading, before rudely jerking them back with a twist out of the blue. Common tradecraft in big Indian as well as American films, where the fact that you can 'show' viewers something is misused blatantly by showing them something that doesn't really exist or by twisting the intent of the visual, to confuse them. (Think of all those times a character has turned his back on others in the scene to give a 'mysterious' expression that only the audience can see, only to never be referred to again in the film, or later explained away with some unconvincing bit of back story.)This film literally derives its trickery from this concept. Alfred Hitchcock's favourite term, 'MacGuffin', used to describe this device, sounds innocuous enough, but is something that I've personally had a problem with if not achieved cinematically. Now You See Me is pretty much one grand MacGuffin after another, shamelessly used throughout the film (and not to very good effect, I might add, if I could still spot some of the twists way before they even revealed that a twist was coming).Despite these hiccups that pepper the film, Now You See Me isn't really unwatchable, because of a premise that genuinely held potential and a few moments that do make you sit up and wonder. If you don't mind being played for a while and deceived more often than you'll remember once the film is done, then you might just have some guilty fun. Otherwise, I suggest you wait for the film to come out on satellite or DVD, and go back to the 307th word of this review, for a film that I'd recommend instead. ]"
221,"[You can tell the writers of Fukrey are in love with their characters and it is a joy to see the writers so invested in their characters. Except they get carried away. The introduction is so slow that even when fun quirkiness sets in, you have to literally been jerked out of drowsiness. The character exposition is so tardy and lacklustre that you wonder how you are going to spend the next two hours. And while it is good to see writers who care so deeply about the audience's understanding of the characters, they don't go beyond the initial set-up. As the movie develops, you don't really discover anything new, let alone interesting about most of the characters. However, as the movie progresses a couple of characters get into their element and bring life into the film, Chucha (Varun Sharma) and Bholi Punjabi (Richa Chaddha). Their characters' quirks and the language they use add zing to the film. That Chucha uses his dreams to win lotteries combined with his outlandish sense of humor, gradually wake you up and you begin to expect a peak in the film's comedy.  Bholi's brash lady-goon reminds you of Neha Dhupia's Munni gangster from Phas Gaya Re Obama and you are happy that you are enjoying her role better. She seems more at home with the language and the mannerisms.Yet, only two characters and the actors who perform them can take a movie only so far. Also ultimately, the movie wants to become greater than what it has been so far and forces a message in. In addition, there is this fact that all the main characters are pretty much losers who you don't feel much for or identify with. Sure, the two characters take away a lot of the credit, but the other actors do a great job too. Especially the women, Vishakha Singh and Priya Anand. I especially enjoyed scenes between Priya Anand and Pulkit Samrat where they communicate with their eyes. Hilarious and romantic moments at the same time. Also,though  Pankaj Tripathi's role seems too small to warrant an actor of his calibre, he of course, does well with what he has.Yet, with all that's going well for Fukrey, at 2.5+ hours, there is a lot that isn't. There isn't enough for you to warrant a trip to the theaters. Finally, I'll always remember Fukrey as the film that started with a guy peeing and cracking some toilet joke. Even so, a film in which the director and writer tried. A DVD watch where you can skip the first half sounds more like it. ]"
222,"[After two weeks of typical masala fare, anything ""different"" is more than welcome. And that's exactly what Madras Cafe is - different - something that hasn't been tried too often in India; a real-life incident from recent history fictionalised but put forth with as much realism as is possible; the politics behind the incident is deciphered to some extent. For that I admire the makers for investing the time, money and talent in this project. Yet, ultimately as a film, Madras Cafe's narration seemed like I was narrating a horrifying news item to my kids - simplified; episodic; brought down to their level; without getting into too much detail yet pointing out the necessary elements. In its treatment, Madras Cafe reminds you of the numerous political thrillers from Hollywood which are very well-executed even if pulsing with drama. It keeps you engaged, has a texture that it maintains beautifully throughout the film, and of course, has its share of loopholes. It assumes a high regard for a certain position - in this case, it substitutes the President of the United States of America with the ex-Prime Minister of India. His importance and stake in the scheme of things is a given.There are a few other things that worked against the drama though. For example, at the very outset you know the outcome of the film. There is nothing to look forward to in terms of turn of events, there is nothing to hope against hope for. I couldn't help but wonder what if the film hadn't opened with Vikram's (John Abraham) take on things. I wonder if the build up to the same event would've been different, I wonder if there would've  been a better connect with the characters.Here you have someone you know nothing about in remorse about some deadly political event he was a part of. You are given a bit of his backstory but other than that you have nothing than your nationalism to connect to the happenings. The moment Jaya (Nargis Fakhri) makes a pretentious comment about anti-nationalism, you disconnect from her. And this is one of her first few lines in the film. Not that she has much to do later in the film, yet I was constantly looking for some way to be more involved. The first half of the film is narrated with fervor and is completely engrossing. The many events and characters keep you on your toes. The brief background of the situation that was steaming in Sri Lanka and the ethnic war was perfect both as a quick revision to those of us who knew of it and an introduction to those who didn't. Like I mentioned earlier, motivations and implications are explained efficiently. You are taken aback by the realism when you realise how overt a covert operation really is. It's not difficult to believe that that's how things must be in real life. So real that you forget it is John Abraham playing the role of secret agent, Vikram. This is by far his best performance. In addition, once you've walked out of the theater, you have to marvel at his gutsy decision of producing a film of this nature - this film is as devoid of masala as it gets.I am sure, the film had a number of things that aren't authentic but the dangerous situations in which our agents operate just glares at you. At the same time, you wonder if one agent's life is really considered precious enough for the entire R&amp;AW to put its men at stake.Moreover, later, the pace slackens off in the second half where Madras Cafe tries to delve into the emotions of the people who you aren't connected with. I don't have so much of a problem with slow-paced films as I have with inconsistency in the pace. It's like you have to apply a sudden brake when you are driving at top speed. For example, while you have a person kidnapped and released within five minutes, the methodology of decoding hidden messages is painstakingly and childishly described later in the film. Also, Madras Cafe tries to bring in the sentiments of the terrorists a little too late in the film, especially considering the film is very clear about where it stands on the issue. A one-liner takeaway at the end of the film only amplifies the fact that not enough time was spent on the other side. I think it is brilliant that a filmmaker/writer picks a side and sticks to it. Then, why the need to show the other side?On the other hand, I loved the other contrast that director Shoojit Sircar brings out. Every once in a while, in this place full of violence and turmoil you see a peaceful monk walk through as if he were in a monastery. Also, the contrast of the monstrosity of the terrorists/rebels agains the beautiful landscapes of Sri Lanka are captured beautifully by cinematographer Kamaljeet Negi. So, here we are, some things brilliant, others not so much. A film that insists on not naming names but is about the events that build up to the assassination of an ex-Prime minister of India in 1991 and not to mention releases in the week of Rajiv Gandhi's birthday. Nevertheless, a film I'm glad was made, even if there were things I didn't quite like. A film which I hope you will watch, even if you don't rush to the theaters. A film that makes me wonder about its timing, given the current political climate of the country. ]"
223,"[Marijuana and meth are for kids; cinema is the real deal. It doesn't take courage, insight, expertise or inexplicable talent to create a film that makes a statement about existence, life, politics and about the deteriorating state of affairs in what we so naively call 'real life'. All it takes is cinema itself. What can stir up the deepest, most stagnant corners of our insipid souls than love? And what can make us reminisce about the farthest, most forgotten stories of love in our own lives than music? Qaushik Mukherjee (or Q, as he calls himself,) leaves Gandu far, far behind with his Tasher Desh, an adaptation - I call it that only, perhaps, because of my limited vocabulary - of a Rabindranath Tagore play of the same name. I must confess, my only exposure to the play prior to watching the film was reading its name in mere passing, in one of my many online excursions way back in time. Surely, though, I doubt even Tagore would ever have imagined his play brought to life in this manner.At its best, Tasher Desh is a scathing commentary on everything that is wrong with mankind today. At its worst, it is an unfathomable orgy of images and sounds that can either intrigue you or put you off, depending on which end of the spectrum of creative freedom you stand on. You might either walk out of the film because you just don't get it, or you might stay till the end, trying to decipher meaning and wisdom from the startling visual and aural experience that you've been subjected to. Either way, it's okay - because even the fundamental differences between right and wrong are but subjective in nature.To even briefly talk about the 'story' of the film would be to do thorough disservice to it; although the film's one line premise would read much like Tagore's play - a Prince and his friend (sidekick, conscience, alter-ego, who knows?) attempt to break free from the questions that plague them, ending up in a distant land across the sea - a land inhabited by the Card people; a race bound by rules and order. If you think this description is mysterious, wait till you watch the film.The first thing about the film that instantly grabs you is the three distinct colour tones used in the first hour of the film - a black-and-white look that has a narrator who wants to put up a production of Tasher Desh; washed out colour showing the Prince, his friend and his mother, the Queen, who are characters from the play; and the trippy, outlandish explosion of colour which seem to show the states of mind of the characters from the play. (This third colour tone was reminiscent of the hallucinogen-induced imagery from the 2012 film Dredd - enough to spawn at least some amount of clarity amidst the befuddlement.) The appearance of these three colour tones is seemingly random; images are cut and juxtaposed with alarming alacrity. The film will either draw you in right then, or you will reject it as indulgence (an innocuous, frequently-bandied term that few realize is far more subjective than simply 'good' or 'bad'.)In the second hour, in trying to show a land with order, the film descends into absolute chaos. Even the subtitles assume a life of their own, visually as well as in meaning. And yet, within this chaos, one can see the beauty of pure, uncorrupted anarchy - of self-governance and of self-censorship. Indeed, wouldn't the world be a far more tolerable place if every person has sense enough to control and govern his or her own behaviour?Here, in this second hour, is when the film comes into its own. It is no-holds-barred in its approach towards the narrative and the message it gives out; and yet it refrains from being sermonizing. It asks as much as it tells, and it urges you to see for yourself the glaring, dismal truth of the land it portrays. The images and sounds are rapid and urgent; the unraveling of these images and sounds, however, is leisurely. After all, it is ultimately a film - a world-view, a state of mind. The music of Tasher Desh is another tale of trip altogether. The songs are supposedly from Tagore's play itself, but the eclectic, fusion rendition of the songs, combined with lyrics that are all Tagore, truly propel the narrative; the music is easily the soul of the film. To put it mildly, Tasher Desh is daring for an Indian film. I don't know about the rest of the world, but I sure won't judge you for not liking it. In fact, I would go so far as to request you to stay away from Tasher Desh; because it is likely the kind of high you won't be able to handle.]"
224,"[The 2010 Kick-Ass, directed by Matthew Vaughn, caught attention because of how audacious it was in the violence and profanity-laced comedy it had to offer. It has since gone on to acquire something of a cult status. (If I remember correctly, it had also made it to Quentin Tarantino's 'Favourite Movies of 2010' list.) Though I wouldn't call myself a fan of the first film by any stretch, the film had quite amused me with its brand of no-holds-barred comedy and violence. (Not to mention that I'm always enamoured by the superhero concept, even if the treatment is tongue-in-cheek.)The problem with the sequel, which has a new director in Jeff Wadlow - and which one can question the very existence of, apart from obvious financial reasons - is that it sorely lacks what set the first film apart. Audacity. The violence, comedy and outlandishness of the plot have been toned down to make it a bit more dramatic instead, with high school identity problems, paternal issues and the likes taking centre-stage instead. The film does have a few laughs to offer, of course, and with its runtime just a shade over a 100 minutes, it mercifully doesn't test your patience too much, despite the odd cringe-worthy moments. Though the pace of the film is largely brisk, it really slows down when it pretends to look at the serious issues. You're always waiting for everyone to come to terms with their identities already, so that they can get on with what makes the film fun - the ludicrous humour and action. Every character stays well over-the-idiomatic-top and that really is what makes the film a tolerable watch. Aaron Taylor-Johnson reprises Dave, and is still adorable. Chloe Grace Moretz pretty much steals the show as Hit Girl, with her action as well as spontaneous lines. Nicholas Cage, who played Hit Girl's goofy father Big Daddy in the first film, is sorely missed. But to make up for his absence is the presence of one of my favourite movie stars of all time. I won't reveal who, because I must confess, I had no idea he was in this film before I watched it. In case you don't either, then I don't want to ruin the surprise for you; because I nearly jumped out of my seat to cheer when he first appears in the film.Apart from the appearance of said movie star, the best moment of Kick-Ass 2 for me, was a line that appears on Dave's t-shirt late in the film - again, something I'd rather you discover for yourself. Though Kick- Ass 2 is nowhere close to the first film, if you enjoyed the Kick-Ass, there is a possibility that you'll like this one as well. Otherwise you might find the film too profane, too violent or just too silly. Some, though, just call that 'niche'. ]"
225,"[There is no escaping this undeniable truth; if you use a personal computer or a smartphone - no matter what the brand or the operating system - it means that your life has been touched by Steve Jobs. And those are just two of the many, many fields of technology, innovation and creativity that the man has had an indelible impact on. Considering his charisma, the phenomenal graph of his story, the anecdotes and myths that surround him and the sheer legend that he became in life and in death, it would seem that making a terrific biopic on him would be a breeze. Well, apparently not.Joshua Michael Stern's screen adaptation of the life and times of Steve Jobs is a bit of a mess. A superficial account of one of our most iconic contemporary figures, it proceeds like a soulless, humourless recounting of some key incidents and moments in Jobs' life, without ever pausing to give the viewer even an ounce of insight into what actually made the man tick; what drove him to push everyone around to churn out their best and innovate, not electronic gadgets, but life extensions.Yes, Steven Jobs visited India early in his life, started Apple Computer in a garage, was forced to quit the company he co-founded and then returned in grand fashion and turned it around to make Apple the most valuable company in the world. Stern and writer Matt Whiteley seem to have said to themselves, ""We know all this. Let's just make a film!""When you even read, hear or talk about Steve Jobs, you're usually enthralled, impressed, confounded and inspired. It seems so strange to think filmmakers, with every audio-visual tool at their disposal to evoke emotions from viewers, can fail with a character that, through countless experiences of its life, seems tailor-made for not one but multiple screen portrayals.The key problem with Jobs is that of the choices - what to include in the film, how to treat it, how the narrative must be structured - it seems like none of these were paid any thought or attention to. Like the rest of us, the makers of the film assumed that Steve Jobs himself would power the film through. Clearly, the film subtracts from the great man, rather than adding to his persona in any manner. Considering how Ashton Kutcher was always a suspect choice to play Steve Jobs - he's never really been able to break away from being Kelso - he was about the only thing that at least makes you wait till the end of the film. His physical transformation is remarkable, even though he doesn't nearly capture the essence of Steve Jobs. His expressions - pursed smile, pursed frown, pursed everything - do give off the impression that he was trying too hard to 'be'. That becomes even more apparent with his gangly gait that is often shown in the film. Every other side character in the film is merely functional. Kutcher earns the film some brownie points, but nothing can take away from the fact that Jobs is one of the most disappointing films in recent times, particularly considering the fact that I actually was really intrigued by the trailer of the film. The good news, of course, is that we still have Aaron Sorkin's version to look forward to. Perhaps the person most disappointed with Jobs would have been Steve Jobs himself. For someone whose key mantra was innovation, his description of the banal treatment of his life story would probably have been the one word he always seemed likely to say. Sh*t.]"
226,"[The female lead character in Govinda is a woman named Shraavni (or Shravani; I'm not sure how it is spelled.) A vivacious, fun girl who doesn't take a second to turn tough when the time calls for it, who doesn't blink before making a sacrifice for the man she loves and yet one who doesn't particularly adhere to what our hypocritical society self-righteously defines as a 'good Indian woman'. Her character is easily the best thing about the film. Considering the rest of the film, though, I couldn't help wonder if, how the character turned out, was a bit of an accident.The man Shraavni is in love with is named Rajan; a street-smart, resourceful fellow who is supposedly studying for the MPSC exam, but is more interested in putting all of his time and effort into celebrating every Hindu festival with fervour. This, we're told, is what constitutes devotion to the almighty. What primarily brings this film down is the fact that, starting from the protagonist Rajan, every character in the film makes his character sketch abundantly clear, before going on to behave completely out of character at crucial junctures in the film.With a plot and treatment that would have seemed far more at home in the 80s, the film's intentions are no doubt noble. It wants to talk about principles like honesty and sincerity; about the responsibilities that are on your shoulders when you're in love with someone; about the importance of family and friends; about the necessity to preserve one's culture; about the plight of politics in our country; and perhaps about some other issues that I may have missed while trying to separate one from the other. In short, Govinda is a veritable potpourri of values that people probably don't have time for in this day and age. While director Aatmaram Dharne briefly skirts with all these morals and principles in the first hour, in the second hour he goes full throttle into shoving the various messages that the film wants to convey down the audiences' throats, with characters stepping out to deliver sermons in full seriousness. The film does hold your attention for longer than you expect it to, though. The primary reason for this is Swapnil Joshi's performance as Rajan. Despite his character's flip-flops - no, not footwear - he invests himself completely into Rajan. He does look a tad too old to be playing the age he supposedly is in the film, but you look past that because of Joshi's conviction in the character. Girija Joshi, who plays Shraavni, isn't particularly great. But you root for Shraavni nonetheless.Now technique has always been a problem with Marathi films because of their limited budgets, and this film is no exception. It bears a dated look throughout, and depends on far too many close ups to make up for the lack of production value. Indeed, sometimes one can't help feel a little sorry for the film, and hence be a little too lenient in judging it. But the sad truth is that some crisp, mature writing would have made it into a different film, its technical problems notwithstanding.Because of the film's 80s-style treatment and emphasis on values, the film may make for a fair family watch on satellite release - it has the kind of chest-beating traditionalism about it that the more self-consciously conservative amongst us might actually enjoy. However, that is precisely the kind of treatment that people are most likely to forget about the moment the film is over. One can't help feel that subtlety would have probably been more successful in making the message stick; particularly since contemporary India could undeniably do with some of the values the film speaks about.]"
227,"[A lady tells off a don, ""I am not a city, you can't own me."" It bothered me with Once Upon A Time in Mumbaai and it bothers me again with Once Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobaara - how exactly does one own a city like Mumbai? One wants to own it - I can try to imagine the magnanimosity of his aspirations. But when one claims to own it and everyone around him goes on for almost  three hours about how he owns it, you begin to really wonder how that works out? How does one own a city like Mumbai, let alone twice? Once I got over it, I warmed up to Once Upon Ay Time Mumbai Dobaara's style and drama, just a teeny-weeny bit. Not enough for sure, but not a complete washout either. The thing about a move which relies so heavily on its ""powerful"" dialogue is, you might indeed find four or five dialogues that invoke some kind of an emotion out of you. Either in its romance or skepticism or sarcasm or in its attempt at being profound, there might be a few lines in Once Upon Ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara that you just might remember. Only that you have to sift through tons of such lines including those delivered with enthusiasm by even the smallest of character artists. Whether or not you like it, you have to appreciate the dialogue writer's conviction at make every single line powerful. In fact, many situations and characters seem like they were created to accommodate the dialogue. Fortunately, there are other situations and characters that exist to build the themes of love, hatred and loyalty. Of the three the theme of loyalty is worked upon the most and works the best. The romance is rather lame and the hatred is purely functional. Given the huge conflict between loyalty and love, and the route Once Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobaara chooses to resolve the conflict, the film could've had a lot more impact. Despite the predictability, there was a lot of human element that could've been explored.But when style is a priority over content and stylish dialogue delivery over actual acting, the limitations are pre-defined. Even so, though the performances don't get you too involved with the characters, every once in a while, you do forget the actor who is playing it. You do loathe Shohaib for his audacity and for a bit forget it's Akshay Kumar on screen. This is actually a big deal considering the last few films that he has done. Imran Khan too manages to  invoke some kind of sympathy towards Aslam, even if momentarily. Sonakshi Sinha helps Jasmine hold her own against the man who owns Mumbai Dobaara and for what its worth, she does give Akshay Kumar a tough fight with her screen presence.Unfortunately, the romance has zero chemistry. There is more chemistry between Akshay Kumar and Sonali Bendre and him and Sophie Choudry in the little time they are given than Sonakshi Sinha has with either of the men. Yet, the fault doesn't lie in the performances, the writing and the choice of situations to depict romance lack oomph, despite all the superfluous style. So, laden with heavy dialogue that is attempted at by one and all, with a heavy voice, Once Upon Ay Time In Mumbai Dobaara isn't as random as the first episode, yet it doesn't suck you in despite having the potential to do so. ]"
228,"[UpdateI was slightly disappointed that the DVD of The Conjuring (a single DVD pack, as usual), had only one special feature - a roughly 8-minute segment titled 'Scaring the @$*% Out of You'. Pretty much a 'making of', the video does give a glimpse into director James Wan's style of work, but it leaves you wanting more. Considering how much effort went into the look, feel and the design of the scares, a more comprehensive featurette would have been wonderful. Also, the DVD doesn't have audio or subtitle options in any Indian languages, which is a pity.It is left to the movie, then, to make the DVD of the film a collectible. The Conjuring, for me, is one of best horror films in recent times, and that becomes even more apparent while watching it for the second time on DVD. Despite knowing exactly how the film is going to pan out, it still manages to involve you in the period, the location and the characters. James Wan is an exciting director to watch out for in the horror space, because he knows how to use familiar tropes well, and he really paces the horror elements well. The Conjuring is must-own for fans of horror! * A film that announces, right at the start, that it is based on a true story, always tends to make you shift in your seat with some anticipation. And when that film delves into the supernatural, you are bound to be even more intrigued. One of the big tragedies of the life that I have spent almost wholly sucked into the world of cinema is the fact that the one genre which hasn't been able to penetrate deep into the corners of my soul is horror. I've never been terrified while watching a horror film, which also means that I'm usually the wrong person to be doling out opinions on whether a film is scary or not. Horror, for me, is an extension of the thriller genre, and that's usually how I judge every horror film. The Conjuring, then, draws you into a dark world, hooks you and lets you go feeling quite, well, thrilled.Based on a hitherto untold true story from the case files of famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren - who were also involved in investigating The Amityville Haunting, amongst other 'famous' real life supernatural stories - The Conjuring sets itself up with a familiar premise - a family of seven (a couple with five daughters) moves into a new house and begins to experience strange occurrences almost as soon as they do. The Warrens are brought in to look into the matter, even as the haunting begins to assume proportions they hadn't experienced so far in their professional lives investigating paranormal phenomena.In the hands of genre expert James Wan - Saw and Insidious are the two films of his I've watched earlier, and both are good fun - The Conjuring doffs its hat to The Exorcist, but uses silences and pauses as its greatest weapons in attempting to scare the audience. It uses minimal music but familiar startling visual tropes that keep building up in frequency and intensity through the film. What I really liked about The Conjuring is the fact that it has a nice graph - a slow build up, a gripping middle and a conclusive, definite resolution. Also, the film is set in the early 70s, and it manages to create a nice feel for the time period with its grainy look, colour tone and production design. What also sets The Conjuring slightly apart from most other recent horror films is that it makes you invest emotionally in not just the family that is being haunted, but also with those who are called in to help the family in their distress - you root for both parties equally - because there is always the unshakable feeling that both parties have something at stake.However, it is Vera Farmiga, who plays Lorraine Warren, that's easily the best thing about the film. Blessed with the most charming, pleasing and warm screen presence, she is almost like the shining beacon of hope in The Conjuring. To borrow a term from the Harry Potter series, she's almost like a Patronus - a guardian against negativity and evil. Patrick Wilson, a frequent star in James Wan's films, creates a credible aura of support as Ed Warren. Mostly though, The Conjuring is the kind of film that works because of the ambiance it creates in the cinema hall. Barring those who attempt to mask their fear by indulging in loud commentary and lame humour, the film unites the audience in its gasping reactions to what is being witnessed. For that experience alone, The Conjuring is best watched in the theatre, in the last possible night show that you can find. Go for it then; I envy you for the fun you'll have, while I deal with my own ironical curse of non-scary horror.]"
229,"[For films like Chennai Express, reviews are futile, I accept. Fans of the star/director/genre are going to watch the film come what may. The rest of us couldn't be bothered with reading a review, let alone watching it. Sympathies with the latter group if you have ""loved"" ones in the former group who drag you into the theater kicking and screaming. May your 142 minutes rest in peace, or not. In that sense, Chennai Express delivers exactly what is expected -- histrionics by Shah Rukh Khan;  - beauty and gorgeousness by Deepika Padukone;  - loads and loads of buffoonery;  - bold, bright, solid colored costumes, art-work and props;  - slapsticky dialogue that trots around self-importantly;  - and some peppy song and dance.  As complete as any Rohit Shetty film is. Well, sans Ajay Devgn. So, you don't have his cool personality to bring calm or at least a break from the over-the-top state of affairs. Even otherwise, Shah Rukh Khan's facial contortions (except for when he has this one romantic twinkle in his eyes) remind me of our origins as a race. Here, he is actually supposed to make you laugh with all the monkey business. Yet, despite all my apathy towards the tomfoolery, there was one scene that got me the goose bumps. Of course, it was too little too late.It doesn't help that not only are the jokes as predictable as every other SMS joke, the self-referencing SRK one-liners are predictable too! For the rest of the dialogue you are left with emotional/philosophical lines sound like they were picked from a book of quotes. What could have been funny if it happened once, either repeats itself or goes on for too long to kill whatever little joy it started with.You wonder then, whether or not you should complain about half the film being in Tamil. I have no clue if the heavy mockery of what the Tamilians wear, how they speak, what they eat, how they eat is offensive. But I didn't find it in good taste. The only one trying to add grace to everything else, is Deepika Padukone. Since, I don't know if her diction was right or not, I can only say she didn't look convincing. Maybe, because it was apparent that she was trying really hard.Through her character, an attempt is made to send a message across to the men of the nation. But again, the setting is way too off the topic for most of the length of the film to suddenly become about a particular social issue. All you can do is thank Rohit Shetty for small mercies - for having at least tried to make the film about something, a little less random.After this gratitude then, all you can do is come out feeling happy that it wasn't worse than you expected. And at least, the crowd around you, the people this film is made for had a good time. ]"
230,"[Sixteen tries to be cool and the effort shows. The labour that such an effort requires shows through every department of the film and not in a good way. It's a film where everyone is trying their best, but unfortunately their best is only mediocre. Sixteen gives itself an air of importance. A sense that it is making some very crucial points. But it does so in such a disconnected manner, as if trying to symbolise the disconnect that the characters have towards most things around them. This doesn't allow you to feel with or for them. Maybe some sixteen year olds will identify with some of the characters, but I am not sure anyone is going to find more than a half-way affection.The first put-off is the dialogue delivery of all actors, except for maybe Zakir Hussain. The three lead ladies have a drawl that is annoying at first and then it becomes drab. It doesn't help that the dubbing is completely off. There is this a drunk scene with Wamiqa Gabbi who plays Tanisha where she shows some scope of doing something other than the regular drawl but that's too little to shake off the lazy way in which the lines are said.The sad bit is that there is potential. Some of the story lines, especially that between Tanisha and the paying guest (Keith Sequeira), had enough material to make for a film by itself. But, the writers had the burden of keeping the other stories going and the editors do a shabbier job of sticking them together. Sequences are literally stuck together.There are other times when the conversation has potential to get deep, introspective and interesting despite the awful dialogue delivery but it fizzles out. Anyway, I am not sure it'd have helped the broad stroke that every single sixteen year old is a weird shade of cool. I know a bunch of 15-16 year olds. They are confident, arrogant even. They don't value money as much as we did when we were that age. But, I doubt that they are as out there as the kids shown in Sixteen. Of course, I don't deny that teenagers do tend to have a casual attitude towards everything around them, but that can't be true of all them. Where are these represented in Sixteen? And if the film is not about those kids, then why have all characters that are pretty much the same, give or take. Then again, maybe all of real-life teenagers have another side that we as adults don't know about, just like the parents in this film.]"
231,"[Update:I happened to catch Gangster Squad on DVD and here's an update on the DVD features.Packed in an unassuming case, the single dual-layer disc that holds the film as well as its solitary 'Special Feature', the DVD of Gangster Squad doesn't make for a collectible in any way. A film that was panned by most critics, but one that I found to be a brisk watch even the second time round, Ruben Fleischer's period gangster noir flick is quite simply about the coolth of it. Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling and Sean Penn hold their own, and the film has a nice post-war LA feel, right down to tiny details, that quite appealed to me. The film on DVD is darker than I remember it being on the big screen, and it killed some of the beautiful shadows that stood out in the big screen watch. The true disappointment, of course, is the poor excuse for a 'Special Feature'. A 4 minute-42 second featurette called 'Tough Guys With Style', it is pretty much a 'Making Of', one that has no substance in it whatsoever. It just has a few lines from key cast and crew about the whys &amp; hows of the look-and-feel of the film; it amounts to nothing at all. Expectedly, the DVD also has 5.1 Dolby Digital sound as well as subtitles, in English and a number of foreign languages. And for those who have DVD players/drives with limited number of Region changes available, you must know that the Gangster Squad DVD is in Region 2. While I don't recommend the DVD of the film, the film itself will always be one of those where I disagreed a bit with the general negative opinion. Most hated it, whereas I didn't quite mind it, primarily because of the period feel and the cast.~ ~ ~ ~ ~A film that was heavily delayed because of the Aurora shootings - it underwent considerable reshoot in the wake of the incident - Ruben Fleischer's Gangster Squad finally hits theatres this week. A pity, since January is usually considered the worst month to release movies the world over. Gangster Squad is the first new film I've watched on the big screen in 2013, and though it isn't a great film by miles, I'd still like to believe that 2013 at the movies is off to a decent, even if a slightly stuttering, start.Welcome to post-World War II Los Angeles, a place where even shadows ooze glamour; where three-piece suit and Fedora wearing gangsters rule the roost, the law be damned. And East Coast don Mickey Cohen is laying the groundwork for his domination of the 'Wild West', ousting the existing crime lords in the city. Enter an upright, tough-as-nails cop John O'Mara, whose only aim is to make LA a safe place to live again, for his child to grow up in. When it looks like Cohen just cannot be stopped, O'Mara is entrusted with the responsibility of forming a small extra-judicial team to take care of matters in whatever way they deem fit.With a plot like that, supposedly based on a true story, and the kind of cast that this film has, it is hard to not make a film that entertains. Add to that the manner in which the makers manage to get the period feel right - Plymouths, Tommy Guns, glamorous bars with neon lights, the works - and what you end up with is a fun couple of hours at the movies. The action scenes are effortlessly cool; some of the scenes are virtually orgies of booming gunshots. There is even one superbly shot chase sequence involving cars that were not really meant for chase sequences. The film is helped immensely by the cinematography and VFX. A majority of the film is shot at night, so there is generous play of lights. The manner in which the light supposedly caused by gunshots is used to light scenes and shots is particularly interesting. The use of the background score is excellent as well. The instruments and orchestral feel go well with the period and the tone of the film.But what truly keeps the film interesting is the cast. Sean Penn steals the show as Mickey Cohen; he injects the character with an electric quality, breathing unapologetic malice and pretending to have a sense of humour even when he does not. Josh Brolin is superb as the honest, posterior-pounding Sgt. John O'Mara. Ryan Gosling, easily one of the most exciting young Hollywood actors at the moment, seems to be having a whole lot of fun as the icy cool cop who falls in love with the most dangerous girl he could find. His body language is what makes him stand out as an actor. Watch as he casually leans against a wall in the midst of a messy fight scene; he keeps reminding you why he is an actor to watch out for. The supporting cast does a great job as well. Robert Patrick and Giovanni Ribisi, who play members of Brolin's team, are excellent. Emma Stone as Cohen's moll looks great, but has a small part in what is essentially a film about the men.As usual, the film's biggest problem is the heavily flawed writing. The screenplay is riddled with flaws and leaps of faith, too many to count actually. The manner in which Gosling's character agrees to be a part of the team, the way in which the Gangster Squad gets hold of their information about Cohen, the ridiculously skewed ratio of bullets fired to bullets finding their mark, these and a whole lot more require large doses of what we as the audience have come to dislike - looking the other way. In fact, the writing of the film is what truly pulls it down, ensuring that it never becomes memorable at any stage.Gangster Squad is a forgettable film, one that you wont be thinking about for too long once it is done. But there is good chance that you'll have some amount of fun while watching it; it has enough ingredients for that much at least. If, like me, you believe that the only real way to watch a movie is on the big screen, then go for it. There's a good chance you'll be entertained during its run time. Otherwise, the film will just as well make for a one-time watch on DVD. Then, I'd strongly recommend those who like this film to go on to catch L.A. Confidential, my personal favourite LA noir film by some distance.]"
232,"[Nitin Desai seems to enjoy being the proverbial fish out of the water. Following his acting debut last year, the celebrated art director's debut feature at the helm, Ajintha, hit theatres this week. Ambitious in scale and vision, Ajintha has technique going for it, but falls way short of being even a halfway decent watch, primarily because of its writing and direction.The film opens in the jungles of Ajintha, where a Captain James Smith of the British Army, accompanied with a team of tribals, makes an important discovery - caves over two millennia old, containing carvings and paintings depicting the various incarnations of Lord Buddha. Keen on promoting this discovery, the British decide to send a soldier, who also happens to have some skill with the paintbrush, to recreate the paintings and sculptures, so that they can be exhibited and the caves popularized.Thus, Captain Robert Gill arrives with his easel and canvas to the caves of Ajintha, to create his own version of the masterpieces. With the beauty of his new environment comes Paro, a tribal girl with a sad past, capturing his imagination with her innocence, becoming his muse and the source of his creativity. There is no denying that the premise of the film had a lot of scope. Unfortunately, an unforgivably incoherent screenplay combined with a rather weak directorial hand causes the result to be clumsy, pointless and boring. The dialogue of the film is especially clunky, with a lot of them unintentionally causing a large section of the audience to guffaw uncontrollably. In fact, there was one large stretch in the middle where the audience made me feel like I was watching Vicky Donor again, even though there was nothing remotely funny going on, on screen.Nitin Desai's wish to make this film indulgent and 'arty', if there is such a thing, clearly shows - long circular trolley shots around characters to bring forth their mental turmoil; thin lines between dreams and reality where large sets seem to exist one moment and disappear the next; attempts to bathe characters in shafts of light; the works. Ajintha is virtually a case study of the fact that even decades of being a celebrated technician and being associated with some of the best films and filmmakers in the country doesn't necessarily give you the ability to direct your own film.If there is someone who brings forth a shred of credibility in the film, it is the young British actor Philip Scott Wallace, who plays Robert Gill. In spite of being saddled with some ungainly English dialogue, he seems to have invested himself into his character of a soldier with artistic leanings, who falls in love with an Indian tribal girl. Sonalee Kulkarni, the actress who plays Paro, is a different matter altogether. Not particularly good with her acting, she doesn't even come close to looking like what one would imagine a rustic, wild tribal beauty to look like. The problems with Ajintha, then, are pretty elementary really. The film has no graph, no moments that hook you, no real takeaway. Apart from some well-designed and constructed sets, a few beautiful frames and some intriguing background music, Ajintha has very little going for it for it to make a mark either critically or commercially. This one can safely be given a miss.]"
233,"[There are indie films and there are indie films. And then there is writer-director Anand Gandhi's Ship of Theseus. Perhaps the singularly most impressive independent film to come out of India, Ship of Theseus is a sweeping philosophical, intellectual and emotional experience that demands the audiences' involvement from the very outset and in return rewards them with questions, answers and everything in between.The film traces three separate stories - three threads of life, ideology, spirituality and thought - into journeys that shake up the very basis of their characters' separate existences. A female photographer whose talent and fame stem from a very unique circumstance - a physical disability that few would be able to overcome in such a positive manner; a monk whose ideological beliefs - that of non-violence and animal rights - face a stern test of faith; a young stockbroker whose notions of morality begin to spiral inwards as he unwittingly gets drawn into an illegal kidney trade racket. Anand Gandhi makes us dwell in these characters' minds and inhabit their worlds, makes us get to know their worldview intricately and, most importantly, he makes us a part of the journey that these characters have to undertake. And these journeys don't have a definite end - you just live with the characters long enough to know that, for better or for worse, their experiences have changed them.Another thing that fascinated me about the film at a far more personal level was how the entire film breathes Mumbai. The stories themselves could have been set in any city in the world - they are universal. But - and I am only speculating here - it appears that Anand Gandhi shares a bond with the city of Mumbai that reflects in how it is just always present, gently undulating under the surface of the film. What helps the film immensely is the cast. Though they are largely unknown faces in Indian cinema, each of them is convincing. Aida El-Kashef, Neeraj Kabi and Sohum Shah play the three main characters mentioned earlier. Each of them is so convincing in their roles that it often doesn't seem like they are playing characters at all. Their presence and spontaneity play in a large role in drawing the audience's involvement into the film. Also a host of charming supporting characters that are wonderfully performed are like icing on the cake.While the film can clearly hold its own at the international stage in terms of thought, what makes it even more special is that even technically, one doesn't feel that the film can't compete internationally. Pankaj Kumar's cinematography needs to be lauded for that. Each of the stories has its own visual language specific to the character and his or her environment, and yet they merge beautifully in the larger context of the film. Yes, I did feel that the film could easily have had a crisper cut. There is an excess of visuals that makes the film a tad too long. Personally, I would perhaps have shaved off a good 10 - 15 minutes of the film to make it tauter. Perhaps the best thing about Ship of Theseus is that it has introduced Anand Gandhi to the world. Clearly, he is a man who thinks - a rare breed in Indian cinema. As many brain-dead people and films we come across, there are an equal number of pseudo-intellectual cinephiles with an unfounded conviction in what they believe is good cinema. It takes a passionate, philosophical thinker to understand that rules - and how to break them - are decided by human beings. Right and wrong are constructs of the human mind. Morality and justice always have two sides to it, just like the inseparable duality of life and death. Gandhi talks about all these themes in his film, hopefully the first of many more to come. Hopefully, it will also inspire and spawn the rise of more independent, thinking filmmakers. Just for this hope that he has instilled into us, with the arrival of Ship of Theseus, we as lovers of cinema must rejoice.]"
234,"[When you walk out of a film, whether or not you like it, you come out with a sense of what the film was about, what it wanted to say or do. That it succeeded or failed for you, in the way it was narrated, is a different matter. Issaq doesn't give you the chance to assess the latter bit. You just are left wondering what it was all about. Is it a love story with a backdrop of politics? Is it a family feud? Is it about Maoists? You'd believe it most if you someone said it wasn't about anything at all.When a film is about something, it makes the ""something"" an innate part of its narrative. At the very least, In a romance, you'd feel like rooting for the couple. Instead, the crowd cheered when bad things happened to them, and not because they had grey shades in them. For me, it was worse, I was indifferent to what happened to them.You have no clue why Rahul (Prateik Babbar) )and Bachchi (Amyra Dastur) are in love with each other. You don't know where their loyalties lie. Every time you feel you know what their next step will be, they do the exact opposite of what their character has been saying. That's not really the right kind of unpredictability. You just don't feel anything for them at all.To top it off, there is barely any chemistry between the two actors. Prateik Babbar's dialogue delivery is at its worst. The pauses he takes in the sentence make you feel like you are watching a primary school play. Amyra Dastur, in comparison, seems like an ace-rate performer, which she really isn't. Except for one scene which has her read out poetry, which she does a great job of, her performance doesn't get your attention at all. Unfortunately, this scene seems rather out of context and the performance is wasted in the context of the film.Similarly, a lot of things feel out of context. While it was disorienting enough to have South Indian Maoists in Varanasi, that they were portrayed as psychopaths and/or terrorists bothered me more. There was a disconcerting randomness about who they chose to kill. Prashant Narayanan, as the character who plays their leader, could walk through this one in his sleep. So, yeah, the film wasn't remotely about Maoism either.That leaves the political angle which is the funniest bit. You know more about Tittas (Ravi Kissen) the lover than the supposedly political sidekick that he is. You know even lesser about the two gangster-politicians  who you are asked to fear at the very beginning of the film. However, you are given nothing at all to fear them. In fact, more than once, they come across as meek, disable men.When all else fails, you usually have something in the technical departments to keep you going. The music, the dances, the action. No hope here, either. All you are left with is, one botched up scene after the other. In fact, the entire film, quite literally looks like, scenes were shot and sewn together in pretty much random order. For example, it felt like they had Prateik Babbar jump roof tops just so there could be an action element in the film. Oh well! Not that the world was expected from Issaq, so it's not like you come back disappointed. You just feel sad for the people who claim to take Romeo and Juliet to Varanasi.]"
235,"[No matter how strong or how fast you get, you just can't outrun your own inner demons. And Logan has stranger, darker demons, and for far longer to boot, than most other people - if you can classify him under 'people', that is. The brooding, sombre mutant is back, and he's still being haunted by the ghosts of his past.Despite Logan being, by some distance, my personal favourite character from the X-Men series, I must confess that I didn't have too many expectations from The Wolverine, because there have been far too many X-Men films coming out far too soon, than the world strictly requires. Besides, a few years back, director James Mangold managed to do the impossible by making the first and only Tom Cruise film I dislike, in Knight and Day. I'm unsure, then, if it was my low expectations or the fact that it actually is a film with its own merit, but I quite enjoyed The Wolverine. For one, it has far lesser action than one has come to expect from an X-Men film, or indeed, a film based on any Marvel/DC character or world. The film focuses more on Logan, the character - a mutant whose gravest problems stem from deep within - from his past, his present and his seemingly perpetual future. With the film being set in Japan - mostly in Tokyo, before moving to the outskirts, The Wolverine also has a flavour of Japan that is undoubtedly superficial, but one that works in its favour. Capturing the flavour of a country or city that has its own distinctive culture is largely unexplored territory for a Hollywood film of this genre, and it thus makes for a refreshing change in this film.Indeed, the entire narrative of The Wolverine took me slightly aback with how much it focused on the character and his surroundings, rather on VFX-powered set pieces. The few of the latter that are there in the film are quite well executed as well, without bordering on action-porn, as films tend to do these days. Watch out, particularly, for an imaginative and riveting scene on the top of a thundering 'Shinkansen' - what is ubiquitously known as a Bullet train - again, something quite typical of Japan.It helps, of course, to have the towering presence of someone like Hugh Jackman to hold the film together. After Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, Jackman is the only other actor to have a made a comic book character so much his own that it's hard to imagine anyone else playing it. Also, after watching his incredible turn as Jean Valjean in last year's Les Miserables, my respect for him as an actor increased tremendously, and his intensity shines through in The Wolverine as well. Every performance around Jackman, though, is so stilted and effected that it jars. The pace of the narrative isn't breakneck, and yet the film never pauses and lingers around pointlessly either. The runtime of just over two hours thus seems about perfect. To round it off, the film also looks good - despite a bleak, de-saturated colour tone, it makes generous use of solar flares, which always seem to improve the look of even an averagely shot film. The film has a wider 3D release than 2D, so it's more likely that you'll end up watching a 3D show. The 3D isn't particularly great, but it doesn't hamper the film either. Of course, there is the post-credits scene to look forward to as well, an intriguing little teaser for Bryan Singer's X-Men: Days of Future Past, which is summer 2014's big release. So, if you're absolutely fed up of big franchise films that OD on VFX and action, then you could give The Wolverine a shot - it is a wee bit different from the usual. If nothing else, Logan - and Hugh Jackman - almost adamantly keep things interesting.]"
236,"[A father and his business partner egg the daughter to get a rich relative's son attracted to her. It sounds sleazier when they say it in Hindi. A mother of today's day and age, who has lived in Australia for years together doesn't once consider asking her son if he likes the girl she has chosen for him before giving her word to the girl's family. Even if such people exist in real life, what makes them interesting? Why would I want to watch them? I didn't like it back in the 90s, I can't stand it now.Even so, Ramaiya Vastavaiya does manage to bring a few smile, or laughs even, with Girish Kumar and his buffoonery. He brings about a childlike cuteness in his character, Ram. The kind of cutesy behaviour that is pretty annoying when an adult does it, but Girish Kumar carries it off quite a few times. And of course, there are other times when it doesn't work at all.Unfortunately, those other times pretty much make for the entire film. Ramaiya Vastavaiya is almost continuously trying really hard to be funny. It goes over the top, loud and unbearable at most times. There are a few instances with the lead pairs sidekick's becoming butt of jokes. Or another character whose always on the phone and his side of the conversation is a funny remark on another parallel dialogue in the scene. All of this too though, works for a while and then it gets repetitive and thus stops being funny.Given that the situation of all villains being against the hero's love for his lady, by itself is nothing very exciting, it is marginally interesting that Ramaiya Vastavaiya has more than one villain, all with supposedly powerful personalities. So, you feel the hero getting cornered from all sides. But, what's the point if the most intimidating one backs off, just like that. Not even a courtesy couple of lines are lectured on to them to transform their take. The problem with love stories like Ramaiya Vastavaiya is that they fail to convince you of the undying love that the lead pair feels for each other. It is more like you are asked to believe they are so much in love rather than you feeling it. So, who are you going to root for? Certainly not for the woman who can't watch out for herself even when her life is at stake. Shruti Haasan as damsel-in-distress works only as much as any stereotypical damsel-in-distress would work.It's disheartening to see a film that mimics films made in the 90s. Especially, when you feel the ones in the 90s shouldn't have been made in the first place!]"
237,"[A bomb blasts, you  are disturbed. You want to do something about it but feel helpless and lost. We rant about it, we complain about the administration. Bloggers blog about it. And filmmakers, well, at least some of them make films to present their point of view. D-Day ultimately, comes across as a filmmakers rant. Writer-director Nikhil Advani sets up his characters in a rather dull manner. You know their sad stories, but you don't really care for them, till interval point. At break time, the twist suddenly makes you wonder what will happen to these characters. Thereafter though, instead of piquing the build-up, the narrative flattens. The pace of the action film slackens into moments of reflections by the characters. This is a shame because the turmoil of the male lead characters is played out really well. Thematically, this starts off with wonderful editing between a R&amp;AW mission and a song at a wedding. But, when such treatment is juxtaposed with the film's larger theme, the pace becomes very uneven. Uneven writing doesn't help the cause. Loyalties change; enemies find out each others' moves and companions; the incredible happens, just out of nowhere. Towards the end, D-Day comes across more as a fantasy of what ought to happen in the real world than trying to keep it real. Interestingly, the climax seems to be talking simultaneously to our administration of what they ought to do and to the terrorists warning them against what we could be capable of. And what about that is not going to go down well with the audience?A very capable Irrfan Khan and a flat-but-effective performance by Arjun Rampal are D-Day's high points. Rishi Kapoor does whatever he's asked to do with ease. Unfortunately, his character isn't menacing enough to give him room to instill fear. Huma Qureshi barely makes her presence felt. You really wonder if there is a reason other than equal representation in a spy team, for her to be included. Shruti Haasan, on the other hand, has a better, more meaningful role. Interestingly, her performance seems effective when she has shorter lines. Beyond a line or two and her accent begins to falter, which makes it very distracting.The number of songs, even while they play in the background are too many and slow down the proceedings considerably. The film lingers too much for an action film. Post-interval, the plot goes haywire and the editing loses grip except for a few sequences. Even in those wonderful sequences, it stretches a bit longer than optimum - enough to make you impatient.D-Day wants to be a stylish take on the psyche of the martyrs of this country while also trying to make a larger point about how terrorism ought to be handled. And, it also wants to be a thriller. Too much on one plate.]"
238,"[Sometimes, the mere thought of reboots, remakes and sequels coming out of Hollywood these days exhausts you. In fact, even complaining about it has become passe. That was quite how I felt before I watched Red 2, despite the fact that it stars some of the most dependable names you can think of. Now these names I'm talking about are terrific as usual. But, yet again, a predictable and contrived plot that meanders around itself for no apparent reason lets Red 2 down. It is fun in spurts, but never enough to truly elevate the film.Taking off from about where the previous film ended, retired CIA agent Frank Moses and call center employee Sarah are together now, trying to lead a quiet life. However, Frank is unexpectedly put on the run when he learns that he's a hunted man again, and it may have something to do with a Cold War weapons project. Then ensues the madness.Yes, there is the deadpan humour to keep you company throughout the length of the film. And there's Bruce Willis as Frank Moses, who always kicks behinds even when he's sleepwalking through his role. Most importantly, at least for me personally, there's Helen Mirren, who, in her brief role, shows the boys - Willis included - just how a gun must truly be handled on screen. Together with John Malkovich reprising his adorable character as Frank's friend Marvin and Anthony Hopkins who turns out the best performance of the film as the ex-scientist gone bonkers, the cast of the film ensure that at least you aren't shifting in your seats all throughout, waiting for the film to end.But the writing takes such blatant liberties and forces so many conveniences down your throat, that you're always questioning logic in the film, even though you know that you are just not supposed to. And I'm not just talking about the fundamental premise of near-sextagenerians numbering in single digits bringing down entire squads all by themselves. Every time our heroes so easily enter buildings, known to be heavily fortified with the best in security, then wreak mayhem there and escape unscathed, all for a purpose that seems almost pointless, all you can do is heave a sigh, and wait for the next bit of screenplay frivolity.Also, with action films being almost the norm of the day, it seems to have become very difficult to truly design and execute path-breaking action off late. Save for one fun car chase sequence that has Dame Helen Lydia Mirren once again adding some delightful - ahem - icing on the cake, even the action is of the deja vu variety. Director Dean Parisot, whose last theatrical feature was the watchable-but-forgettable Jim Carrey-starrer Fun With Dick and Jane, seems to specialize in precisely that kind of film. Besides, I couldn't help feeling, more than once, that this was a cast that was a little bit out of his league. They seemed to run on autopilot, without the firm hand of a director's vision guiding them. Or was I expecting too much there?Red 2, quite like its predecessor, would make for a passable DVD watch. In fact, purely because of the effortlessly charming cast, the two films back-to-back wouldn't make for a bad lazy afternoon double feature. But don't expect to walk in to the theatre and leave it feeling completely satisfied. ]"
239,"[If, like me, you stay right until the end of the credit roll of a film, right till the screen goes black, then the final title card of Pacific Rim will warm your heart. ""In memory of Monster Masters Ishiro Honda and Ray Harryhausen"", it says. Indeed, it wouldn't harm at all, invoking the memory of the man behind Godzilla and that of one of the pioneering masters of visual effects and animation, when what you're trying to achieve is on the scale of Pacific Rim.It takes a special kind of vision to imagine and execute a film with a canvas as large as Pacific Rim. Yes, it may be your typical Hollywood summer blockbuster film - humanity under threat from gigantic creatures they can't control, rallying back to take the fight to them, no matter what the cost. Been there, seen that and then some. Still, that doesn't stop it from being an exhilarating ride because of the sheer enormity of the frames that Mexican fantasy virtuoso Guillermo del Toro's vision brings to life.Del Toro doesn't waste much time anywhere in the film. The premise is established with documentary-style footage right in the first five minutes. Humongoid monsters called 'Kaiju' have risen from deep beneath the Pacific and made life on earth, hell. In counter, humankind develops massive war machines of their own, known as Jaegers. The Jaegers are match enough for the Kaiju, at least initially, until things start going south.In designing and executing the Kaiju-Jaeger world is where the film trumps all of its flaws. The atmospherics and scale of each fight sequence put every previous film in this genre to shame. Yes, Jaegers make Transformers look like little plastic toys. With terrific detailing in the universe that has been created, in the physics of the movements of machines and monsters larger than anything we've ever known and in the sheer mammoth planning of every action set piece in the film, it just doesn't let you pause to think about just how ridiculous the plot must have seemed at the script level.This is Del Toro in his element, displaying a familiarity and penchant for all things fantastical, going out there and making a film he believes in, and doing a terrific job with it. Yes, the film also attempts to deal with familiar themes of loss and redemption, of sacrifice and victory, of the triumph of the human spirit. In fact, every single time the film pauses to dwell on these bits is precisely where one is most likely to get bored in the film. Guillermo del Toro isn't particularly adept at breathing cinematic life into cardboard characters, and it seems like he hasn't tried too hard either. He just wants you to have a smashing good time at the cinemas, that is exactly what he promised, and that is exactly what he delivers.Save for Idris Elba, who plays the only character remotely able to evoke emotion from you, none of the other actors have anything to contribute to the film either. The only brownie points they get are for delivering some amusingly inane dialogue with a straight face. Let's get one thing clear, human beings are only there in Pacific Rim because otherwise, no matter how beautifully magnificent the actions scenes are, it would seem pointless to not have it serve a purpose; like the damsel-in-distress in a superhero film.But at the end of the day, the human beings are just a distraction in Pacific Rim. This is a film about monsters and robots. The Kaiju are so large that you never ever see even one of them fit into a frame in its entirety. The Jaegers are so gorgeously colossal that every single one of them will possibly either take your breath away, or make your jaw drop to the floor, or both. And every time a Kaiju and a Jaeger are in a frame together, the theatre screen simply looks too puny to hold them. They wrestle, tumble, hammer and fling each other like lumbering hulks, and every time one of the creatures lands on the ground, you can almost feel the earth rumble right to your heart. Yes, the astronomical order of events does get to you by the fag end of the film; the gargantuan magnitude of the monster-robot battles can get exhausting. There is simply too much size and too little actual content in the film for it to be a truly memorable experience. There's fun to be had, but don't expect to be moved or emotionally caught up with anything in the film. Quite like the Jaegers themselves, Pacific Rim is immense in dimensions, but doesn't have a beating heart. ]"
240,"[The audience goes ""oooh"", ""aaah"", and ""woohoo"" with every up and down that Milkha Singh goes through, in the first five minutes itself. And my heart goes along too. Yes, it is long. Yes, it has songs. Yes, it is dramatized, even over-dramatized at times. Except for the songs, all of it works for Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. Oh and yes, it is predictable too. But, then isn't that fact predictable in the first place? It is a true life story after all. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag makes a deliberate effort to balance between telling an inspirational story and not making it a boring History lesson. With the number of slow motion scenes and choreographed, lip-sync songs the makers might have gone a little overboard in trying to keep things interesting. Sure, if Bhaag Mllkha Bhaag were told as a ""He came. He Ran. He conquered."" story, it might have made for better cinema. But, would the risk of Milkha Singh's spirit reaching out to a smaller audience been worth it? So, this once, if having Milkha Singh dance while tapping his buttocks is what it takes, so be it. I am sure writer, Prasoon Joshi must have thought long and hard over what was left out of Milkha Singh's story and what was added. It is a shame that typical Farhan Akhtar-style PJs (Poor Joke) found their way in. From having seen him as himself on TV shows, the jokes instantly reminded me it was Farhan Akhtar I am watching. It took away from the otherwise gripping performance. Yeah, his accent doesn't flow naturally, it comes across as trained. His diction is slightly distracting - as it is when he speaks Hindi or English too. But, Farhan Akhtar smiles his charming smile to endear Milkha Singh to you. The upper teeth jutting forward give it, what I assume, a Milkha touch. You sense Milkha's pain and determination. You want him to go easy on himself when he heaves and pants. And you want him to win. Divya Dutta and Pawan Malhotra add the much needed layers to Milkha Singh's personality than Milkha Singh himself. Their characters' aspirations and pride show through in the couple of emotional scenes between each one of them and Milkha Singh. Divya Dutta is easily one of the most under-rated actors in Hindi films. Jabtej Singh as young Milkha too gets you to feel his pain, despair and courage.On the other hand, Sonam Kapoor does her usual do as Neeru. She's stiff and looks like she's making a style statement with her salwar suits and hair curls. She has such little impact that you feel you have seen a lead lady in the film for the first time when Rebecca Breeds comes on screen as Stella.  Similarly, Prakash Raj as the comic relief didn't work for me either, as in he acted well, but the comedy seemed a little off for the film. If there is one thing you can tell about Indian men from what was going on, on screen and in the audience is that it takes as little as either a few bikini-clad or non-Indian women to excite them. Anyway, as discomforting as that was, from Neeru to Stella to Perizad (Meesha Shafi) they all exist to show Milkha Singh's priority - his work. The little time spent on Milkha Singh's transition from one woman to another tell's you about the makers' focus too - Milkha Singh and his training. I've always had a problem with the little time spent on the athlete's training in a sports film, or for that matter the minimal time that any underdog takes to come up to speed in a film. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is more than satisfying in that respect. Milkha Singh gets long and strenuous training sessions from the director,   enough for you to beg for his mercy on Milkha Singh's behalf. Another huge section of the film is the flashbacks into Milkha Singh's childhood and especially the partition of 1947. The sequences are a little too over-stylized for the era that they are set in. But, they are styled well. The editing, the transitions, the interspersing are all pretty slick and thus end up giving those bits a contemporary feel. Again, if that's what it takes to keep more people interested, so be it. The non-linear narration also keeps you absorbed.As you stay engaged, you realise that this is not about one athlete or one victim of the partition. Taking nothing away from how special Milkha Singh's achievements were to the country, especially in those times, almost any athlete will have stories of his roots and hardwork worth narrating. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is as much a salute to them as it is to the man himself. It is as much a tribute to the millions of partition victims who suffered and sustained as it is about how unfair his life was. You also wonder if the situation, especially of athletes, has really improved today. In fact, from the couple of cases I know, our non-star athletes have it worse now. The conditions they have to sustain in, the politics and corruption involved is mind-boggling. Subtly, the film also tells you how our soldiers, our protectors, have it worse than our athletes. It doesn't dwell too much on it, because the core of the film is Milkha Singh's spirit. I want my kids to watch Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, and I recommend you take yours too (Please read Parental Guidance section for details on Violent and Sexual content).  Not only for the film's potential to inspire, but also to sensitize them to parts of our history that are terrifying. Even more terrifying is that it is being forgotten and taken for granted. Kids know the partition, at best, as a story - India got freedom; India was divided; millions of people were displaced.  Bhaag Milkha Bhaag gives them a glimpse of what a kid their age went through. And of course, it's also important they see how he persevered through hardships that they cannot even imagine. It's our job then, to have them extrapolate it to the millions who suffered. So, this time around I'll take the little ones to the theater, not for the beauty of seeing life on screen, but for the beauty of a life or many. ]"
241,"[Michael Shannon is clearly a complex actor. Staid, stoic and with not exactly the widest range of expressions to offer, he was last seen as the superhero's archenemy in a recent summer blockbuster. Even there, his ice-cool, steely demeanour was what added an air of menace about him, never mind that the character itself had a moral ambiguity about it, which made it hard to hate or fear him outright.In fact, Ariel Vromen's The Iceman, a film that premiered internationally last year, probably found its release at this opportune time because of the worldwide visibility that Michael Shannon received courtesy Man of Steel. A dark, brooding character study of a contract killer who manages to keep that part of his identity a secret even from his immediate family, the film's measured pace, sombre atmosphere and Michael Shannon's turn as the real life Richard Kuklinski, on whom this film is based, are what hold the film together, despite its rather erratic writing and slight unwieldiness in directorial craft.Of course, what really intrigues you is Richard Kuklinski himself. It is hard to imagine a man who so easily takes up contract killing as a profession, who doesn't seem to have a moral compass that guides him with regard to the rights and wrongs of his actions. He is absolutely unflappable in the face of a crisis (as long it doesn't involve his family), and doesn't hesitate before taking a human life even if it isn't part of a contract.And yet, Richard Kuklinski was a living, breathing person; a man who took hundreds of lives and who seemed to show no remorse whatsoever. In that sense, The Iceman offers you no real graph. Despite the fact that the film gets its noir feel nearly right, it offers no real plot, no sense of anticipation in terms of a twist or two.A straight, bleak, stark narrative will always feel like a documentation of facts, as opposed to a real story with an emotional core that one can hang on to. The only times one can identify with Richard Kuklinski as a real human being is when he displays his love for his family, and even that is done with a sense of cold detachment. However, director Arial Vromen seems most out of sorts when he is trying to make this juxtaposition between the cold-blooded killer and the family man. This, precisely this, is where Michael Shannon's performance saves the film.The Iceman was an epithet given to Kuklinski himself, but it can very well apply to Shannon too. His physical appearance changes through the film, but the iciness remains the same. The expressions are minimal, but the emotions he manages to convey even without changing his expression is testament to what a unique actor he is - so much so that the man is literally a part of the mood that the film creates. One almost gets the feeling that just taking him out of the frame would brighten things up a bit. Ray Liotta plays Roy DeMeo, the mob boss who recruits Kuklinski and kickstarts his killing career. Liotta is in terrific form once again, maliciously towering over every other character in the film, even Kuklinski, when they share the frame. Chris Evans, in a completely different avatar as a grungy yet affable killer himself, is excellent in his tiny role. The weak link in the film in terms of choice of actor as well as performance is Winona Ryder, who plays Kuklinski's wife. Apart from the fact that she doesn't age one bit through the film, her performance comes across as false one time too many.Despite the interesting one-line premise The Iceman offers, as a film it doesn't particularly 'entertain' you, if that's what you're looking for. What it does rather well though, is manage to engage you by creating a dark little world, provided you are willing to submit yourself to it. The Iceman isn't for everyone; it is mostly for those who don't mind feeling a little cold deep, deep within. ]"
242,"[thehraav is the one word that kept coming to mind all through watching Lootera. Literally translated it means 'pause' or even 'permanence'. But a usage that applies better is when the word is used for notes to be held while singing. To keep the voice from cracking or going flat while holding a note, a singer needs control of breath and voice. This is the control you see in Lootera. And the moment you see yourself using a word applied to music, while watching a film, you know you are not watching just a film, it is poetry in motion. There are a few points which put you off what's going on but the beauty of the climax sets everything right.I haven't seen a climax as mesmerising as Lootera's. It's not a twist, it's not a revelation. In fact, it is predictable. It is just pure love. It is a shame then, that the makers felt the need to explain it in such detail with flashbacks and repetitions. And I am in love with the finish, despite this reservation.I am getting ahead of myself though. The first thing that should be told to people who want to know whether or not they should watch Lootera is that the film takes its slow pace very seriously. It is almost as if the makers want to push the envelope on how long a pause can be held, a scene can go on without background music, and so on. It does help that the film is set in the 50s.  The times when, most likely, people enjoyed their pauses. To top it off, you have a palace, the majesty of which is waning with the abolishment of the zamindari system. Amidst this is the daughter of a zamindar (Pakhi) who is falling in love with a guy who's job it is to take advantage of the zamindar's situation (Varun). There is something not so old school about the way Varun's (Ranveer Singh) relationship with Pakhi (Sonakshi Sinha) develops. Sure, there are distances and awkward exchange of glances but there is also boldness about Pakhi's demeanour that you do not associate with the 50s. Yet, this does not take away from your experience. And of course, references to films and songs from that era take you charmingly back to the ambiance of the film. Also, along with the 'paused' treatment, the film has a heavy grainy texture to add to the feel of that era - something reserved for flashbacks in films. You do feel like you are watching a two-hour long flashback, like someone has transported you to those times to narrate a story to you, that can be best enjoyed only if it is told only in that one tone. The camera complements this tone and moves like it is in love with its object. Be it Sonakshi or a street in Dalhousie or a barren tree. The performances then are like the last cog that need to fit in well, to make this clock work. While one can say that both Ranveer Singh and Sonakshi Sinha got by with just one or two expressions, it would be unfair to them both. With the limited range that the roles offer, you don't know what to make of their performances. And when you don't know if an actor acted well or not, it is safe to say they did a darn good job. After all, you are rooting for Varun even though he has wronged other people grossly. You don't think Pakhi is being stupid when she is falling in love, despite herself. You know her confidence, you know her insecurity. And her elegance shines through both. A couple scenes between them will stay with me for a long time. The dialogue is kept simple. No way does it want to interfere with the silences, neither do you want it to. There is a little bit of fun thrown in every once in a while but it always keeps with the spirit of the film. There are lapses in the way the story plays out and they are rather looming ones or rely heavily on coincidence. And yet, if you are in for a sweet-paced travel back to 60 years ago, you let go of those. If you want action and entertainment (in the funny fun sense of the word), you don't want to watch Lootera at all. It has no story, as such. Nothing is going to 'happen'. It is a simple love story. ]"
243,"[I guess the only actor left to play the badass, Robinhood-cum-Krishna cop was Sanjay Dutt. With Policegiri that's done and dusted too. That should answer all your questions about being loud, full of action, predictable, etc. There are tinges of surprise with the course Sanjay Dutt's character Rudra takes in the end. Also, some of the dialogue has spark while other lines are plain lame. However Prakash Raj, as the typical, villain politician Nagori, does his bit with such conviction that you can watch more of him even though it feels like you have seen him only in this avatar. His comic timing is impeccable and so is his dialogue delivery.On the other hand, for about the first half hour of the film, Sanjay Dutt sounds like he's talking while chewing on a betel nut or a paan. After that, you get used to it. The rest of his act is pure action do. In the same vein, Prachi Desai does what a woman in an action film is supposed to do - look pretty and give the hero's conscience a nudge if and when the need arises.There are bleak hints of wisdom when Nagori refers to how difficult it is for him to cater to his ego or irony when Sanjay Dutt questions how senior officers and politicians can support someone who has been booked under a terrorist act. More comedy than irony, actually.Considering Policegiri banks heavily on its action sequences, the action, related editing and post-production work on the action are all pretty awful. In competition for being awful are the song and dance routines, including the music.So, but for the saving grace in terms Prakash Raj's performance and a few lines, Policegiri has barely anything going for it.]"
244,"[The last time we met 'super-villain' Gru and his minions, they were planning to steal the moon, until Gru's paternal instincts act as a speed-breaker when three little orphan girls enter his life. Well, you can't make that up. Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin return with the sequel to their 2010 hit Despicable Me, and though Despicable Me 2 is quite some fun as well, what it really misses is the sheer audacity in plot, something that the first film thrived on.Gru has been settling in with his paternal duties nicely, until an organization named the Anti Villain League attempt to recruit him by sending his way one of their agents, Lucy Wilde. They want Gru to help them identify and nab a new super-villain. And what better way to catch one super-villain than pitting him against another, is their rationale. As with most animation films, Despicable Me 2 is fast-paced, superbly executed and yes, packed with laughs. The characters - Gru, Lucy and Gru's three girls Agnes, Edith and Margo - win your hearts. Combined with some intriguing shot design and the usual top-notch animation, the film makes sure you're watching it keenly right till the end. And of course, the highlight, once again, are Gru's minions; those adorable yellow creatures with a penchant for finding innovative ways to crash, bang and burn. Mostly voiced by the directors themselves, over the years they've become something of an internet phenomenon as well, and despite facing stiff competition from the characters mentioned earlier, they quite simply steal the film from under their noses.Where Despicable Me 2 falters is that it neither promises nor delivers a good enough payoff to take away from it - the film doesn't remain with you for very long after the lights come back on. The plot is too plain, too predictable and proceeds without too many twists to bother you along the way. Fun, yes, but Despicable Me 2 just doesn't have enough thrills to have you truly hooked.Steve Carell reprises his Gru, and is expectedly great with his zany accent. He manages to make the character his own so much that you can almost imagine Carell sitting somewhere with a hooked nose in front of a microphone. Kristen Wiig and Benjamin Bratt voice the two primary new characters that join the cast - Lucy Wilde and super-villain El Macho respectively, and they're fine as well, though I don't think they've added any extra spice to their characters by virtue of their voice. Miranda Cosgrove, Elsie Kate Fisher and Dana Gaier return as the little girls Margo, Agnes and Edith, and they are simply adorable. The film's 3D is nothing to boast of, so I'd recommend that if you were to watch the film, do so in 2D. Besides, the antics of the minions are best enjoyed without the burden of cumbersome glasses on your face. Despicable Me 2 will be best enjoyed by those who loved the first film, and those who love animation films in general. For most others, it will still make for a breezy, fun watch. With the minions' spinoff film that's been planned for 2014 - the promise of a film where the yellow fellows get a bulk of the screen time - this film serves a reminder of why that's something worth looking forward to.]"
245,"[The last thing you'd expect from a movie that had such an interesting trailer is that it wouldn't move ahead from there. You rejoice at 20 minutes when almost everything you knew about the story beforehand is covered and now there is two hours of fun to look forward to. And then nothing happens. If it weren't for some one-liners sprinkled through and a couple of decent performances, Ghanchakkar would've been a complete disappointment. The movie lingers too much. It stays with situations a little too long after the peak of the situation; the dialogue repeats itself a little more after it has made its impact; at many points the lines come a second or two too late. By then you are done and dusted with your prediction of what is going to happen and pretty much always you hit bull's eye. Including, the final twist. For the content it has, Ghanchakkar is a good 30-45 minutes too long.The only thing that keeps you going are a couple of the performances. Vidya Balan carries off her weight and ridiculous outfits with ease, as only she can. It is hilarious when her character, Neetu's sense of dressing is mocked at and she defends it with all pride. Even her weight is commented upon. However, her timing does go off in a couple of comic scenes and towards the end she is mostly shrieking. Her accent too inconsistent. Yet, every time she goes ""Hain?"" you just have to laugh. Namit Das as Idris has perfect timing for is one-liners. Unfortunately, he is handed some slapsticky sexual humor which doesn't quite work. Emraan Hashmi and Rajesh Sharma's roles don't need too much variation in their expressions and they stick to what is required of them. Also, the characters stay a good arm's distance away and you aren't really given a chance to get involved with the them.It gets insufferable after a while. There is only so much of Rajesh Sharma and Namit Das' shrugged-shoulder-laughter that you can find funny. There is only so much of - ""Where's the money?"" ""I don't remember. I've lost my memory."" ""Liar! I'll kill you/your wife."" - that you can take. The basic premise, where three guys loot a bank, and the one who is supposed to keep the money safe has supposedly lost his memory, is really interesting. But nothing is done with that.To spice it up they've added a few quirks like the goons using a local train compartment as rendezvous or a commuter carrying vegetables. But that's what they come across as - quirks that are forced in. They do not go with the flow of the film.  The Aamir-esque threatening caller on phone too doesn't add much fear. There was a possibility for a look into how the husband-wife relationship falls apart because of an illness and/or money, but that is dealt with rather superficially.This purported comic thriller never thrills and is funny only intermittently. Even if you don't compare it to the expectations that the promo material sets up, you'd end up disappointed with Ghanchakkar. ]"
246,"[Shortcut Romeo is desperate to be stylish, desperate to have a story, desperate to fill in all the elements considered to constitute a Hindi thriller - love, drama, action, betrayal. Only thing missing seems to comedy, thank goodness for some mercies. Yet, you have to give them some leeway for trying, even if they tried way too hard. You have a blackmailer (Neil Nitin Mukesh) taking advantage of having caught a rich woman (Ameesha Patel) red-handed. But this lady ain't going to take it lying down and gives him a good fight at being nasty. Interestingly, both supposedly have shades of good in them too. The schemes and counter-schemes they design are too elaborate and lie too obviously at the mercy of coincidences, which actually happen. Not to mention, they are a tad predictable too. The characters are either nasty or uninteresting for you to invest in them. That leaves the dialogue in the writing department to pull you in. Shortcut Romeo doesn't manage to take you in with any good lines either.The performances too are as dull as one would expect from Ameesha Patel or Neil Nitin Mukesh. However, the latter does try hard to infuse life into his lines and to bring out the mean streak in his character. Puja Gupta too tries her best to be sensuous and simple, but that ultimately amounts to a one-expression deal. The rest of the supporting cast is outright bad with their dialogue delivery and body language. Even so, it does feel like the makers give Shortcut Romeo its best shot. It doesn't feel like they take the audience for granted. Its just that the ability of the writer/director to engage us is limited. ]"
247,"[I am still processing the film. An hour after I left the cinema hall, and I am relishing the experience of not having understood the film completely. Oh, the lovely feeling of mulling over the lingering after-taste of a film. Despite a few issues with it - issues I'd have held a grudge against, if they were in another context. Context - that isRaanjhanaa's biggest strength. Not only that of Benares and its loafers who woo girls in two ways, or that of college politics, but also the differences between characters and how they play out because of those differences.  Of course, there's the music which adds a lovely texture to the milieu of Benares and Delhi. In fact, the first hour or so plays out like a musical. But its the other things that  are very unlike Hindi films that work forRaanjhanaa - like the two protagonists and a couple of the side characters are sketched out well, are intriguing and have lovely shades of gray.In fact, the main leads are as gray as a lead character gets in Hindi films. In the first few lines itself, Kundan (Dhanush) accepts our apprehensions about him from the trailers - that he is not ""good-looking"" - in a very matter-of-fact tone. From thinking of Kundan as a loser who is wooing a girl way out of his league - Zoya (Sonam Kapoor), you unknowingly start warming up to him. And even as you like him, you are not sure he deserves this woman who is smarter, better-looking, etc than him.On the other hand, you are not sure, Zoya is good for him either. She has her own thick shade of gray. Yet, Sonam Kapoor has a charming screen presence of her own to accept that there can be anything not-white about her. Yet she conveys ambiguity about her character's intentions throughout. That could be just because she pretty much maintains the same expression through the film. There are a few moments when you feel Zoya's pain and confusion, there are times when you want to scoff at her games, but we are soon back to the ambiguous expression. This time we can let it slide because it does seem intentional. There is something about this actor that makes you want to give her another chance. Dhanush on the other hand, comes across as the simple lad with simple intentions as his character Kundan. There are a few times he slips into a South Indian accent but that  bit is conveniently covered up by making him a South Indian Pandit in Benares. Yes, yes, I know there can be South Indian priests in  Benares, it is just a darn good coincidence. But, some how he intentionally converts you into liking his character even though you start out with a distinct dislike, and its not just because he is the underdog.Other than the broad stroke of true love and what one can allows oneself to go through when one believes they are in love, there are other underlying currents. Of course, there is the entire angle of political unrest and that of a dissatisfied section of youth trying to do what it can. That too is subtly put down with a neat little satirical scene. The one layer I particularly enjoyed is the irony of a boy stalking a girl all over town in the same film that has college students do street-plays about eve-teasing. The same girl who plays around with the sentiments of a boy who is in love with her participates in plays that talk about women being taken advantage of because they are women. These little things bring a smile.As do many of the quips. While some of these one-liners bring the house down with laughter there are others that sound cheesy and yet manage to make you smile. And then comes the last 15-20 minutes which leave you confused. The first two hours have done enough good to let this last bit cause too much damage. In fact, I enjoyed this air of mystery. Characters behave out-of-character and yet their actions don't take you completely by surprise. And I'm not complaining if they are creating space for a sequel, though I'd have apprehensions like I would of any sequel. Yet, you cannot shake off the feeling that it feels incomplete or even rushed. It did make me wonder more than once if the writers couldn't think of an appropriate and copped out by leaving it unsaid. That's Raanjhanaa for you, leaving you with a lot of mixed feelings, but in a good way. ]"
248,"[~ ~ ~ Update: DVD Review ~ ~ ~Such a pity that most home video manufacturers prefer to make single-disc DVDs today, packing the film as well the special features into one disc. Luckily, the Man of Steel DVD has no such shortcuts. Packed in a nicely designed outer jacket that has the same illustration as the DVD case, the Man of Steel DVD is a two-disc pack, with, obviously, the film on one disc and the special features on the other. The film itself is likely to have quite a few takers to have as a part of their DVD collection, but some excellent features on the second disc is what truly makes the Man of Steel DVD interesting. The first is an insightful 25-minute featurette titled 'Strong Characters, Legendary Roles' - which talks to the cast and crew about recreating some of the iconic characters from American - and indeed, world - pop culture for this film; how Superman, Lois Lane, General Zod and the likes have been reimagined, while still retaining the core of their characters.The second is also 25 minutes long, a featurette titled 'All-Out Action'. Man of Steel has some truly spectacular action scenes. This video goes behind the scenes, giving the audience a peek into what went into making the action of the film - right from the physical training the actors underwent, to designing all the green-screen action and stunt work. We get to hear from a number of the people who we otherwise never get to hear about. We thus appreciate the sheer magnitude into what it takes to achieve what we finally see on screen - these are the guys who truly create magic.After the first two, the third featurette is a rather tame 6-minuter titled 'Krypton Decoded', a video with the Visual Effects Supervisor of the film, who takes us through some of the technology that has been designed for Krypton in the film.Thankfully, the film itself also comes in multiple Indian languages - Hindi, Tamil &amp; Telugu - apart from English. Man of Steel was projected as an 'event' film, and the DVD of the film reflects the same; if you liked the film, then you'll love the DVD. ~ ~ ~ Original Review ~ ~ ~Delving far deeper (than previous screen adaptations) into the Superman origin mythology as well as the moral dilemma that an extraordinary being on a planet of ordinary mortals would face, Zack Snyder's Man of Steel, backed by the formidable writing team of David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, manage to camouflage their big Hollywood summer blockbuster quite well. More reminiscent of Nolan's now-legend superhero take - with it's nervous, edgy hand-held camera constantly on the move, attempting to infuse a certain grittiness into the moments where our hero has to struggle with the most basic problem of existence - choice - the film 'feels' different from just another gargantuan VFX vehicle.But, that is ultimately what it is.Relentless in its spectacular visual offering while never easing up on the fundamental conflict that young Clarke Kent faces before he ultimately rises to become the godlike protector of humanity, the core predicament that the film finds itself in is the fact that it attempts to pack in too much of too many good things. One grand, terrifically executed action set piece, followed by what will doubtlessly be termed a Nolan-esque peek into the world's most widely known superhero. Repeat; more times than you can count. By essentially following this structure (which, incidentally, is also non-linear, particular in the first hour), the film almost ends up becoming too much to take.The film opens on the planet Krypton, which is on the brink of self-implosion; scientist Jor-El chooses to save his newborn son by sending him to a distant foreign planet, with the larger aim of ensuring the continuance of his species as well. Infant Kal, son of Jor from the House of El, thus finds himself with the Kents in Smallville, Kansas. And thus begins a long search for meaning for Clark Kent - a search that sets him on collision course with General Zod, former military leader of Krypton, who is also tied intricately with Kal-El's past.Reminiscent, more than a few times, of The Matrix in terms of the superhero origin story (with Biblical references to boot, which I'd rather you discover for yourself, if you're inclined), the film also reminds you of Nolan's own Batman Begins in the manner in which Kal-El's search for meaning is treated. (Think images of a stubbled Bruce Wayne's tryst with street thugs before he crosses paths with Ra's Al Ghul.) Man of Steel, however, falters because it is just too big for its own good. Despite being overcooked, the film is undoubtedly an audio-visual treat. Hans Zimmer's score is moody, orchestral and grand; it goes great with the film. Few shoot action the way Zack Snyder does, and if you thought the action in 300 and Watchmen were shot well, wait till you watch Man of Steel. However, if the writing of the film appears weak because of the sheer number of big action scenes that it has, directorially Zack Snyder looks a little out of sorts when it comes to the more emotionally intimate scenes involving Clark/Kal-El and his parents, his birth father and Lois Lane. Henry Cavill grew on me through the film. Despite seeming like a fish out of water initially, in retrospect, perhaps that was just how young Clark felt while growing up amidst people who rejected him for being 'different'. By the end of the film, Cavill easily makes for the best Superman in recent times. He'll perhaps never match the popularity of Christopher Reeve, but this Superman is different anyway, and not just because he does away with the red underwear. Russel Crowe as Jor-El is terrific, despite having some truly incredulous lines to deliver. Michael Shannon as General Zod was a tad disappointing, but that was perhaps only because it is rare to have a villain with as much moral ambiguity as him. If you look at things from his point of view, you'll realize that one can easily justify his stance in the film. In such a scenario, the 'triumph of good over evil' remains questionable, and hence, unsatisfying. With a nearly 2.5 hour runtime, it boils down, then, to your expectations. Set them right and don't expect to be completely blown away with the film. You'll have a good time, that much Snyder &amp; Co guarantee. Expect the film to put The Dark Knight and The Avengers to shame, and the film is bound to fall way short.]"
249,"[You know what the word is about sequels? The one that they are worse than the first in the series. Well, we know what the verdict on Yamla Pagla Deewana was. All we can say is Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 stays true to the genre, ""sequels"".Okay maybe, the plot is a little more coherent that that of Yamla Pagla Deewana. But, that comparison is pretty much pointless considering Yamla Pagla Deewana didn't have a plot at all. The performances are the same brand of loud and over-the-top, good enough to once again make the actors look like fools prancing around. Once again, heart goes out for Anupam Kher and this time even Annu Kapoor who are reduced to doing such roles. Interestingly, Sunny Deol is the one who gives it his all and tries to pull the film along.As far as the action and comedy go, I have no clue who the action would excite and who would laugh at the jokes or get excited. There is always that element of laughing at, ""so silly that you cannot but laugh"" in films of this type. Fortunately or unfortunately, Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 has that element, but it wanes in about two and a half minutes. While watching the film, the only thing I was cringing at was the thought that there might be a Yamla Pagla Deewana 3. There is a Yamla Pagla Deewana 2, right? What is going to stop a third one from coming along? shudder]"
250,"[So that's how it feels. A screen playing a Marathi film packed to capacity, an audience hooting and cheering in the first show on the day of release. Twenty years after Tatya Vinchu terrified Lakshya (and the audience) with the sheer audacity of his existence, he's back, this time with the third dimension in tow. Despite being an unabashed fan of the original film, I reminded myself that I was only about 8 when I watched it first. I walked in to the theatre this time, with my palm at the ready, not too far from my face. Yes, I must confess, I was expecting to 'facepalm'.For the uninitiated, twenty years back, dreaded gangster Tatya Vinchu, in his quest for immortality, transferred his soul into a doll in his dying moments with the help of a spell taught to him by Baba Chamatkar. The doll, owned by ventriloquist Lakshmikant alias Lakshya, wreaks havoc before it is ultimately shot down by Inspector Mahesh Jadhav. Sounds ridiculous? Well, if you had watched the film when it came out, you'd know just how much fun the film was, despite the corn-and-cheese.Surprisingly, despite predictable buffoonery, continuous madcap comic horror (if there is such a thing) and the absence of the late Lakshmikant Berde - one half of the soul of the earlier film (pun unintended) - Zapatlela 2 makes for a fun children's film, especially if the audience were children when the original film came out. Yes, it is a silly film that rarely pretends to be anything but. However, sometimes, just sometimes, the hackneyed phrase, 'leave your brains at home', genuinely comes in handy.My palm and my face, then, rarely met during the film, and when they did, it was out of some genuine indulgent fun. This time round, Tatya Vinchu is hunting for Lakshmikant's son Aditya, who has grown up to become a mechanical engineer, but in his heart of hearts wants to be a ventriloquist like his father. Aditya, of course, is blissfully unaware of the events of twenty years ago. Really, I cannot emphasize how much your reaction to this film depends on whether you were a fan of the original film or not. That ragtag doll voiced by the legendary Dilip Prabhavalkar took on a personality of its own, engraving itself in memory. The doll looks freakishly the same, and that moronic expression on its face still has the ability to strike comedy-tinged terror in your heart.Zapatlela 2 works to an extent, in spite of having virtually no plot and a number of pointless subplots revolving around the ventriloquist, his guard, a lady journalist and a romantic track involving Aditya; it works because of its relentless physical comedy. Also, Adinath Kothare, son of director Mahesh Kothare, does a fine job as Aditya. Mahesh Kothare himself reprises his role as Mahesh Jadhav, now Commissioner, and he does it well. Again, the cherry-on-top is the menacing return of the doll, voiced by Dilip Prabhavalkar. He's still angry and bloodthirsty, and he's still capable of taking on full-grown men with ease. The doll animation is marginally better this time, but even if it wasn't, that would be the least of your concerns with this film. Also, I was quite surprised to notice that the makers haven't compromised on technique here. The film is fairly well-executed, in the manner in which it is shot and cut.And if you're going to enjoy ludicrousness, then you may as well enjoy the shameless exploitation of the third dimension. Objects are thrust and thrown at you with alarming frequency, and I could hear children in the cinema hall particularly enjoying the experience. Let's be clear; Zapatlela 2 is for fanboys and fangirls, and for their children, who are bound to have a good time. Take them along for a ride that Tatya Vinchu won't let them forget. If you don't fall in that category, then you've always got a palm and a face.]"
251,"[For aspiring filmmakers, particularly for those contemplating the 'independent cinema' route to fulfill their aspirations, Mere Haule Dost, directed by Nitin Raghunath, can either be an inspiring film, or an extremely depressing one, depending on how you look at it. Clearly, there is passion at play here. Also, very clearly, the team behind the film had to face a number of difficulties and constraints in the making of the film. But that's filmmaking; difficulties and problems are a given, particularly with low budget independent films. Most often, filmmakers set out, ready to face all the travail in the world, hoping that their passion for cinema comes up trumps at the end of the day. Sometimes, it does. Most often, though, you end up with something like Mere Haule Dost.Set in Hyderabad, Mere Haule Dost is about five zany friends (with nicknames like Bong, Bheja, Paisa and the likes) who are desperate to participate in a Himalayan bike rally. They set out trying to earn their way into it, encountering more than their fair share of problems along the way, relationships and love not being the least of them.On the surface of it, if you know what it takes to make a film, you want to like Mere Haule Dost, without even watching it. When you watch it, however, nearly every department of the film rankles because of how hugely flawed they are. One of them, quite obviously, is the production value. Making the most out of every rupee is an art, and not one that the people behind Mere Haule Dost seem particularly adept at. Somehow, though, supporters of indie cinema are conditioned to forgive this.The other is the technique - the cinematography and the editing. The latter, in particular, is shoddy enough for the film to be used as a case study in film schools - length and placement of shots is a major problem here, which ends up giving the film the feel of an amateur short film. The sound is another problem, though one can't expect much from this, when you consider that capturing clean sound on location is one of the hardest technical aspects of making a film.However, all of these could have been relegated to the background if the film had a rock-solid script at its core, and had likeable and competent actors enacting the key roles. It is these two aspects of the film that truly let it down, because they were easily the two aspects of the film that had the most potential.When making a coming-of-age, screwball youth comedy, you need the writing to be top-notch. You need to be able to buy the characters, their lines, their quirks and their shortcomings. You need crackling humour and you need the kind of spontaneity that you perhaps see in a sitcom. Sadly, you find none of that here. The long winded, pointless screenplay makes the film seem longer than it is. The narrative technique of cutting to a montage to explain a line or situation clearly doesn't work either. You also end up feeling bad for the cast, because they seem to be continuously struggling to not be the worst in the scene.If there is one thing I could take away from the film, it was the delightful Hyderabadi-accented Hindi, which has always been something I've loved. But that could be just me. Apart from that, the film doesn't even really manage to capture a flavour of Hyderabad, which could possibly have worked in the film's favour. Indie cinema needs to be encouraged, yes, and the fact that films like Mere Haule Dost even get a release is a huge step in that direction. For the immense effort that clearly went into the film, your heart goes out to the filmmakers. But as a film in itself, it is an ordeal that can easily be avoided.]"
252,"[*I am out on a vacation. Pradeep has been kind enough to review the film for wogma. So here goes...  ~ meetu* ----------------------------------------------In 2009, a young 26-year old's debut directorial film won hearts because of how fresh and real it seemed (by 'commercial film' standards, of course) especially considering that it came from Dharma, who've never truly been associated with anything 'real' as far as cinema is concerned. Wake Up Sid has since gone on to become a bit of a cult film; its male lead going on to achieve superstardom not just on the strength of his genes, but also because of some terrific performances that have only gotten better with every passing film.Naturally, expectations from Ayan Mukerji's sophomore effort, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, were bound to pile up. I, for one, corrected my expectations after the first promo was out. It seemed that Mukerji decided to forsake some of the freshness and realism from Wake Up Sid in favour of a bit more, if I may say it, 'masala'. That initial bit of correction helped me immensely, because my instinct about the film turned out to be quite close to how the film is.Stuck in limbo between the realism (or as much of it one can spike into a 'commercial' film) and the usual larger-than-life-ness one usually associates with Karan Johar (think Student Of The Year), Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (YJHD) is an easy, fun-enough watch for the most, largely due to its continuously vibrant feel, a highly competent lead and supporting cast, and its music, which straddles peppiness and flavor with ease. Episodic in nature, YJHD introduces us to Naina, a young medical student who is in a state of flux because she feels she just doesn't get to have enough fun. A chance encounter with an old school friend makes Naina cross paths with Kabir Thapar, or Bunny, as he is known by his friends. Despite being poles apart, their attraction to each other has ramifications in both their lives, not to mention the lives of their friends Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur) and Aditi (Kalki Koechlin). What surprised me about the film is how it is as much about friendships and relationships that go beyond romance, as it is about the romance between its (quite enchanting) lead pair. Quite like Wake Up Side which had the flavor of romance but was essentially a coming-of-age film, this film too has romance as one of its pillars, but not the only one. It also is a story of strong bonds of friendship that transcend time and space, about the compromises that one has to make in order to make any relationship work, romantic or otherwise. Not surprisingly, it is also, yet again, a coming-of-age tale, something that seems to be a pet subject for Ayan Mukerji. Expectedly, YJHD falters more than once. Every time the film pauses for a moment of genuine, real insight embellished by some cheesy-but-breezy dialogue (penned by Hussain Dalal), you see a spark of what was seen in Wake Up Side. Soon after, though, the film goes back to farfetched situations that would have seemed more at home in a typical film helmed by, say, Karan Johar. This continuous oscillation between the insightful and the 'filmy' takes its toll on the film more than one would have liked. Another area where the film really should have been worked on more was in the treatment of the characters. Despite wearing their chalk-and-cheese character sketches on their sleeves, Naina and Bunny in particular often act or react completely out of character. So, while their overall trajectory is always clear to you, their behaviour and traits will often make you wonder why exactly they are like that, when they are actually not supposed to be like that.Despite some rather serious issues in the writing, then, what really makes the film race to the finish line are the performances. Starting from Farookh Sheikh and Tanvi Azmi who barely have a couple of scenes, all the way up to Ranbir Kapoor who expectedly dominates proceedings in terms of screen time, every single actor is worth their weight in gold, as far as this particular film is concerned. The surprise packages are Kalki Koechlin, Aditya Roy Kapur and Deepika Padukone, who infuse such genuine charm, likeability, believability and credibility into their characters that you can't help but really love them. Ranbir's performance needs to be considered in context. After two diametrically opposite yet equally intense performances, one could be fooled into thinking that Ranbir could easily ace this character and that he deserves more challenging roles. Yes, YJHD doesn't challenge him like some of his earlier films, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't invest his all into it. Here is someone who gives every character everything he has, and Ranbir gives Bunny the life that he deserves. Also, one can't but help notice the terrific chemistry of the Ranbir - Deepika pair. They look like they are meant to be together on screen, and the optimist in me believes that they have the potential to become the SRK - Kajol of their generation.Despite some highly contrived song situations, the music of the film, by Pritam, holds its own. Every song is a bit of an audio-visual treat; even the one with Madhuri Dixit in it, despite the terribly underwhelming situation it arrives in. Overall, the songs do play a major role in keeping things going. Badtameez Dil and Balam Pichkari are terrific because of Ranbir and Deepika respectively, while Kabira and Ilahi add soul and texture to the soundtrack.With a run time of 2 hours and 45 minutes and the fact that the film doesn't really have anything new to say, the film isn't likely to be universally loved. Still, it is the kind of film you wouldn't attempt to find too much fault with, because of how it stays clear of getting annoying or overly predictable, even if you largely know which direction you are being led to. Not a particularly bad way to spend a few hours of your life, though I'd take Wake Up Sid over YJHD any day of the week, and twice on a Friday.]"
253,"[You meet someone. You become friends. You enjoy each other's company. You hate same things together. You fall in love. You begin to hate each other. Then, either you get back together or you don't. Ishkq in Paris is drabber in telling you this story than the way I've narrated it. Ishkq (Preity Zinta) - yes, that's the characters name! - and Akaash (Rhehan Malliek) go through the mechanics so clinically, that it feels all but real.And aren't love stories about making the unreal feel real. Just having a dialogue that says, ""This is a true love story."" doesn't make it one. Nor do lines like ""I love Bollywood."" and ""I love Paris"" make us believe that you do, they only make the words ""I love you"" sound like it was said because the writers couldn't think of other ways to express it. Preity Zinta and Rhehan Malliek do try their best to infuse life into the lines. But, that's the problem, their effort shows. That besides there is no relief from them. There are long scenes with them talking to each other. The only breather comes when Ishkq's mom Marie (Isabelle Adjani) is on screen, and then you wish you hadn't wished to see other faces. There are no 'aawww' moments, zero funny ones and lots of times when the film tries to be superficially cool with all its talk about ex-boyfriends and no marriages and so on. It does to try touch upon the deep insecurities of the lady protagonist, but turns into the age old, ""damsel in distress"" protocol. You really wonder what made Preity Zinta produce this one? Except for the line she says out loud in the film, ""So what, if we can't watch a film, no one can stop us from making one.""]"
254,"[As a skeleton, Aurangzeb comes across as Don with justification behind the sudden appearance of an underworld personality's look-alike. A look-alike who is willing to take the Don's place as a Police spy. But add on the flesh of complications and turbulences that the said justification brings along with it and you have an engaging, intriguing thriller. If only, it was a little less flat in its narration. It's been ages since I have seen a film that has worked so hard on a story; both in terms of the overall twists and turns and in bringing in the human factor to its relationships. That too on a theme as rundown as the underworld vs cops one. Of course, Aurangzeb is more than just that. It dwells on the themes of a father-son relationship from many angles. Interestingly, it doesn't dwell too much into the characters individually. Maybe that is why you don't get as involved as you could have been. Also later, the film does end up resorting to the most common thing that a gangster movie does to move the story ahead - kill someone. In that sense, one particular murder is more out of place and throws Aurangzeb into 'decent watch' categaory instead of 'must watch'. Otherwise, till this particular event, the film in fact, surprises you with its unpredictability. The change of hearts, for once, seem plausible. Motivations of the main players are clear enough for them to behave the way they do. And of course, the performances make all the events seem more believable than otherwise.Arjun Kapoor plays twin brothers, Ajay and Vishal well. He expresses the angst and turmoil well, however goes a little flat when he has to express the characters' softer side. Fortunately, Aurangzeb doesn't need him to show the mellow shades of characters for too long. You have an actor in a double role who does a good job and yet you have someone with a much smaller role outshine him. If you had to guess the name, Rishi Kapoor will be one of the people on that list. Even so, after Agneepath, this performance shouldn't surprise us at all. Prithviraj Sukumar remains his cool solemn-face self throughout and is teased by his screen wife about it too. Amruta Singh induces a slap-worthy performance which is good because her character invokes despise. Even with his two-minute role, Anupam Kher's face stayed back with me. Yet, I am glad they didn't add bits of his back-story just for the sake of it.Similarly, it is such a welcome relief to not see snazzy bits added in, just to make it 'commercially viable'. Whether in the name of item numbers or in terms of action sequences. Even if it means the narration feels drab as the movie progresses. Aurangzeb is one of those little surprises that makes you look forward to the director's next venture, even if you aren't completely satisfied with what was served this time. Just for the thought put in the story, just for making an otherwise done-to-death theme interesting, Aurangzeb is worth the watch. ]"
255,"[It seems all Hollywood has to offer us this week are adaptations of books. Mira Nair's screen adaptation of Pakistani author Mohsin Hamid's 2007 book 'The Reluctant Fundamentalist' appealed to me instantly because of the gritty, haunting atmosphere it creates right from the first frame of the film. However, it seldom manages to move you because of the broad, over-dramatic manner in which the story is treated. Mira Nair seems to have thrown everything she had at this film, but decided to leave subtlety in her back pocket.Set around a fictitious incident of international significance and traveling back-and-forth in time to reveal the journey of the protagonist, the film had all the potential to be a taut, gripping thriller which subtly puts forth the message that it holds - of how every man is responsible for his own choices and that in an ideal world, religion would have nothing to with it. However, it is the simplistic and loud treatment that lets the film down almost completely, despite having so much else going for it.The film is, at its heart, an intimate story of Changez Khan, a Pakistani lad who aspires for what most of his generation in this part of the world aspire for; success in the ultimate land of dreams and opportunity - the United States of America. Built around this central premise is a story of despair, injustice, fanaticism and ambiguous morality that is a repercussion of the most ingeniously horrifying terror attack in the history of mankind. The film tackles a theme that seems staple - how the life of a young Pakistani man, living the age-old 'American Dream', changes completely, post 9/11. It shows you what you've already seen or heard before - about how every person of South East Asian decent, specifically, every man with a Muslim surname or with a beard, was targeted and singled out for suspicion and eventual degradation and humiliation. Changez's journey starts off truly engaging you; a lot of this has to do with the performance of Riz Ahmed. The graph of his character, the slow build up of aspirations and love are wonderfully captured by his physicality as well as his eyes. Then, despite the eventual direction that his character takes being established too weakly, Ahmed holds fort and manages to carry you along with him. However, the film primarily fails in what sets this film apart from a regular emotional tale - the thriller format of the narrative. Then there is the black-and-white as opposed to the gray that a story like this should stand for. I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if the sharp lines with which characters and situations are etched are derived from the source itself. However, I couldn't help get the feeling that the book was essentially a film masquerading as a novel - the story and narrative technique appear to have such strong cinematic potential that a film adaptation was almost inevitable. Add to that the visual treatment that Nair gives to the film; I eventually lost count of how many times I told myself what a lost chance this film is.Riz Ahmed's performance is ably supported by the rest of the cast. Shabana Azmi and Om Puri, who play his Pakistani parents, are a joy despite their brief roles. Kiefer Sutherland as Changez's ice-cool, ambitious boss is perfect as well. Liev Schreiber who plays a journalist and one half of the conversation that is the core situation around which the film is set, does a fair job, but I often felt that he lacked the intensity that Riz Ahmed had. And how one wishes that the terrific Adil Hussain had more to do than just smile and mutter in a couple of scenes.The film also has a charming little Sufi-flavoured background score that has more than one good song. In fact, as I said earlier, the film had a lot going for it which makes it a fair technical achievement. It is in the overdone dramatics and thrill factor that the film really loses the plot. The Reluctant Fundamentalist is the kind of film I'd only recommend to those who feel satisfied by a film if even just a few aspects of it - the mood, visuals and Riz's performance in this case - work. Otherwise, it may be hard to find the film anything more than passable. ]"
256,"[With some of the most stunning visuals and gorgeously executed animation you'll see, you'd think that the makers of Epic would perhaps invest a tad bit more in the writing to ensure that the film becomes a memorable experience for the viewer. Sadly enough, that isn't the case. So, while you're always enjoying the animation part of the film, you're also always conscious of how the film isn't nearly exciting enough to be truly hooked by.Yet another film based on a book, this time on one titled 'The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs' by William Joyce, the film is a mixture of a coming-of-age tale, an underdog story, a fantasy adventure and even a tiny little teen romance. It recounts the adventures of Mary Katherine or MK, a teenage girl whose new life in the woods with her formerly estranged father takes a turn for the fantastic when she crosses paths with a group of miniscule warriors called the Leaf Men, who are locked in perpetual war with bug-creatures known as the Boggans.It becomes quite hard to be truly taken in by a film which you can predict almost every step of the way. MK's initial apprehensions of moving in with her father, how she encounters the Leaf Men, the path that the story then follows, almost all of it is something that even the least involved of audiences will be able to predict with ease. In fact, if the film wasn't embellished with the kind of top-notch animation that it is, it would have been downright boring. Even the humour in the film, something that is usually strong in most animations films, is largely insipid and uninspiring.The film, like a lot of other animation films, does have a message within as well. It talks about the universal conflict between 'them' and 'us', the divisions that cause a planet that deserves peace, to be in a constant state of flux. It also attempts to play on the age-old emotions of a young man or woman coming of age, rising to the challenge and eventually coming up trumps. Thus, because the film is at heart a clean, honest attempt at a fantasy adventure, it becomes very hard to dismiss it for the many flaws it has. The film also has an ensemble cast of voices for the characters, though I must confess that one big name in the cast quite disappointed me firstly in choice, and secondly in execution. Amanda Seyfried, who voices MK, does a fairly good job as the girl caught up in a war which she has to fight for her own good, even though it isn't hers to fight at all. She manages to evoke the right mix of hesitation and confidence through her journey in the film. Colin Farrell as Ronin, the leader of the Leaf Men is excellent as well. It took me a while to wrap my head around the idea that the mature and calming voice I was hearing was that of Farrell. The big disappointment for me was Christoph Waltz as Mandrake, the leader of the Boggans. Waltz's voice and accent just didn't suit the character in the first place. Yet, I expected him to lift it up by his sheer presence, which unfortunately just doesn't happen. None of the other voices are particularly memorable, save perhaps for Jason Sudeikis, who voices MK's father.From Blue Sky, the studio behind the Ice Age films and Rio, and directed by Chris Wedge, the man who directed the first Ice Age film, the animation is the one thing that makes Epic watchable despite the poor writing and mostly just-functional voice casting. The forest environment, the atmosphere created by the lighting, the execution of the action scenes, absolutely everything technical about the film is superb. Even the early part of the end credits is set in a beautiful little animation sequence that makes you stay till the end. However, the fact that they had all that effort put into the animation and so little into developing a funny and heartwarming story at the core of it broke my heart more than once. It isn't easy to tell someone that Epic is a film that can easily be missed; but that, unfortunately, is the sad truth of it.]"
257,"[~ ~ ~ Update ~ ~ ~I happened to catch The Great Gatsby on DVD and here's an update on the DVD features. It always feels nice when a DVD is packed with an extra touch here or there, to ensure that it feels like a collectible. Packed in an outer thin jacket with the same design as the DVD cover within, the DVD of The Great Gatsby also has an interesting special feature.There's nothing quite like listening to a director talk passionately about his own film. The bonus material in the DVD of The Great Gatsby is a 13-minute featurette that has director Baz Luhrmann talk about his choices and omissions regarding a few scenes that were deleted from the final film. What it did most for me was make me desperately want to revisit the film as well as the book - that's usually the sign of true love and understanding that a director has for his craft.The film itself, I thought, makes for a better DVD watch if you've already watched it on the big screen and were slightly disappointed by it. The 3D is gone, the Luhrmann-esque grandiosity assumes smaller dimensions on a smaller screen, and you can focus a wee bit more on the core of the film - Jay Gatsby and his love for the only true love of his life.Now if only studios and DVD manufacturers would specifically start designing DVDs keeping the Indian market in mind, vis-a-vis languages, subtitles and even packaging. Surely, we're a large enough market to deserve it!~ ~ ~ Original Review ~ ~ ~Grandiose, colourful, an orgy of vivid imagery and music, Baz Luhrmann's big screen adaptation of The Great Gatsby is often wondrous to look at, but lacks what it should have had the most - a gut-wrenching soul. That isn't to say that the film is unwatchable; but even as a cinematic work independent of the novel it is based on, the film shows far too much promise to be failing as much and as often as it does.The narrative voice-over must be one of the big dilemmas of cinema. Fundamentally uncinematic because of its very nature - if you are going to dictate something, then why have visuals at all - fact remains that some of the most enduring classics through the years have used voice-overs, and they've used them well. A quick skim through F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel 'The Great Gatsby', on which Baz Luhrmann's latest film is based, will tell you that considering the style of the book, the film would have to heavily rely on a voice-over to tell its tale.A part of me was secretly hoping that Luhrmann would be able to side-step this and bring what I consider an absolute epic - even though I read the book for the first time only a day before I watched the film - to life. Unfortunately, he does exactly what was expected; in fact, the opening lines of the film (voice-over, of course) have been taken from the book verbatim. By no means is the use of a voice-over the biggest problem with the film though.The film is narrated by Nick Carraway, a World War I veteran who is now back in New York, who recounts his experiences with one Mr. Gatsby, an enigmatic man who everyone seems to know of, but no one really knows. A film that is, at its heart, a story of enduring love and the sheer power that such love holds within itself, the competent ensemble cast keeps things at least marginally interesting all through the film. However, the film's big failure is that it just doesn't touch you, considering the emotional heft that the story in itself has.Luhrmann displays a remarkable command over the medium, playing with it visually as well as aurally, succeeding in developing a fairly interesting narrative method. He also recreates not just the period that the film is set in, but the environment and feel that of the novel as well. The film also has a terrific soundtrack, one that focuses more on the mood and the emotions than on any sort of faithfulness to the era in which it is set.However, while the 3D of the film isn't visually poor as is usually the case, I fail to see the point of shooting this film in 3D. If anything, this film is hampered by the 3D more than most other films, because the glasses almost act like a barrier between the audience and the characters. At the heart of the epic-like exterior lies a core of pure love, one that deserved to be laid out for the audience without having additional encumbrances as distractions. The 3D is a poor technical choice (quite understandable though, considering Luhrmann's background in theatre and the larger-than-life manner in which he usually treats his films.)As I said earlier, the one thing that kept me continuously interested in the film were the performances; while Tobey Maguire as the narrator Nick Carraway is functional - he seems to be getting distinctly repetitive in his expressions, delivery and posture lately - the supporting cast comprising of Joel Edgerton and Carrey Mulligan, who play the husband-wife pair of Tom and Daisy Mulligan, are terrific, as is Jason Clarke in a tiny little role. Edgerton, in particular, is such a fine actor that it seems like a terrible waste that he doesn't have more films written specifically for him. Amitabh Bachchan's appearance is expectedly brief, and watching him on the big screen with another of my favourite actors - who I will come to in a bit - was a joy. Not surprisingly, he has a strange accent as well, but between his delivery and his baritone, it doesn't really jar.Leonardo DiCaprio simply aces it as the enigmatic Jay Gatsby. Not nearly as good as some of his other performances (his most recent turn as Calvin Candie in Django Unchained, for example), he still pulls it off with such ease and conviction that he almost single-handedly manages to infuse some of the lost emotion into the film - not nearly enough to achieve what the story and novel deserved, but his performance works nonetheless. Also, a special mention must go to Callan McAuliffe who plays a teenaged Jay Gatsby. Though his role is brief, he is uncannily convincing as a young Leo. I expect most people to be underwhelmed by the film, while some will probably find it downright boring. However, I do expect those who've read the novel to be intrigued by the film at various points during the runtime. There are portions where Luhrmann displays snatches of brilliance in the text-to-screen adaptation of the material, while largely he seems to have missed a trick or two when it comes to capturing the soul of the text. And yes, my conscience won't permit me to end this without strongly recommending F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel to anyone who is in love with the written word!]"
258,"[Gippi or Gurpreet Kaur needs to be comfortable with who she is. But, for that one should know what one is, right? Gippi, the film, concerns itself with the struggles of the ordinary teen - the one who is just about average or even below average at academics, sports, popularity and so on. But this teenager could easily be any common person, and the school setting changes to the work or even family environment. Sure, Gippi is over-simplified, but the cute factor makes up for it. Set in Shimla, the film has a cozy, warm feel to it. To top it off, you have a chubby, cute character trying to make her place in the world or at least be okay with whatever place she has. You have additional layers of first love, sexuality, teenagers trying to cope with the changes in their bodies. The curiosity, the giggles make the characters and thus the film relatable. However, the nastiness that these kids pelt each other with seemed a little over-done, but then maybe that's how life for kids these days is. Also, for all the ""fun"" Gippi is made to say she is, the film would have been served better if there were some exposition to her fun side. Instead, we see a grumpy adolescent who is treated badly because she is fat. She is also called ugly, but that didn't come across either. Riya Vij is too cute to be called ugly, even in fiction.Yet, its her performance that keeps you hooked through. Her innocence reaches out to you. She uses her eyes very well to convey that her genuine personality. If only, she didn't have that slight delay in her dialogue delivery that puts the timing of a dialogue off. In fact, that is the problem with the entire cast, except maybe for Divya Dutta. Since the entire cast has its timing off by that fraction of a second, I guess it is the director's doing.Despite these lapses, the world of Gippi is worth a peek into. If for nothing else, just to remind you of small moments from your childhood, moments we have long forgotten. ]"
259,"[The most annoying bit about zombie films is that the story just doesn't move, only the zombies do. It starts with people becoming zombies, one inexplicable way or the other. It goes on with deadpan, gory zombies staggering around beautiful scenery. Living people fight dead people in an hour+ long chase sequence. And people beat the zombies in the last 15-20 minutes. That and you have people eating people. Go Goa Goneis more or less the same, except that it has a lot of fun along the way and is headed towards a definite purpose. Go Goa Gonestarts off with the usual toilet and sexual humor you'd find in a film involving three bachelors living together, down to the oft-repeated Hardik joke. But, it has its unique style which keeps you interested. And of course, you are waiting for the zombies to appear. Meanwhile, beyond the commonplace humor are one-liners that make you  laugh out loud. With context, even the 'globalization' dialogue, that put me off in the trailers, works. The dialogue is witty and yet, not filmy. It is the kind of language friends would speak with each other. The delivery of course, is perfectly timed, else the lines would have fallen flat. Kunal Khemu, Vir Das and Anand Tiwari carry out the buffoonery well. Puja Gupta's Luna exists just so the film doesn't become too 'man'ly. But she does well nevertheless. Saif Ali Khan has his usual screen presence, but isn't required to do much really. In fact, this film is not about the characters at all. The main leads start out as the typical good, bad and in-between trio. The distinguishing lines soon merge into all three of them being afraid while keeping their humor intact. Yet, except for a couple of times, it doesn't seem out of place. I'd think zombie films would be categorized as horror films, but Go Goa Gonedoesn't fall in the horror category. Sure, it has more than its share of gore and intestine like things being pulled out of necks but it still doesn't qualify as horror. Also, the background score is quite different from the kind we associate with horror films or even thrillers. In fact, Go Goa Gonegoes beyond these genres to even comment about things like group dynamics in terms of who become a leader and how a group goes astray without a leader. You have an additional layer of a 'social message' stuck on to it. While, I'm not too much in favor of adding meaning to a film by merely slapping on a message at the end, I'm glad Go Goa Gonehad one. At least there is more to a zombie film than people walking around like zombies. Also, the manner in which the message unfolds makes it pallatable, except for the last revision of lessons and ""moral of the story"" dialogue between the characters. Similarly, there are a couple of instances in which the people behave dumber than the zombies. Clearly, the situations have been added just to bring in some variety in an otherwise flat plot. But, they are all done in good humor and hence pass by. What makes Go Goa Gonea film worth the watch is certainly the fine manner in which comedy and horror/thriller have been combined. Who would have thought a day would come when I'd say, I'm looking forward to the sequel of a zombie film!]"
260,"[If you're a sci-fi fanboy, you almost definitely know who J. J. Abrams is. And depending on where you fall in the spectrum between optimism and cynicism, you either hate him or love him already. With the keys to both Star Trek as well as Star Wars, Abrams definitely had a lot to stand up to. Well, with Star Trek Into Darkness, Abrams is already on strike one, at least in my book. Taking off from the 2009 Star Trek, which had a convenient changes in the series time-line to enable modification of certain elements, Into Darkness is mostly an insipid, long-winded and often pointless film, perhaps the only highlight being a certain Mr. Benedict who seems quite adept at, shall I say, Batch-slapping humans and Klingons alike. When a mysterious man carries out an attack on Starfleet headquarters and disappears into space, Captain James T. Kirk, Spock, and the rest of the crew are sent off on a mission to take him out. The mystery behind their new foe, however, deepens as Kirk and his crew are sucked further into a series of events they don't understand.While the film never transgresses into unwatchable territory because of some of the cast, the action scenes and a number of inside jokes and references, (some of which I'm sure I missed because I'm more of a Star Wars fanboy myself,) the film has long stretches where it pretends to be a bit of a human drama about friendship and morals. That isn't a bad thing by itself, but it tends to weigh this film down, because neither does it play the role of raising the tension and the stakes, nor does it particularly touch your heart. Bringing nothing new to the table in terms of plot or execution, the film continuously gives you a feeling of been-there-seen-that, which is so ironical considering the most recognizable line from the franchise is 'boldly going where no man has gone before'. Even the so-called mystery in the plot is mostly predictable even if you have the bare minimum of knowledge about the series and haven't read up much on this particular film.Not surprisingly, the main reason people were looking forward to this film - the mouth-watering prospect of Benedict Cumberbatch as villain - is the only thing that remains continuously interesting in the film. He has a searing, enigmatic, fierce presence which largely manages to live up to the expectations people had from him. Unfortunately, his presence in terms of screen time is far lesser than one would have hoped. Chris Pine as Kirk is the same, although he does seem to have grown into the role of Captain far more. Zachary Quinto as Spock is exactly how he was the last time around. Karl Urban, split between his two Star Trek appearances as McCoy and his deadpan turn as Judge Dredd last year, seems to have found some renewed vigour this time round.Abrams disappoints; there's no two ways about that. Be it his control over craft or the narrative, he has quite clearly lost the plot. So much so that even great CG and decent 3D post-conversion doesn't help the film rise above its heavily flawed and uninteresting screenplay. His usual love for lens flares, optical or digital, makes for a film that definitely looks good. But not good enough to justify spending all that time twiddling your thumbs, waiting for something to happen. J. J. Abrams has painted a big red target onto himself, and come 2015 when Star Wars Episode VII hits the silver screen, nearly every pair of eyes in the universe will be on him. And something tells me that no galaxy, however far away, will be safe for him if he messes up again! ]"
261,"[I have noticed, these days, when the decibel level of a film goes beyond a certain level, I tune off. There you go, that's my disclaimer. I tune off so well, that I have to resist myself from a quick nap. Despite this, Shootout at Wadala managed to give me a headache by the end of the film. Or maybe it was because of my attempt at controlling my sleep. Eitherway, Shootout at Wadala is your regular gangwar film where everyone wants to kill everyone else. There is one slight difference in that it tries to talk about the ineptness of the system that creates gangsters out of good people. But the message is too little compared to what you have to sit through in terms of pure noise. Not that it is something very new, in any case.The actors do infuse life into the story that runs on for too long. But, the problem with a film that is so intense in terms of how quickly all the characters get angry, doesn't require too much variety from the actors. But, within what is required of them, they do well. Not that there aren't light moments in the film, but they cater to the kind of people who find a good laugh in abusive language just because it is abusive. The rest of the dialogue is way to filmy with all the mythological, religious and philosophical references. The romantic track, though important to the film is given too much of a step-sisterly treatment.In fact, it looks like more time and energy has been spent on 'item numbers' who appear abrupt despite the fact that they are immediately followed by a horny Manya Surve (John Abraham) at Vidya's (Kangna Ranaut) door. Even so, given my aversion to gore and action for the sake of it, if you do enjoy such fight sequences, you might find Shootout at Wadala worth a watch. Like Shootout at Lokhandwala, this one too has its share of creatively killing people. Ultimately, Shootout at Wadala seems to be the kind of film that will be enjoyed by people who like this mix of moderately gory action, toilet humor and aggressive romance. ]"
262,"[Could there be a better way to pay tribute to something, than making a contribution to it? Better yet, when the makers' passion for the medium shows in the work. So, then do we show our love for the director who went  out of his comfort zone? Or for the one who did what he always does best - engage us by adding quirk to the simplest of stories? Or for the two in between - he who tells the story of a compassionate father or her who makes a son shine despite his father? Or should we talk about the discontent at what was missing or overdone? Karan Johar steps out of his glamorous shoes which must have been quite difficult. To not resort to lip-sync song and out-of-place dance must have been an effort in itself - even though there was a perfect enough excuse for one, two characters (Rani Mukerji and Saqib Saleem) working on Bollywood gossip. In fact, in contrast to the other three films, the only form in which this short film refers to Bollywood is through songs from yesteryears and dialogue. To top it off, looks like he wasn't allowed to take a trip to snow-capped Europe, much to our relief. (Boy, must that have been a toughie for Karan Johar!) Yet, his is the most chic story in terms of ambiance as he gets to play around with the relatively upper class parts of Bombay. That's as glossy as it gets. Though Karan Johar's quarter of Bombay Talkies seems like the most personal of the short films, it was over-eager. His account of a homosexual man who meets a woman he hits it off with, felt like a story he was dying to tell. That he had this passion to desensitize the Indian audience to this taboo film is great. But, that it came on so hard - not so great. Unfortunately, once again, Johar's approach to the gay world brought out sniggers and worse, 'eeewwws' and 'yucks'.Once done with the weakest of the films in terms of stories, we have Dibaker Banerjee's film about a struggler (Nawazzudin Siddiqui) who takes pride in all his struggles. Till he is shown his shortcomings by his own hallucination. This part of the movie was more about two sequences in the film rather than the film itself. One, with a surreal setting in which the lead character is forced to face reality. And the other is a lovely tribute to silent cinema. Of course, there are many other smaller things which you will discover and there are others which don't connect, but these bits stay with you.Bombay Talkies love for cinema deepens with Zoya Akhtar's Naman, a child stifled by the ambitions of his father. Like many people I know in real life, Naman made lonely and ignored by his parents takes refuge with Bollywood. The God-like stature he assigns to his favorite star is the logical next step. Zoya's gently slaps us as a society, twice. Once with her comment on parents who not only force their ambitions on their children but also corner the kids into lying to them. Then, with us as a society which produces and goes on to popularize songs that shouldn't be heard or seen by kids under ten. It is amazing how we clap while our children dance to these numbers. Her soft and indirect touch to a controversial topic like transvestites too, is pretty brave.And the best is saved for the last. You can trust Anurag Kashyap to combine two disparate topics with finesse - our fanaticism as fans of stars and our unquestioning regard for our parents wishes. He celebrates and taunts both these aspects at one go. Yet, this is the simplest story of them all. Even though it feels a tad too long, the pace and build-up to the climax is beautiful. Vineet Kumar Singh as Vijay looks like another of Kashyap's finds that we ought to watch out for.  His desperation and persistence alone makes this section worth the watch. And of course, you have more bonuses along the way. All this builds up to the promotional song which I hated the first time I saw it on YouTube. But, with the flow of the film it had a completely different feel to it. Also, the version I saw earlier didn't have the complete version, it left out the charming old times. Yet, it deserved better than the green-screen patch job it got for the last bit. And the signature tune assigned for the current generation of actors still didn't work. So, while Karan Johar's story on a man's struggle with his sexuality might be the most impressive in terms of how far he's come out of his box, and Dibaker Banerjee &amp; Zoya Akhtar's stories warm you nicely as tributes to our love for cinema, Anurag Kashyap's bitter-sweet reference to our reverence for stars is easily the one I'd like to watch again. Now, it's difficult to put my favoritism for the director aside when asked to compare. But, then again, given the context, this once I'm allowed that. ;)]"
263,"[Perhaps the biggest tragedy of the film viewing culture in India is how disinterested most of us are in documentaries. Most people equate documentaries with a yawn, perhaps. But if ever someone who loves cinema but doesn't like documentaries needed an example of how gripping, emotional and narratively-strong a documentary can be, without venturing too far from their comfort zone, the film to show them would be Shivendra Singh Dungarpur's acclaimed documentary Celluloid Man.The film is a deeply personal and nostalgic take on the life of P. K. Nair, the man almost wholly responsible for what is now known as the National Film Archives of India (NFAI), in Pune. And through the journey of the film, we also understand what true passion for cinema is; how someone can be so devoted to collecting and archiving films for posterity, because he understands what very few people do - that perhaps films offer the most comprehensive and indicative representation of the times, even if most of the films he collected and archived were 'fiction'. Shot by some of the foremost cinematographers in India - names like Santosh Thundiyil, K. U. Mohanan, Mahesh Aney, Vikas Sivaraman, Kiran Deohans and the likes - the film also looks at Mr. Nair's life through the eyes of the some of the most respected names in Indian cinema; a number of them being former students of Mr. Nair from the Film &amp; Television Institute of India. Through rich anecdotes and little stories that highlight the man's tireless work and the result of it - prints of tens of thousands of film from across the world stored, the work of great masters worth many times their weight in gold - the film is a heartfelt ride that is inspiring and humbling at the same time.Clocking in at a two and a half hours, the film still felt too short, for me; so beautifully engaging was the story of the man who, I must shamefully admit, I didn't know of before I heard about this film in late 2012. While primarily being about the life of P. K. Nair, through his journey, the film also touches upon so many little-known facts of India's film history and the people behind it. Just the mere names of some of the legends mentioned - Ritwik Ghatak, for example - gave me goosebumps. Then, to hear of how highly these stalwarts of Indian cinema regarded Mr. Nair, aptly sums up his immeasurable contribution to the documentation of the history of Indian cinema. The painstaking manner in which he went about acquiring and restoring prints, the way in which he encouraged his students to view cinema the way it must be viewed, the little joys he experienced when acquiring a particular print brought with it it's own little highs and lows - we live all of this and so much more through the film.If there were any problems I found, they were more with directorial choices than anything else. So, one can disagree with them, but one can't fault with them. They were, after all, choices made by the director, ones that he was completely entitled to. For example, the manner in which certain scenes involving Mr. Nair were 'staged' for the documentary; they were quite obviously shot for visual appeal and to propel the story forward, even though they aren't a part of Mr. Nair's routine. Or even those interludes with the director's own voiceover used to bring certain information to the fore. As I said, I can only disagree with them in their usage, but they can't really be faulted. Then, above all, the film is remarkable because it doesn't just show you the importance of archiving cinema, but the importance of preserving memories of life, the importance of being passionate about what you do, the importance of understanding that your life will only be worthwhile if you do your best to ensure that it means something. Celluloid Man will move you, and will reinforce the fact that cinema is life. ]"
264,"[~ ~ ~ Update ~ ~ ~I happened to catch Iron Man 3 on DVD and here's an update on the DVD features.You'd think that the best thing about the DVD of a movie that's as fun as Iron Man 3 would be the film itself. Well, if you did think that, you'd be forgiven for being a little wrong.An 8-minute bonus featurette titled 'Deconstructing the Scene: Attack on Air Force One' shows the making of one of the most thrilling set pieces from the film, and believe you me, the making of that scene will blow you away even more than the scene itself. A true victory of production and VFX, it reminds you just why movies can be so magical. How one wishes though, that Shane Black had made a consequential appearance in this featurette, to provide some more insights on how the director sees such a scene.The DVD also has another interesting bonus feature - a minute-and-a-half behind the scenes sneak peak at Thor: The Dark World, which releases in November 2013. The clip does make you look forward to it.Then there's the film itself, which makes for as fun a DVD watch as it was on the big screen. As is the norm these days, all of it is packed into a single disc; one that sadly has no subtitles or language options in any regional Indian language.One small touch that Iron Man fans might enjoy is the fact that the DVD Menu loads with an intro by Jarvis, Iron Man's AI sidekick (for want of another word.)~ ~ ~ Original Review ~ ~ ~ In that epic climactic conversation scene in Kill Bill Volume 2, one of Quentin Tarantino's masterstrokes was Bill explaining the Superman mythology to The Bride; he says that, unlike other superheroes who wear a costume and become 'super', Superman is exactly who he is. Superman. Clark Kent is the disguise; that's his costume. While what Tarantino said about Superman makes perfect sense, when it comes to what he said about the other superheroes, I will, for once, differ with the man. We are all are known by the choices we make; all the superheroes we love, be it from the Marvel universe or the DC universe, discovered immense power that they chose to channel in a heroic manner. And the moment they made that choice, they became the superhero. So, what is true about Superman, is actually true about the others as well. It is, quite simply, the fundamental truth that lies at the core of every superhero story. Batman is always Batman; Bruce Wayne is the costume. No superhero film, for me, has explored this fundamental facet of the superhero mythology quite like Iron Man 3 does. There may be many Iron Man suits, which anyone can wear, but there is only one Iron Man. The film also carries the message that the biggest bit of heroism is perhaps defeating the demons within. But, to heck with messages really. Iron Man 3 is, above all, smashing good fun.The story of Iron Man 3 is set post the events that occurred in The Avengers, which was released exactly this time last year. Iron Man, if you remember, passed through a portal into another dimension and back before crashing to the ground in a freefall. Since then, Tony Stark hasn't been the same. This time around, he also has to contend with an obscure, secretive villain known only as The Mandarin, who is responsible for a series of mysterious bomb blasts around the globe.The film does have a bit of a slow build up, but once it gets full throttle, it can only be described as an audio-visual spectacle. Thrilling action set pieces, peppered with Tony Stark's acerbic wit all through, along with a number of superb supporting performances make the film a rollicking ride alright. It still isn't nearly as much fun as The Avengers, but it is quite easily the best Iron Man film so far.Big credit for that must definitely go to Shane Black, who directs the franchise for the first time, after Jon Favreau directed the first two installments. In fact, this is Shane Black's first feature since the insanely clever Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (also starring Robert Downey Jr) way back in 2005, and only his second feature film as director. Huge jump in terms of scale, especially considering the eight year gap, but Black does full justice to it. The Iron Man - Tony Stark relationship feels so much more intense, and yet so much more comfortable, I suspect, due to the touch brought in by Black. But then. Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark. Who is Iron Man. You can't say either Tony Stark or Iron Man without picturing Robert Downey Jr as the man who is the face and the voice of the character. His electric presence, his spontaneity and the sheer physical character makes Iron Man the thrilling cinematic superhero that he is. Never have egotism and self-aggrandizing humour looked so good on screen. Robert Downey Jr is one of the finest mainstream male lead actors in the world, and watching him is always a joy. Shockingly enough, it is possible for someone to steal scenes even from under Robert Downey Jr's nose. And, to do that, who better than Sir Ben Kingsley? Though he has very little screen time, this is the kind of character and performance that an actor should die for. The Mandarin becomes one of the most enigmatic and memorable villains ever because of what perhaps no other actor could bring to the table; you see, acting twice is harder than acting once. (That's me trying to be as enigmatic as The Mandarin. Wink.) Guy Pearce, who also joins the franchise for the first time as Aldrich Killian, the super-scientist with a secret, is superb as well. So are franchise regulars Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow as Col James Rhodes and Pepper Potts, respectively.I watched the film in IMAX 3D, which no doubt added to the experience of watching some of the best-executed action scenes you'll see. Otherwise, I don't think watching it in 3D is mandatory; I'm sure the film will be good fun in 2D as well. For some phenomenal acting, great action and for those goosebumps you'll undoubtedly get every single time Tony Stark becomes Iron Man, the film is a must watch. Submit yourself to Tony Stark's world; you'll have a good time, I promise.PS - Stay right until the end of the final credit roll for a fun little Easter Egg!]"
265,"[Love... sigh... Haven't we all done something purely crazy because we believed that is what love is? And hasn't it been ages since we've seen moments of genuine selfless love on screen. It has been longer than that since I saw characters, in Hindi films especially, introspecting and knowing what the other person feels without being told. Aashiqui 2 is the film that has brought these things alive on screen. Yet, it  doesn't fill the gap for a love story that sucks you in completely with its romance.Once the characters Rahul Jaykar or RJ (Aditya Roy Kapoor) and Aarohi (Shraddha Kapoor) were established, it kept nagging me that I couldn't feel with the characters. Fine, the broad stroke of the story is predictable. But, every once in a while, there is a dialogue or a moment of introspection that makes you regard the character in new light. Here are lovers who take their time to fall in love and express it. Sure, there's the slow pace that can be blamed for making you wait for what happens next. But hey, if you are waiting for what happens next, the film is working just fine. After all here are two lovers, both singers of star status, one sticking on to the other when the going gets bad. Isn't that what we want our loved one to do for us? Isn't that what we'd do for our beloved?And there came the realisation! I know Aarohi and RJ are in love with each other. But, I know it because of what the characters do for each other or say to each other. It's not because I am with them in this journey of theirs. That emotional connect is missing. Interestingly enough, the actors cannot be entirely put to fault for this. Shraddha Kapoor's innocent face does half the work for her. I wouldn't take away from what she contributes as an actor here, but she has a charming screen presence. She brings through Aarohi's simple-mindedness and commitment with poise. Aditya Roy Kapur does his good-at-heart RJ genuinely. Despite your cynicism, you believe how selfless he is. On the darker side, you also don't question why he has set himself on a path of self-destruction. The bits, and these are big bits, where he falters are those where he tries to convince us he's drunk. And that's a huge let down. Shouldn't 'acting  drunk' be the primary qualification for an actor to be able to claim himself as one? Very rarely, do I feel like adding a separate comment about the director. I believe that everything that happens in the film is the director's doing. So, how I feel about every department of film-making is indirectly a comment on his work. Some of the tiny choices made here though, added to my experience. The casual way in which funny lines pass through without drawing extra attention to themselves, the control over drama when we are ready for melodrama - to name a few. Yep, these should be the norm by now. But, till it doesn't, it deserves extra mention if not points. The other departments too add to the ambience too. While the crisp camera-work lends a fresh feel to the film, the music kept me going with the flow of the film. I'm not sure if I would enjoy just listening to the songs. But, they worked really well within the context of the film. The film itself has a lovely flow (except for the abrupt last 10 minutes) despite being 15-20 minutes longer than I would have liked it. I must say I was surprised that I liked the film as much as I did. When I saw Aashiqui as a teenager, I remember thinking why do all love stories end up with either ""happily ever after"" or ""both die"". Aashiqui 2, with a few light moments in the beginning, a little drama and loads of non-eewww romance, holds your attention and keeps it there. It just doesn't reach out to your heart, wholeheartedly. ]"
266,"[Based on a novel by the same name by Anita Nair, Lessons in Forgetting, directed by Unni Vijayan, speaks about so many issues, big and small, but all pertinent and relevant, that it at once becomes an important film that must be watched, as well as a film that doesn't make for an easy watch at all. The film gnaws away at what we know and think we know about relationships, people and society, through the journey that the characters in the film undertake, as they deal with loss. Set primarily in Bangalore and in a tiny coastal town in Tamil Nadu, the film also has a perceptible flavour of the setting, which makes it seem far more 'real' than most films we've seen lately. J. A. Krishnamurthy is an NRI who is back in India, because his daughter Smriti has suffered a severe, near-fatal accident. As he digs into the cause behind the accident, trying to get to the root of it, he also discovers that he knew his daughter far lesser than he'd ever imagined. Meanwhile, Meera is a middle-aged mother of two whose husband walks out on her without the slightest of warnings. As she deals with this, Meera and Krishnamurthy's paths cross. Fashioned as a mystery that is in reality a human drama, a commentary on relationships and societal stereotypes, the film is rendered most relevant by the fact that it takes a long, hard look at the manner in which Indian women are seen in society today, and about another, far more gruesome and worrying truth of gender politics in India - the fact that to this very day in the 21st century, the interiors of India are still opposed to the birth of a girl child.But that is in rural India; we all know about that don't we? All of us engage in social media outrage against the lack of education amongst the 'other' India about gender equality. How about in urban India, then? A man walks out on a marriage, but even the teenaged daughter holds the mother responsible for it, without a second's thought. An outspoken, friendly, educated girl wants to wear a tank top because it is hot, and by nature she's friendly with every guy she meets, but that automatically makes her an object that the men want to 'own'. ""She's my girl,"" exclaims one of her over-enthusiastic male friends, without ever bothering to find out if she feels the same way. The film offers no solutions; but then why should it? I've gone hoarse saying that cinema mirrors society, not the other way round, no matter how much people blame the portrayal of women on screen to be the reason behind men objectifying women in real life. The malaise is deep-rooted in our society, right from the time the girl is born. Before we begin eradicating the problem, we must recognize it. That, precisely, is what the film offers us; it holds up a mirror and reminds us that we need to change from within. In fact, there are portions in the film that will make your blood boil, as we see the just how spineless yet savage Indian men can be, when it comes to how they treat woman.The film also has an interesting narrative technique, albeit one that can sometimes work against it. It is non-linear, not just in space and time as it cuts between the present day and place where Krishnamurthy is and the lead up to what happens to Smriti, but it also has continuously shifting points of view - the past is carried forward bit by bit through the people who Smriti encounters along the way. However, this constant back-and-forth may tend to make you restless; the present day portions often seem like speed-breakers in the narrative. In fact, for a film that is only 96 minutes long, it actually seems far longer than that. The pace of the narrative sags often, with the screenplay meandering in the present day portions. Still, because of the nervous anticipation that looms large throughout and the performance of the lead cast, it still doesn't bore you. Adil Hussain, who plays Krishnamurthy, is excellent. The desperation of a father, yet the sense of calm that he exudes even in tough situations, (contributed to, perhaps, by the fact that Krishnamurthy spent so many years in the US), those tears that he fights so hard to keep within, everything about his performance is almost perfect. I found his English dialogue delivery tinged with an ever so slight accent, but it is still heartening to see that an Indian film that is heavy in English largely stay away from terrible accents. It was also good to see Roshni Achreja after so long, and she was extremely natural as Meera. Some of the supporting cast did seem to struggle, especially the younger ones. Raaghav Chanana, last seen in that disaster Rangrezz as Jackky's friend, has a good presence, though I couldn't help wonder if that baritone was indeed his.Maya Tideman, who plays the pivotal role of Smriti, is a bit of a mixed bag. While the manner in which she emotes and delivers dialogue is often a little raw, she has a presence that seems to strangely do justice to the complex character that she plays. Your heart reaches out to her character not only because of the gruesome things that happen to her, but also she makes a connect with the sense of idealism and purity she radiates. And when I say purity, it isn't some misplaced sense of 'feminine purity', but just that of being a good human being.Despite some of the issues in pacing and the questions that you ask of the screenplay, Lessons in Forgetting is an important film because of how brave the film is in terms of subject and narrative. The only way our cinema is going to get better is if we whole-heartedly support films like this. So whether you choose to watch it in the theatre or whether you wait for the DVD to be released, I just hope that you pay to watch the film; Lessons in Forgetting deserves it.]"
267,"[I wonder if a ghost/witch story is, by default, a good vs. evil (pun intended) story. Ek Thi Daayan tries to underline it further, if possible. The able cast and gripping first hour, unfortunately, can't do much for the dwindling, unwieldy second hour. Yet, it is not your typical Hindi horror film, it does manage to get you nervous a few times.The first half has a lovely build-up indeed. It is interesting to see the creative interpretation of a child. I also loved the way it keeps you hanging between a child's imagination and that you don't want to believe it. Even so, a connect with the characters is missing. You don't know why you are supposed to feel for this cool magician who seems to be disturbed by some hallucinations. You don't know why you should care for this couple. The backstory comes, but a little too late for you to go back and have feelings for the characters. Also, whatever emotional attachment you are made to have is more because there are children whose safety is  involved. But, that doesn't last too long. Yet, you are gripped by the situation in the backstory. Another major contributor to keeping you rooted to your seat is the cast. All the main leads from the kids to Emraan Hashmi perform well. Can't say the same about the supporting actors, especially Pawan Malhotra or Rajatava Dutta. The kids on the other hand Vishesh Tiwari who plays the young Bobo (Emraan Hashmi) and his younger sister behave like children would and that is always refreshing to see in our films.Thankfully, there is one thing you come out with and it is Konkana Sen Sharma's haunting face. As much credit to the makeup and special effects department as it to her naturally beautiful eyes and her use of them. Emraan Hashmi gets to play the quintessential spooked out guy, in this horror film. So he gets spooked, alright. Huma Qureshi has a more or less plain role and does whatever little she can do with it. Kalki Koechlin has the smallest roles of them all, but she creates an intrigue about herself that is consistent. The inconsistency is all reserved for the last hour of the film which comes with random songs and even worse twists. At the end of the film, there are few sub-plots that make you wonder why they found a place in the film at all. On the other hand, there are some themes that are touched upon but left half-done, like a child's dreamy world, or the struggle between good and bad or logic and faith.And as is usual with all horror films, why don't witches and ghosts go directly for the kill, instead of trying to warm their subject up to themselves or killing random people associated with subject rather than the subject themselves. In that sense then, Ek Thi Daayan is like any other horror film. Thankfully, it varies from them in that it tries to stay clear of the standard mechanisms of horrifying - loud background score, etc. It also does creep you every once in a while. If only, the climax was at interval point.]"
268,"[""The purest form of cinema is life."" - AnonymousIf there's one film in recent times that underlines the statement above, it is Gajendra Ahire's Touring Talkies. An honest, heartfelt and pertinent movie about the movies, Ahire's latest is the kind of film that can make anyone who loves cinema shed a tear, if only for the sake of their own love for it.From being a thriving business and the only way cinema was consumed in India commercially in the early 20th century, touring talkies are now all but extinct; alive only in certain pockets of rural India, but barely so. Gajendra Ahire shows us a peek into the lives of those whose livelihoods still depend on setting up makeshift tents and projecting film inside it by night, while leading the existence of nomads by day. He does it by telling us the story of Chandi, a woman of infinite will and energy, in what has unfortunately and unfairly come to become a man's world.In showing us Chandi's journey, Ahire shows us life; he shows us how cinema mirrors society and never the other way around; he shows us that cinema exists even if a camera does not. Because, you see, cinema exists where there is a beating heart and the basest and most primal of emotions, irrespective of the presence or lack of an observer. But Chandi's life does have an observer, in the form of a filmmaker from Mumbai, who initially enters her life only because he wants his film, acclaimed on the festival circuit, to now be screened at the touring talkies. The enterprising Chandi is also a bit of a cinema expert, if only in the manner in which she understands the very concept of the fact that life drives it. She understands the art of cinema, as well as the commerce. She seems to understand that even commercial cinema is derived from an art form, and even artistic cinema needs to be sold. And watch how they gently rib one of the big commercial successes of recent times, one that made tons of money despite being as bad as it was. With beautiful little touches, Ahire shows us how much Chandi loves cinema, and in doing so, he reminds us how much we love cinema as well. Touring talkies are dying, and from the looks of it, the Internet may end up killing conventional brick-and-mortar cinema halls as well. But cinema will live on, no matter what. Yes, the screenplay of the film needed to be tighter, and weightier, if I may say so. It meanders a bit, tends to sag slightly, and does have the odd implausible turn. We also never fully see just why the filmmaker, Avinash, embarks on such an emotionally intense journey with a touring talkie, why he puts his own life on the backburner to be a part of someone else's. Love for cinema, perhaps; but it needed to be written stronger. But the maturity with which Gajendra Ahire directs, overshadows the flaws in the writing. In fact, Ahire is easily one of the most mature filmmakers India has currently. The manner in which he frames and composes his shots, what each shot and scene conveys; everything about his filmmaking shows maturity and an understanding of the art and science of cinema. Even technically, the film holds its own. Amol Gole's cinematography is top notch; the wonderful earthy colour palette brings the frames alive. Also, hat-off to maestro Ilaiyaraja's music and background score. Once again, he shows that few understand what a scene needs musically better than him. It is lively and electric when required, and subtly haunting when the need arises. I didn't particularly understand the need to have English lyrics for songs, but then, it perhaps is reflective of the personality of Avinash - an English-speaking, city-bred filmmaker with almost European sensibilities when it comes to his outlook towards cinema.The throbbing, pulsating heart of the film is Trupti Bhoir's performance as Chandi. She sheds her inhibitions, exhibits a look that few female leads in cinema would dare, and pumps in her all into Chandi. She is a livewire, and she literally lives the character. Subodh Bhave as Avinash does well, as always. He does look like a bit of a misfit at times, but his pleasing presence makes up for it. Kishor Kadam and Milind Shinde in supporting roles don't have much to do, but the two of them always seem to get into the skin of characters they play, which they do here as well.Quite like how Martin Scorsese's Hugo was his love letter to the movies, Touring Talkies is  for Gajendra Ahire. It is a film that needs to be seen for many reasons, the most important one of them being sheer passion for cinema, and to understand what the sound of the whirring projector means to some of us. Watch Touring Talkies on the big screen, if only to respect that medium which is most disrespected and misused. Perhaps you'll see why, for some of us, cinema is all about life, and life is all about cinema.]"
269,"[The Host, based on a novel by Stephenie 'Twilight' Meyer and directed by Andrew Niccol, is easily one of the silliest films you'll see all year. A sappy, puke-inducing romance set in a future where aliens have invaded Earth and have taken over the bodies of nearly every human being, save for a few. The only thing the film has even remotely going for it is that the visuals don't tire you, even if nearly everything else about the film makes you want to pull your hair out. The film tells us the story of Melanie, a human whose body is now host to an alien soul; that, by the way, is the modus operandi of these aliens. Except that the feisty Melanie is one of the rare humans who is able to fight the alien - an inner battle that occurs between two souls in one body. The reason for this? Didn't I mention something about puke earlier?One of the fundamental flaws in the film, one that anyone with even a quarter of a squid's brain will wonder about, is why exactly we have a problem with these aliens. They are largely peace-loving, and an opening voiceover tells us that these aliens have actually done planet Earth a world of good; there is no violence at all, and the Earth is more beautiful than ever before. In fact, the film is actually a celebration of the glorious faults of humankind. We are greedy, violent beings, who often succumb to carnal calls, who will invariably break the rules and who won't think twice about putting loads of other human lives in danger, if it benefits us individually in some way. The 'aliens' are the exact opposite, not to mention the fact that they are far more technically advanced than us. Yet, somehow, the film tries to sell us the fact that humans deserve to rule the earth far more than these aliens do.That apart, the romance aspect of the film is so inane, so absolutely silly, that all you want is for everyone in love in the film to die; a gruesome death. Unfortunately for us, that doesn't seem to be the way Stephenie Meyer operates. I must confess, I've never watched or read anything of the Twilight series. And considering how it is a standing joke in pop culture, I've always wondered just how bad is Twilight any way. Well, if Twilight is even half as silly as The Host, I'm glad I stayed away from it.What's surprising is Andrew Niccol's decision to direct this film. I've liked a number of his previous films, not just the ones he's directed, but the ones he's written as well. The former include cult hit Lord of War, the cerebral Gattaca, and even that guilty indulgence In Time, while the latter include films like The Terminal and The Truman Show, amongst others. He's always seemed to have a fondness for films set in the future, and he's almost always managed to make them reasonably convincing. The Host, however, is an unmitigated disaster. It doesn't help at all that not one of the characters and faces in the film appeal to you in any way. The way the characters have been written, and the performances of the cast - both are mostly bland. Only William Hurt and Diane Kruger from the supporting cast make any impact. Saoirse Ronan, who plays Melanie and who has to virtually anchor the film throughout, tries her best, but really comes up quite short.Even for a sci-fi film, The Host is filled with so many logical inconsistencies and screenplay problems that you're all but waiting for the film to just get over as soon as possible, perhaps so that you can flush away the experience of the film at the earliest. In fact, if there really existed an alien race like the one in the film and if they ever saw The Host, they'd probably break their own non-violent ethics and shoot themselves in the head.]"
270,"[After his biopic on the Marathi poet-saint Sant Tukaram, director Chandrakant Kulkarni is back with something that is a little more up his alley. A dramatic, often humourous and slightly silly, take on the political and bureaucratic class of our country, and an attempt to show how sometimes all it takes is a strong will to get the most difficult of things done despite the heavily flawed system that we are a part of. Aajcha Divas Majha remains watchable primarily because of a strong anchor that is the character of the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, and the performance of Sachin Khedekar who is terrific in that role.Strong, upright, honest, slightly egotistical but also always conscientious, Vishwasrao Mohite is the current Chief Minister of Maharashtra; one who has fought off devious political manoeuvres, some from within his own party, to retain his post. Aajcha Divas Majha tells the story of one particular day in his life, when he decides to take on a system that he himself is right at the top of. Like all character-based and dialogue driven dramas, (particularly when it comes to Indian regional films), Aajcha Divas Majha, despite ranging from silly to far-fetched to downright implausible, is also nearly continuous, indulgent fun. The humour spans the gamut from loud to campy to sharp, but it perhaps was the only way this film could have been treated for it to hold the audience for so long. Underneath the silly humour, the film is also a commentary on the manner in which the first response to any request by our politicians and bureaucrats is, ""No, it can't be done,"" followed by a long-drawn period of needless paperwork, followed by invariable nepotism, scams, corruption and the likes. My chief grouse with the film was the fact that every character in the film except for three - Chief Minister Vishwasrao Mohite, his PA, Shinde, and Mr. Rahimatpurkar, the top IAS official the CM takes on - seems to be a buffoon. Because of this, the silly humour that I mentioned earlier pervades the entire runtime of the film. Also, despite the film being well-intentioned, and the noble symbolism behind the cause that the CM takes up, the cause itself is quite absurd, and will often make you wonder about the rationale behind it. Needless to say, it is Sachin Khedekar who walks away with top honours from this film. What he manages to do, through his character, is show us the kind of leader we need in our country. True, his character has been written to be slightly populist; even honest and strong-willed politicians in real life will rarely ever take on the system the way he does in the film. But Khedekar makes us forget this for two-and-a-little hours of our lives. A far more real character, and almost equally well played by Mahesh Manjrekar, is that of IAS big shot, Rahimatpurkar. Representative of what ails our bureaucracy despite having a number of dynamic and intelligent people in it, he is the perfect foil to the idealism of CM Vishwasrao Mohite. Another character that wins your heart, albeit in a clearly manipulative manner, is that of Shinde, who plays the PA to the CM. Slightly reminiscent of the character of Paresh Rawal from Shankar's 'Nayak - The Real Hero', he is caught between adhering to protocol, and going against the tide with the man who is his boss. Played quite well by Hrishikesh Joshi, who always has a pleasing presence anyway, he often makes you smile.A small word on the late Rajen Kothari, who was the cinematographer of this film. A man who shot so many films that have gone against the commercial norms of our film industry, his work in the film is good as usual, though I suspect that digital capture and projection didn't do justice to it. His presence, of course, will sorely be missed in the industry.Aajcha Divas Majha isn't a great film by any stretch of imagination. In fact, only the truly generous would go so far as to even call it a good film. What it does manage to do though, is rarely lose the attention of the audience because, let's face it, we love seeing our political and bureaucratic class take each other on. It had the potential to be a seminal film on Indian politics, but never even goes close to fulfilling that potential. Still, it makes for a fun watch.]"
271,"[Ram vs. Raavan is a simple enough good vs. evil fight. Unless the struggle is between the Ram and Raavan in you. Nautanki Saala has this very intriguing conflict set at its heart - the one within. Remarkably enough, it also manages, to a great extent, to keep things light with quippy dialogue. Unfortunately though, it slacks off more often than not, the story loses its way and that kind of intrigue exists only in one of the characters. The plot starts out with a man of today called Ram (Ayushman Khurana), who is too good to be true, saving a stranger's life. Interestingly enough he plays Raavan in a stage show that he directs too. The quirky treatment to an outlandish start gives the film a dream-like ambiance. But it is pretty amazing how the atmosphere created doesn't let the implausibility of it all bother you. However, that lasts only for the first hour or so.The turn of events in the second half take Nautanki Saala into the regular girl-boy zone. Except for glimpses of the protagonist's struggle with himself, the situations become pretty ordinary. Not to mention, other than Ram and Mandar (Kunal Roy Kapoor), the other characters are lame from the outset. Especially the women. While Chitra (Gaelyn Mendonca) is refreshingly understanding her maturity isn't consistent. The other lady, Nandini (Pooja Salvi) is dumb and dumber both. That more than one man would fall in love with her, is extremely unconvincing. Also, neither Chitra nor Pooja are helped by the performances. Both Gaelyn and Pooja are plastic dolls given trendy styles to wear. The men however, do a magnificent job of keeping you engaged with their performances. Kunal Roy Kapoor's Mandar is eternally depressed and yet, quirkily funny evoking the side in you that enjoys dark humor. A few characters break into a regional language which seems both unnatural as a part of the film and is superficially delivered by the actors. Ayushman Khurana wins you over once again with a charming performance. He plays both Ram and the part of him trying to keep his internal Raavan at bay, with equal conviction. All this while making it look natural and effortless. Expect to be blown over by the way he kisses his girl - one of the most natural, comfortable and convincing on-screen kisses I have seen in Hindi cinema. It's pretty much these two and the witty dialogue that keeps you going for the 2+ hours of the film. It slows down considerably, picking pace very unevenly, and once in a longish while. The quirks are enjoyable, but there is enough slapstick humor, in the form of sexual and toilet humor and the usual slapping around and falling people, attempting to make you laugh. The ambiance created by the colors, lighting and music too is very slick and helps to keep the dragging parts alive.Yet, with the given premise, it's sad that the narrative didn't take itself beyond the obvious Ramayan references. The hat tip towards how each one of us wears a mask and churns out a life full of drama for ourselves is subtle and enjoyable. But, that it all boils down to a very ordinary romance takes all that away from Nautanki Saala!]"
272,"[The big problem with Joseph Kosinski's sophomore feature, the sci-fi magnum opus 'Oblivion', based on a graphic novel written by Kosinski himself, is that, like his 2010 debut film TRON: Legacy, the focus seems to be more on how the film looks, as opposed to truly delving deep into the psyche of the characters, what they feel and why they feel the way they do; that and the fact that you can almost see the effort that has gone into making the film 'feel' like an epic. Perhaps some day filmmakers will realize that epics aren't 'made'; they just happen.The film is set in a post-apocalyptic future, one where Earth is nothing more than a barren wasteland, after an invasion and subsequent war with mysterious creatures known only as 'Scavengers'; the war was won, but Earth was lost. Mankind has since developed an alternate plan for survival, and Jack and Victoria are teammates manning a station; they're on a mission that is a part of this plan.Unable to shake off a strong deja vu of a number of previous sci-fi action films, including The Matrix, Inception, Total Recall and Source Code to name a few, Oblivion still had loads of potential. The film starts off well enough, amidst gorgeous visuals, the sepulchral feel and the intricately enigmatic air that is created by the images of a battered Earth. Also, there is something so poetic about a vast, endless canvas that has only one man and one woman in it to represent life and the memory of what it means to be a human being. And then, there is the emotional core of the film - the fact that memories of true love can never fully be erased no matter what; that is the kind of thought that has the potential to melt even the most hardened cynics. Unfortunately, instead of exploring this emotion further, the film turns into an action thriller and a mystery. Even that could actually have worked if the film had a tight, gripping screenplay to back it up. The fact that the events unfold at a generous almost indulgent pace, again pointing to the fact that the attempt was to create a modern day classic, weakens the film further.One of the film's other big weaknesses is the fact that what should have been the soul of the film, the love between Tom Cruise's character Jack, and Julia, the character played by Olga Kurylenko, just doesn't come through; the two of them share the chemistry of a pair of wooden blocks. Andrea Riseborough, who plays Jack's partner Victoria, is quite lovely, though she is eventually only reduced to a side character. Morgan Freeman is functional, but having him on screen does make you take things a little more seriously, sometimes.Tom Cruise, I've always maintained, is one of last few 'movie stars' we have left. By that, I mean that he has this ability to make the most incredulous on-screen goings-on look completely believable; he almost lives the magic that cinema can be. This remarkable feature of the man is actually one of the only things that doesn't make Oblivion a total waste of your time. Another undeniable plus point is the cinematography, by this year's Academy Award winner for Life of Pi, Claudio Miranda. True, the film is heavily embellished with VFX, but it does look beautiful. The third aspect that marginally redeems the film is its soundtrack; credited to three composers, it is a nervous, edgy and heavily orchestral sound that is often reminiscent of a Hans Zimmer score, a tad over-cooked, but nevertheless one that stays true to the genre of the film. Oblivion eventually amounts to a lost opportunity; a potential epic that doesn't even go close. A majority of the audience will be quite happy to walk out after the film and forget about it soon after. And yet, all of the above are my thoughts as a student of cinema critiquing a cinematic work. Deep down, the part of me that believes that movies are more real than real life, actually loved Oblivion just for the potential that it had, even though it never fulfills it. I completely immersed myself into the indulgence of the film, the haunting feel, the sad but beautiful frames of a thriving planet reduced to rubble and that core emotional thought; that true love is a memory worth fighting for, worth dying for. I loved Oblivion, even though it offers plenty of reasons to not be loved.]"
273,"[A little over two years after the poetic Blue Valentine, the Derek Cianfrance-Ryan Gosling combo is back with The Place Beyond the Pines, a film that has so much going for it and yet seems to have something missing; something you can't pinpoint for sure, but you can almost feel it while watching the film. If I had to try my best to describe what's missing, I'd say, ""A destination."" That can be both, a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it. I've always disliked it when someone, after they know I've watched a particular film, asks me, ""So what is the film about?"" I hate attempting to distill an entire film into a few lines of prose. But with this particular film, I wouldn't be able to even if I tried. The Place Beyond the Pines talks about characters, about choices and about consequences. It deals with loneliness, with morality, with responsibility and with survival instincts. Not out of laziness, but for the purpose of illustrating something, I'm reproducing the official synopsis of the film below. ""A motorcycle stunt rider turns to robbing banks as a way to provide for his lover and their newborn child, a decision that puts him on a collision course with an ambitious rookie cop navigating a department ruled by a corrupt detective."" That, dear reader, is precisely what the film is not about. Ryan Gosling's motorcycle stunt rider and Bradley Cooper's rookie cop are mere eyewashes; quite like Blue Valentine, this film too is set around men who are failures, even if some of them seem to don the garb of being successful. In fact, Derek Cianfrance seems to have made it a pattern. The men in his films always seem to be talented people who are perpetual underachievers, no matter how hard they try. The women, on the other hand, seem have to deal with the grotesqueries of their respective men's personalities. The film also subtly shows the butterfly effect; the consequences to one's actions, that are often so far-reaching in time and space, that you can only truly know it when you are watching it from the outside; if you are a viewer at the cinema, or if you are God. What defines right and wrong? Does one right undo a wrong that has been done? No? Then do two rights undo one wrong? No? Then how many rights does it take? Who defines it? The world is an orgy of shades of grey, and cinema very rarely tries to explore that. Even the films that do portray grey characters often do it at a superficial level - they'll show a backstory of a man seeking redemption for some aspect of his personality, ultimately coming up trumps in the end.Cianfrance fastidiously avoids black and white, with every single character that appears before you. They've all got chinks in their personality, and none of them ever venture too much out of the grey spectrum. And every single character in the film, no matter how big or small, is a loner. In fact, the sense of loneliness hangs through the film.The terrific cast, especially Gosling and Cooper, play out the melancholy quite well. Gosling's character does seem like a cocktail of some of his previous characters, particularly the ones from Drive and Blue Valentine, but he always seems to add in that little bit extra in his voice and body language, which makes him so great in every role that he plays. Bradley Cooper's character, now that I think of it, also seems to be a mix of his characters from Limitless and Silver Linings Playbook, except that he actually manages to seem like an uncomfortable young rookie when he has to. Also, his character has the widest, steepest graph in the film, and he pulls it off.The talented Ben Mendelsohn, again, plays a character that reminds you of him in Andrew Dominik's Killing Them Softly, but he is excellent as always. Eva Mendes looks appropriately haggard, in keeping with her character. I've never been a fan of her acting prowess. Here too, she's good, but never great. Ray Liotta is superb, subtly menacing, in a tiny role.When I left the theatre after the film, I couldn't believe just how much the film had traversed in its runtime. It meandered often, and some of the situations were downright implausible. Still, because of the sheer pertinence and relevance of the some of the questions that the film raises, it is bound to gnaw away at you even hours after you've watched it. Then, there are some beautiful frames that say so much; ones that will stay with you for a while. The Place Beyond the Pines is the kind of film that will reward you for your patience, but it'll take some time to realize that what you got in return was actually a reward.]"
274,"[In over a quarter of a century of my unflinching and passionate romance with cinema, I've only ever jumped out of my seat once, in reaction to the goings-on in a film. That was two decades ago, in 1993, during what was one of the earliest movies I ever watched on the big screen and my first Hollywood film ever - Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park. Today, two decades later, it happened again. The film? Jurassic Park in 3D. And once again, I jumped during the exact same scene that startled the bollocks out of me as a naive and impressionable 7-year old.Indeed, as I saw frame after frame of grand vision after so long, all those childhood memories of experiencing true magic for the first time in my life came gushing back; movies had always fascinated me even before Jurassic Park, but there in front of me were magnum frames of the kind that I hadn't ever seen before, not even when, less than a year earlier, I watched Amitabh Bachchan, standing in the deserts of Afghanistan, thunder, 'Mera naam Badshah Khan hai!'Whether the 3D re-release of the film was called for at all is a discussion for another day. Now that the film is back in theatres, it is time to celebrate the film and the man who made it. Who can forget those iconic shots and scenes, like the first time Sam Neill, who plays a paleontologist, a man whose life has been devoted to imagining what dinosaurs must have been like after excavating their skeletons, spots a real live, walking and breathing dinosaur, a gigantic brachiosaurus, in front of him. Or those terrifying scenes where the T-Rex escapes its paddock in the nighttime, unleashing its terror on two unarmed vehicles, one of them with children in it. Or that scene with the velociraptors in the kitchen. Unforgettable moments of cinema history, which were brought to life because of the visionary conviction of Steven Spielberg.Yes, this time round, I couldn't help noticing how broadly the characters have been painted. The simplistic manner in which they observe and react, the predictable side track about Sam Neill's reluctant paternal instincts, the manner in which Laura Dern's character is shown to break gender stereotypes, Jeff Goldblum's manic naysayer with a roving eye or even the great Richard Attenborough's kindly eccentricity; all of them seem too vanilla - something Spielberg has been accused of throughout his phenomenal career. But with this one, critics can take a hike - this film is for those wide-eyed little ones with imaginations that us adults left behind years ago. As I keep saying, it is sheer movie magic, created with spectacular technical wizardry.If there is one thing Hollywood deserves credit for, it is ambition. They've time and again pushed the limits of scale, vision and VFX in cinema, sparing no cost in attempting to achieve the impossible. Yet, so many years since Spielberg's cult blockbuster made hair, all across the world, stand on its end, I believe they are yet to surpass what was achieved with Jurassic Park. And yes, even if you aren't the greatest fan of watching films in 3D, this is one film where the 3D never hurts the eye and adds great depth to frames; enough, at least, for you to not mind the glasses at all. So if you watched the film in the theatre years back and loved it, or if you have children who've never watched the film, or if you yourself have never watched it, or if you have parents who haven't watched, or - well the list is endless, I suggest you visit or re-visit the film in theatres. You may have aged, but Jurassic Park has not. ]"
275,"['dum hai boss' goes Seema (Tapsee Pannu) every time Sid (Ali Zafar) woos her with cheesiest of lines. This is just after Seema claims she needs something extra to be wooed. All you can say is 'dumb hai boss'.  After this happens a few times, you realise that that's what David Dhawan thinks of his audience. Dumb, of course, not 'dum'! Chashme Baddoor makes you wonder how low story ranks in this filmmakers' priorities. Situations pop out of nowhere. Even for a ""mindless"" script, a couple of scenes are outside reason - like a twist in the Joseph-Josephine track or people landing up in jail to arrive at a convoluted plot point. These make the film even more annoying. Well, the frustration begins from scene one with absolutely painful performances. From Siddharth's over-zealous gestures to Ali Zafar's pretentious dialogue delivery to Tapsee Pannu's cute-yet-flat portrayal of Seema as the film's center of attention - it is one assault on your ears after another. Then again Tapsee Pannu needs another role for an opinion to made about her talent. Divyendu Sharma makes the most out of the supposedly funny lines he is given with some decent timing. Anupam Kher and Bharti Achrekar get to make a fool out of themselves once again. I'd have liked to say that Rishi Kapoor and Lilette Dubey are the saving grace of the film but that would imply that the film has some grace, so let's that be.I don't know if the performances or the dialogues are more frustrating. The general concept of 'comedy' or 'entertainment' is very lame, making it difficult to believe, how low the standard of humor is. And this is despite rock-bottom expectations. Shouldn't slapping, as a mechanism to make people laugh, have been out of fashion in the 50s? Scampering, in fast-forward was funny when Charlie Chaplin did it for the first few times. And pun stops being smart use of words at age 10. Even the silliest of silly comedies from the leave-your-brains-behind genre should have gone beyond these done-to-death tools of making its audience laugh. Oh yeah, and their first cousins, toilet and sexual humor. Needless to say, David Dhawan's Chashme Baddoor has the lowest possible form of gags in each of the above categories. Having the likes of Anupam Kher and Rishi Kapoor mouth them makes me want to cry. More so because they try to spoof  Sholay's mausiji sequence or enact a SMS forward take on Chak De! India's 'sattar minute'.For the sake of completeness, I have to mention the original Chashme Buddoor. Chashme Baddoor chooses to completely ignore all that was good about Chashme Buddoor - the simplicity and the satire. Instead, it goes on to make what was bad, worse. For example, the climax is made even more implausible. Amidst this then, it is interesting that there was some attempt at being different in the way the songs were shot. They are loud and are far from melodious, as expected. But some smart editing and camerawork makes them stand out in this otherwise thoughtless execution. Other than that though, there isn't much they could do. After all, Chashme Buddoor had music from the pre-70s to pay tribute to, whereas yesteryears for current films is the 90s.It is difficult to decide if my urge to cry was more because of the silly lines or because some part of the audience was enjoying it whole-heartedly. Some silliness is just so bad that it makes you laugh, Chashme Baddoor's brand of stupidity doesn't even fall in that category. ""What else did you expect?"" Is a question I have no answer to. What I was thinking while drifting away from the films abysmal comedy though, was this - last week's Himmatwala fell pretty much flat on its face. What will the David Dhawans and Sajid Khans of the world do when in a few years the audience starts wholeheartedly rejecting brainless entertainment?]"
276,"[How many times have we watched an American film, where a character dials 911 and cops come bursting through the door soon after? While scores of films have shown cops to be the heroes, often laying their lives for the sake of justice, very rarely has anyone ever a peeked into the lives of the people who actually answer that 911 call. On the surface, it seems like any other call centre - continuous calls, mostly silly, with a caller who is almost always unreasonably agitated. But then, on a lot of calls, also hinge matters of life and death. Anyone who can read, can fix your problem with your cellular operator or your toaster. But a 911 call can be a different story altogether.It is perhaps this aspect of Brad Anderson's The Call that is most fascinating, because you get to realize the worth of anonymous heroes, who fade into oblivion after answering the call that probably saved lives. Starting off by humanizing these anonymous voices, then moving on to what is actually quite a taut thriller before ultimately descending into near-absurdity when it tries to move in for the kill, The Call is an uneven film that engages you often, but ends up leaving you quite disappointed as you walk out.Halle Berry plays Jordan, a seasoned 911 operator who is damn good at her job. One of her calls, however, doesn't go quite as expected. Brad Anderson knows how to craft a thriller, that much you have to concede. And what he seems to enjoy a lot is lacing his thriller with just that slight tinge of a horror element. His 2004 film is almost seminal in this regard, frequently flitting the boundaries between thriller and horror with utmost ease. He tries something similar with The Call, though toning down the horror element quite a bit, making it very subtle and visceral. Full marks to him for trying, but the end result isn't nearly as thrilling or horrifying as he had hoped. The big problem with the film lies in the last half hour of the film. The most important aspect of writing and directing a thriller is knowing when the thrill has reached a peak, and easing the audience off that peak with assuredness. The disadvantage that an out-and-out thriller has is that the audience invariably catches up, making it hard to leave them on a high, unlike other genres. Also, the very premise of the last half hour is absurd, because it goes against the fundamental concept that the film starts off with - the life of a 911 operator. Halle Berry, in a role that she can sleepwalk through, expectedly does a fair job. The rest of the cast pretty much has to stand by and watch her do her thing. Michael Eklund hams it up a bit as a psychopath, overdoing the crazy quite often. However, and this was quite a surprise, I quite liked how his character was written. The reason for him being the way he is, intrigued me quite a bit. His character has a gamut of emotions and layers to it, and is revealed only bit by bit, making it an unexpected facet in this genre of film. Very rarely does a film attempt this. But this eventually also adds to why the climax of the film doesn't work; it also goes against the fundamental concept of his character. With its crisp 94-minute runtime and brisk pace, The Call often engages you, but it ultimately disappoints. It is never unwatchable, but it just never gets as compelling as it could have been, with the absurd climax being the final nail in the coffin. ]"
277,"[Training Day and Shooter director Antoine Fuqua's latest film Olympus Has Fallen is the kind of generic Hollywood action film that the world has been seeing for ages now, with only a slight change in setting; this time the action occurs inside what should be the most guarded and fortified building in the world - The White House. Never easing up on the corn or the been-there-seen-that, the film mercifully whizzes by you fast enough to make it a breezy watch, albeit one where you are always only being patronizing towards it.Mike Banning, erstwhile head of US President Benjamin Asher's security detail and now reassigned to other duties because of a tragedy that occurred on his watch, is rudely jolted back into the thick of the action when a terrorist group takes over and occupies the White House in a 9/11-meets-26/11-style brute force attack, holding the nation to ransom. With the clock ticking, Banning is the only hope that the US government has in preventing a full-scale catastrophe, while tensions are rising between two East Asian nuclear powers, the conflict between whom is the root behind the terror attack in the first place.The only time the film really had me thinking was a bit was early on, during the initial attack on the White House; because I couldn't help feel that no matter how outlandish the events unfolding in the film looked, the White House and other such buildings across the world would probably be quite vulnerable to a well-planned attack. That moment of serious thought didn't last long however, as, in the most blatantly obvious attempt at symbolism, the pyramidal top of the Washington Monument, the tallest structure in Washington DC, comes crashing down a few minutes before the White House is taken and someone exclaims in Hollywood-ese, ""Olympus Has Fallen!"" (Olympus, of course, is the mythical home of the Greek Gods, and if it really is the code name that is used for the White House, then the US Government clearly makes no bones about what they think of themselves.)From then on, because of its relentless pace and a few truly cheeky lines of dialogue, you play along with the silliness and the self-righteous Americanism that the film indulges in, even though you have no doubt how the film will pan out. Mike Banning, of course, is your everyday John McClane-type action hero - enterprising, badass and always a step ahead of the evil mastermind, even if he pretends to always be playing catch-up. He even channels Bond and Rambo often while systematically attempting to win back the White House. With some veteran actors playing bit roles as various US Government officials - Morgan Freeman, Melissa Leo, Robert Forster and Angela Bassett all make appearances - the collective seriousness with which everyone takes their roles can make you grin. Aaron Eckhart as the President makes for a dashing and charming First Man, no doubt, but I wonder how they thought of casting someone who looks younger than Teddy Roosevelt or JFK ever did while in office, as the US President. It adds another layer to the already existing farfetchedness of the film. The film, of course, belongs to Gerard Butler, who plays Mike Banning. Armed with his usual charm that is embellished by his accent, Butler makes the best use of his lines and the action he gets to have fun with, making sure that things remain almost always watchable. Rick Yune as the renegade mastermind behind the attacks just doesn't make for a convincing-enough villain, for me. The film has been given a grim feel and it never stands out visually, maintaining an all-too-familiar look throughout. Strangely enough, some of the VFX in the film was quite bad; something you don't expect in a film like this. The action set pieces have been executed reasonably, but nothing in the film seems like you haven't seen it before, which as I've repeated often, is one of the big problems in the film. As it brisk-walks to a climax (that can't shake of a Mr. India deja vu), Olympus Has Fallen is the kind of no-brainer film that is some measure of fun while it lasts, without ever truly impressing you. So if, like me, you get the feeling more than once that you're watching King Leonidas attempt to save Harvey Dent from Zao, the sidekick henchman in Die Another Day, then we must meet up for a high-five. ]"
278,"[Where does one begin with a film like Himmatwala? You know its going to range from garish to extremely over-the-top, it being a Sajid Khan ""entertainer"". With the ""the 80s are back"" announcement, you knew you had to leave your brain behind. Yet, somehow Himmatwala makes it worse than what you are ready for - from the righteous brave-heart to the idealistic mother to the caricaturish villain to the supposedly village setting to the lousy one-liners, there isn't one moment that can hook you in.To start off, in its attempt to not copy the 1983 film, the 2013 version brings in  a few minor changes and a 'twist' which make the proceedings even more lame. Then you have Ravi (Ajay Devgn) cracking the poorest of poor jokes. Making him admit the awfulness in the very next line, only makes it worse (and when we thought it wasn't possible.)Similarly, Paresh Rawal breaking the fourth wall asking us to come towards him and go away from him with a  zooming in and out camera isn't funny to begin with. It gets even more tiresome when its repeated over and over, predictably. When you are so clearly reminded that you are watching a film, you cannot be expected to get remotely involved in the characters or the situations. So involved are Sajid Khan and company in not taking themselves seriously, that the villain doesn't scare and the hero doesn't inspire or invoke allegiance. All the supposedly powerful and/or emotional scenes seem lame because you aren't engaged in the story.Interestingly, Ravi's sister (Leena Jumani) gets a scene where she uncharacteristically takes charge of her life and it could imply a superficial hint at woman empowerment. But her action ultimately implies submission to what others in her life decide for her. Even if you'd like to give Himmatwala a benefit of doubt in that the social norms of the 80s apply, you realize you are being asked to believe that any of this is realistic. Having said that, Leena Jumani is an actor who sticks out because of how quietly she plays her bit. In contrast you have this gang of very capable actors competing to look more idiotic than the next. You cannot blame Paresh Rawal, Mahesh Manjrekar or even Ajay Devgn for not making you laugh. Their timing seems to be perfect for what they've been asked to do. But, what they've been asked to do is so ridiculously not funny that you don't know what to feel for them. I would like to think that my 10-year old is too old for such juvenile non-humor. You know you have stooped to a new low when you find relief when the songs from the 80s start playing. Relief in nostalgia from 'nayano mein sapna' and ' taaki o taaki' - yep, certainly a low! I'd like to shift the blame to having to sit through 'thank God it's Friday' and 'bum pe laat' in comparison. I do questions myself, ""Why do I even bother with such films?"" ""Hope and curiosity"", besides the fact that I have taken it up as a job. I hope that there will be something, at least one scene, that's worth half-a-watch and I don't want to keep wondering what that'll be. However, feeble my reward be, Sajid Khan's Himmatwala has this curiously shot hypothetical situation in which he, for reason unknown, chooses to refer to Psycho. Not that I liked it or the way it was done, but it was very atypical of Sajid Khan. And that is enough for me, even if not good enough to recommend you watch it even if you have nothing better to do (unless your hope and curiosity are compelling).Himmatwala truly has nothing that even people reminiscing the 80s would enjoy. If someone really wants nostalgia, they'd go back to K Raghavendra Rao's Himmatwala, right? Why do you need a Sajid Khan for that?]"
279,"[The sequel to the 2009 film G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, G. I. Joe: Retaliation pretty much picks up from where the previous film left off. This time though, a number of new characters join some of the old to continue the battle, not just against the Joes' sworn enemy, the organization known as Cobra, but also a threat from within the US Government itself. A film that makes last week's Olympus Has Fallen look like Citizen Kane, the film is not much more than a continuous series of implausible situations and action set pieces that will mostly numb you of your sensory abilities for some time, post the film.Now, expecting logic in a G. I. Joe film is like expecting more than cow-dung from a Sajid Khan film, but what really makes it worse is that the one big draw the film had - the largest face on the posters of the film, that of Bruce Willis - is such a huge disappointment because he is hardly there in it. He breezily aces the scenes he's in, no doubt, but it so leaves you wanting for more. The rest of the film is largely exhausting and quite predictable, both in terms of plot as well as execution.When the President of the United States sends the G. I. Joe team on a tactical operation in Pakistan, things go awry, as the entire team is annihilated, save for Roadblock, Flint and Lady Jaye (none of whom appeared in the first film). What's worse, the entire G. I. Joe outfit has been branded as traitors. It is up to the survivors to erase the blot on the name of their dead compatriots, and to hunt down the people responsible for the deception.What I have always failed to understand with these big Hollywood action extravaganzas is how the writers and directors don't seem to feel the need to pace the film right, to give it a graph that will draw the audience in and make them feel the rise and fall in emotions, even if it is purely exhilaration from action than any real feelings towards the characters. The film maintains a breathless pace throughout, rarely taking its foot off the action pedal. The result is a film that becomes repetitive and tiresome after a while.Also, though this could be purely subjective because of a certain image in my mind, it seemed that director Jon M. Chu is not quite up to directing large-scale action films. (Jon M. Chu directed the last two Step Up films.) Even in a film whose very foundation is suspension of disbelief, action can only truly work if the viewer can make sense of it. Retaliation's sequences are massively mounted and some of them are actually imaginative in vision, but shoddily executed, relying on fast-moving objects and rapid cuts that distract viewers rather than involve them.It doesn't help that they only seem to want to cast non-actors in G. I. Joe films. Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock has a likeable presence but that's about it. No one else comes even close to making any sort of impact, unless one counts the scenes where Adrianne Palicki, who plays Lady Jaye, wears clothes meant to show off her, let's say, feminine side. The big disappointment, one I still can't get over considering how large his face was splashed in the promotions of the film, was the tiny role offered to Bruce Willis. Here's a man who knows how to kick backsides on screen, so why not use it to the full?The film does make slightly better use of 3D than most films have so far. Largely subtle, with the odd shots of shrapnel and even people flying directly at you, the 3D doesn't jar as much as it usually tends to. Still, I think it is about time Hollywood figures out that 3D isn't something that really excites viewers enough to want to pay a premium and then dim your vision for it. Not as torturous as the last Die Hard film but still nowhere close to being an exciting action film, G. I. Joe: Retaliation is really only for hardcore and exclusive action film fans. But for those like me who've grown up with G. I. Joe action figures and WWE, each of us has made far better action films in our heads, starring our plastic playmates, and you're always disappointed that Dwayne Johnson doesn't go Rock Bottom-ing and People's Elbow-ing the bad guys. ]"
280,"[It'd be safe to say that of the five people who showed up for the screening that I was at, at least 4 of them were there for Naseeruddin Shah. And what a cheat that turned out to be. Not that I was surprised. And actually, the tone he was talking in for the few seconds he is on screen, I am only thankful that there wasn't more of him. The film otherwise, is pretty much what you see in the trailers. There are people who can't sleep for whatever reason. There are other people who sleep well and through some ""bonding"" one from the latter group can sleep on behalf of one from the former group relieving the stress. As we are told (again in the trailer itself) if someone sleeps your sleep, they are also going to dream your dreams. There's no new knowledge beyond that, for the characters barely do anything after having new knowledge about each other. Obviously, the dreams makes for the bulk of Sona Spa and we would have such a boring if film if these dreams weren't deep and dark secrets of the sleepless people. Now, how people who don't sleep dream so that people who are sleeping for them can dream the same dream, is a minor technicality and thus not addressed at all. Even so, what an interesting premise this was for some psychoanalysis! The original person's dream is a representation of his deepest desires/insecurities. The dream though is so real for the sleep-worker that they believe them to be true. But, none of this is explored at all.Instead you get some superficial philosophical talk using lines that are supposed to sound profound. Except for Nivedita Bhattacharya (Meenakshi), Aahana Kumrah (Ritu) and the guy who plays Sachin (Indira's brother) all other actors are mostly stiff and the three mentioned are better only in comparison. Pooja Pradhan (Indira) actually looks like she's being held together by the make-up plastered on her face. In fact, the cinematography is so grainy that you can see the smallest pore on everyone's face. I don't know what artistic purpose this serves, but even in real life you cannot see the face in such gruesome detail. If only you saw even a fraction of that detail in coming up with stories of insomniacs that were complete. Or at least they'd have some meaning for the viewer, even if the meaning wasn't deciphered or understood completely. Watching Sona Spa is like having 15-20 minute boring dream played on repeat for two hours. I really wonder how Sona Spa would've turned out if it were a short. ]"
281,"[Aatma leaves you with many questions. Why are most horror films all the same? Why are they oh-so-lame? Why do they have to involve an artist who's a child? Are horrified adults too mild? These are not rhetorics, they are genuine questions. Aatma starts out, right from the trailers, with the premise of a dead dad wanting to be with his child. Aatma stays there pretty much right till the end. There is very little in terms of movement from this baseline. Sure, there are doctors, priests and murders, but they are pretty much predictable. And what's a horror film going to horrify you with, if you know what's going to happen next. Without that as a support, the audience has to more or less rely on the performances to feel for or against the characters. Nawazuddin Siddiqui does invoke disgust and anger even before he's shown on the screen. However, taking nothing away from his acting effort, those negative emotions are more directly correlated with the characterisation. Again, once it is invoked, it stays put. You cannot but ignore the fact that there was a decent chance of revealing his intentions gradually, thus building the drama to a high. But well, they let that cat out in the promos itself. Bipasha Basu does the drill of being a very scared, concerned mother. But, she can do only so much if the screenplay has her sleep away from her child who seems to be in fatal danger. At the risk of revealing a little detail, the said scene has Bipasha Basu's Maya sleep with her mom and be comforted by her and the daughter-in-danger is sleeping in another room! And what about our concern for our child artists? Should any human be put through the ordeal of acting in roles that require them to be possessed and murder people brutally (Doyel Dhawan) - at age 6! And this is not specific to this film, or even just Hindi films, why should any child be put through first giving those performances and then watching themselves on the screen. What kind of a messed up race are we, if we need to use the tenderness of age to entertain us? (I can only hope that the said artists aren't allowed to watch such of their films until they are of age. But, I know that is highly unlikely.)And the sad part is, it doesn't even spook us. We've seen it so many times over that we are now immune to possessed children. Oh well.I am nit-picking then when I point out a ""Whhaat?"" moment, when I see a school teacher sitting on her desk, while teaching - one-leg-over-another in a short skirt! Yeah, petty me. If I had to pick one positive in the entire film, it would be attempt at mood. The gloomy blues create the right atmosphere, even if it is pretty dark during day time. However, the background music and all the other elements bring the film down to below average. So, a courtesy tip towards science and God later, the film and your miseries end. Aatma is short, and even if it is certainly not sweet, you thank the writers for small mercies. ]"
282,"[After that little gem Gabhricha Paus, director Satish Manwar returns with Tuhya Dharma Koncha? (What's your religion?), the story of a tribal family that lives in a little village on the fringes of the Tiger Reserve in Melghat. Despite the brave choice of story - an interesting and pertinent one by all means - the film is let down by poor production value and, more importantly by the lack of true emotional heft.Kavadu, a tribal villager, is arrested by the police for a crime he didn't commit. While he is in jail, his wife Bhulabai, already encumbered with the responsibility of their two children, one of whom is an ailing infant, now also has to run from pillar to post trying to get Kavadu out. In dealing with these problems, she has to invariably turn to a band of Naxalites, and then to a Christian missionary priest for help. As the story progresses, the question that it invariably poses is the one asked in the title of the film.What immediately strikes you in Tuhya Dharma Koncha?? is the lack of production value. Obviously, budget constraints will always plague a film that genuinely tries to be different without catering to a mass audience. But with a largely static camera and groups of people like the villagers, the Naxals and the Christians numbering only in handfuls, the film ends up feeling more like theatre than cinema. The film also has a fairly flat graph throughout. You are always watching the suffering of a tribal family in rural Maharashtra, but it never escalates enough to grab at your throat. It always maintains a certain distance from the viewer. While the clear lack of attempt at infusing additional drama into the narrative is probably a directorial choice - indeed a mature one if that is the case - the fact remains that it fails to establish a strong emotional connect with the audience.The film is also very simplistic in its treatment of the groups I mentioned above. The Hindus, so clearly more consumed by rituals, festivals and tokenism than in any sort of progressive outlook; the Naxals with their one point militant communist agenda; the Christians with a more open outlook, derivative of the Western influences of the religion - each of these are painted in broad strokes, something that doesn't really do justice to the complex socio-political situations that a melting pot of these groups would doubtlessly create. Also, the film doesn't attempt to provide any sort of resolution to the important question that it asks in the title - again, a choice made by the filmmakers, but one that further underlines the fact that the film maintains a chasm between itself and the audience, who would want to take something away as food for thought from a film like this.The prime reason the film doesn't completely fail in engaging the audience is the performance of the cast. Upendra Limaye, who plays Kavadu, is a fine actor. He does really well as he portrays the anguish of an innocent man locked up in prison. Vibhawari Deshpande as Bhulabai is convincing as the almost gullible but emotionally strong wife, who doesn't hesitate in doing what needs to be done for the sake of her family. Kishor Kadam as the priest does a fair job as well, though his performances seem to very rarely differ from one another. Also, the entire cast as well as the director must be lauded for the use of the tribal Marathi dialect in the film. While that adds to the disconnect from the viewer to an extent, it can also actually aid in make you concentrate more to decipher them. (The film didn't have subtitles at the hall where I watched it.)Director Satish Manwar is clearly a brave man who intends to continue telling stories about those parts of Maharashtra that are hidden by the cosmopolitanism and progress associated with the Pune - Mumbai - Nashik triangle. Indeed, most of us forget that a large part of Maharashtra remains one of the most under-developed areas in the country. So I do hope that Manwar continues making films that show the harshness of life in these regions. For his attempt alone, Tuhya Dharma Koncha? must be supported, even though the film largely remains a surface-level exploration of the role that religion plays at a time when no one religion can fulfill the needs of man, not one that attempts to delve too deep. ]"
283,"[Easily the most poetic and haunting film I've watched on the big screen in a long time, (Anand Gandhi's Ship of Theseus comes a close second,) Paul Thomas Anderson's The Master is an extraordinarily melancholic and layered film that seems to be about so many things, and then again about nothing at all, all at once. But with this film, Paul Thomas Anderson once again underlines the fact that he is one of the most daringly original thinkers that American cinema has produced, ever.Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix, terrific in his return) is a broken man, a World War II seaman trying to deal with life in a post-war world. He is sexually frustrated, almost always high on booze (that he makes himself using commonplace ingredients that he finds at hand), and is perhaps looking for direction in his life. He seems to find this direction in the words and teachings of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman, beautifully nuanced), the founder of a philosophical stream of thought known as 'The Cause'. The core of the film is the mysterious relationship between the two polar opposites that Freddie and Dodd (called 'Master' by his followers) represent. Freddie is wayward, eccentric, filled with nervous energy that is constantly looking for an outlet, or better yet, a form of control. Dodd, on the other hand, seems always in control for the most. Freddie is, in many ways, looking for meaning in his life, something to bow down to, like a master. Dodd provides that to some extent, but there always seems to be something missing, something that you can't quite place. As the film strips away and lays bare before you the characters of Freddie and Dodd, it also hides so much more than it shows, inviting you deeper into it, to draw meaning. Like how some of Freddie's actions often draw smirks or even laughs, but if you pause to think about it, the weight of loneliness and frustrations behind his actions should, if anything, make one cry. Of course, pre-release, one of the film's most talked-about aspects was the fact that the character of Lancaster Dodd is based Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. The parallels between The Cause and Scientology are very clear; Anderson makes no attempt to mask it. So be it the past-life regression and the healing powers that Dodd attributes to it, the belief that man can cure his ailments in his current life by delving into his previous lives and curing him there, albeit mentally - all these and many more are all there. However, anyone expecting to find out the mystery behind what makes so many millions around the world follow Scientology as a religion is bound to be disappointed. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Freddie is one of the most gut-wrenching portrayals of a character in recent times. Perhaps Daniel Day Lewis did deserve his Best Actor Oscar for his performance as Lincoln, but some may say that the man had the added benefit of prosthetics as well as historical reference points to help him 'feel' more like the 16th President of the United State. But Joaquin Phoenix inhabits Freddie with the kind of body language and state of mind that had no reference point, and for that alone, he must be lauded. Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as Lancaster Dodd. A Paul Thomas Anderson staple, his filmography with Anderson alone shows the remarkable range that Hoffman has. It is tough to even imagine that the same guy who played Scotty in Boogie Nights has played Lancaster Dodd in The Master.Mihai Malaimare Jr's gorgeous cinematography and Johnny Greenwood's sparsely arranged but no-less haunting music embellish the sense of loneliness and the endless hunt for meaning that the film essentially is. Also, what a pity that we don't get a 70mm release for the film in India. The kind of detail that every 70mm frame would hold would perhaps give a little more insight into what Anderson is trying to say in every shot. Paul Thomas Anderson is an absolute master at taking the basest of human characteristics and weaving near-epic films out of them. He is also particularly skilled in making a film feel like it is lighter - so to speak - than it actually is. But with The Master, he goes more esoteric than he has ever done before; it asks more from a viewer than most viewers are used to giving to a film. Though many will disagree, I have long held the view that truly great cinema can only be appreciated on repeated viewings. Anyone who calls, for example, The Godfather, or Pulp Fiction, great films after watching them once has absolutely no idea why these films are great; they have to be watched repeatedly to see what true cinematic greatness is. Which is why The Master is the kind of film that will have polarized opinions. There will either be those who will reject the film in the first viewing, not wondering what the big deal is about, or there will be those who will feel like continuously revisiting it, attempting to draw more meaning with each subsequent viewing, then reading up on it and watching it again. They will continuously question themselves on what Dodd's intentions were, when it came to Freddy. Or when, exactly, did Dodd and Freddie first meet? Or was that a hint of homoeroticism they spotted in the relationship between Dodd and Freddie? Or what are Dodd's exact intentions with The Cause itself? And what, really, does the film even mean? If you are looking for it, the film always gives you the feeling that you've missed something. Likely then, that if you ask Anderson himself just what the film is about, he'll probably only say, ""Secrets.""]"
284,"[The mindset is such that you hear of the Boman Irani-Arshad Warsi combination and you expect a ""laugh out loud"" comedy. It doesn't help that the trailer points you in that direction too. It pleasantly surprises you, by starting off as satire, quirks and all. Then it takes a serious route, and even so, you are willing to play along because Jolly LLB seems like its trying to make an important point. Unfortunately at the end though, it is pretty disappointing.The disappointment is not as much because of the decision taken by the court, but due to lame defence (Boman Irani) and prosecution (Arshad Warsi). They seem rather clueless and caught unawares all the time. Sure, some benefit of doubt can be given under the name of character consistency. After all, the defence is callous, over-confident, arrogant and thus complacent. The prosecution is amateur and confused about his moral stand. It is also possible that we have beens spoilt by smart-Alec lawyers in our filmy courtrooms and real life lawyers are not really always on their toes. But, after this leeway too, the stage doesn't look convincing enough. If real-life is what we are aiming for, some things work out way too easily. Like a bribe drops down from 5 lakhs to 1 lakh without much back and forth. Or evidence is pointed towards, out of the blue. So on and so forth. And I sincerely hope lawyers and judges don't have shouting matches in real-world courtrooms.This overall inconsistency and ultimately flat drama pulls Jolly LLB down and takes a lot away from the satire it started out as. The pull towards gravity though meets constant resistance from the cast. How wonderfully subtle and underplayed both Boman Irani and Arshad Warsi can be when allowed to. No, over-the-top histrionics, characters played out as haughty and simple-minded respectively. Saurabh Shukla too gets a role weighty enough to play around with. While a caricature, his act as the twisted-but-straight-but-twisted judge is something you won't forget easily. His maneuvers over the defence are by themselves worth a watch - thorough 'babu' style. All of this with no help from the dialogue. A mockery of dialogue within the film by calling lines 'filmy', doesn't make it any less filmy. It makes the lines neither filmy enough to applaud nor real enough to be believable. Further distraction is caused by songs that don't belong. And why is this 'promotion' song during end credits becoming a norm?Jolly LLB feels like it was undecided between satire and drama. It looked like the heart was in the drama, but a few satirical moments came by and went through in the film. That didn't make the satire bad, it just made the film uneven and took the focus away from the story - which in itself was wrapped in drama that was neither dramatic nor real enough. ]"
285,"[Films which start out with a lie and then build up on that lie with more lies explode in a typical fashion and thus are predictable in that sense. Mere Dad Ki Maruti too, falls in that category, and doesn't get too creative with the lies either. However, some witty one-liners and that it gets a couple more lead characters involved in its lies keeps the going slightly more engaging than otherwise. That too though, goes missing in the last quarter of the film. The co-conspirators suddenly vanish for a while and reappear. We are to assume they were busy hatching alternate plans. Watching Sameer (Saqib Saleem) dig his grave deeper all by himself gets a little weary. His motivations seem dramatic and convoluted. This is saved, to a great extent, by some very sharp dialogue writing. Sameer who is constantly put down by his father and sister gets back at them in his own way, if only under his breath. However, like his friend (Prabal Punjabi) points out, he is way too casual about the supposedly alarming situation he is in. Such is his contribution in keeping things light. Saqib Saleem, Prabal Punjabi and Rhea Chakraborty together keep the film young with their SMSese. I didn't find all of that too amusing, felt a bit over-done. But, then again maybe I'm too old to find this funny. The dialogue delivery is too fast, maybe in keeping with the fast-paced lives that the young and restless live.  The other one-liners though are witty and come and go quickly, keeping the audience on its toes to stay with the flow. The Punjabi bit is a tad too in-the face. So is Ram Kapoor as Sameer's dad. It doesn't help that we have no clue why Sameer is being put down so bad by him, and his sister for that matter. All you hear is this putting-down and suddenly you are supposed to believe that 'it's all for the family' after all. In this family affair then, why-o-why did a cheap dance, performed by a bride, find place? If it is to exaggerate of how ridiculously offending lyrics find their way to family events, it is in bad taste. Such things with a quick anti-dowry pointer just don't gel together. Even so, Mere Dad Ki Maruti is a decent watch while you are at it. It gives you a couple hearty laughs and you smile more often than not. Oh and be prepared for an extra dose of Maruti advertisement in the first half hour. Then again, you were already warned, weren't you?]"
286,"[Except for the first few times that Neil Nitin Mukesh emotes fear, 3G has nothing going for it. The minimal good effects of that too are erased off, for what his character is made to do later in the film. From the basis of the scary supernatural to the ludicrous technical and metaphysical mumbo-jumbo, everything about 3G first makes you slap your palm to your forehead, then irritates and finally bores you with repetitions. There might be just a couple of occasions where you might look forward to something novel, but that dies down almost immediately.Just when you think the pace couldn't get any slower, you are thrown into a song with pretty much no rhyme or reason other than some gratuitous skin show. If at all the film managed to hook you for a bit, the question would haunt, ""Why aren't they leaving Fiji? The exotic location songs are done already?"" You get the drift, so let's keep this short. There must be better themes for horror lovers to make horror, no? ]"
287,"[What would a king be if it were not for his ego masked under his pride? Even when he shows care and tenderness, there is an air of, ""See, I can be nice."" The queens are helpless, assured about their helplessness and yet maintain their dignity with elegance and grace. Or at least try to. And they are all hurt, conniving, and devious when they want to be. Saheb, Biwi aur Gangster Returns etches its characters in much more detail than this broad stroke and is a huge step ahead of the first installment. Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster Returns is one of those rare thrillers, with double-crossing at its core, to get the balance right. This once, the motivations are more or less clear and the character transformations are digestible given the context of the film. Yet, the film doesn't lose out on its unpredictability. You know that pretty much each one of the main leads is capable of anything, especially if wronged, yet you are curious about their next move. At more than two junctures, a character is put in a wonderful dilemma. A dilemma that tests their loyalties and makes them question the loyalty of the person presenting the dilemma too. This is the most significant improvement over Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster, aided by the fact that sex isn't the only symbol of being in love. Unfortunately, some of these dilemmas don't see a proper conclusion. They are sort-of left hanging in the air.Another distraction was the ambiance. Surely, the film had a majestic air about it. But that is only because of the performances, the language used - aristocracy oozing out of words. The rest of the setting, the background music, the production design were far removed from being royal. Yes, the palaces are supposed to be dilapidated. But some inconsistencies throw you off, like a run-down palace has a modern, expensive shower head, in the bathroom. On the other hand a Polo sequence takes you to an atmosphere far away from where you are, into their world, into poised men and women who'd cross any limits to honor what they believe to be their heritage. But you don't stay their through the film, even for scenes that are set in palaces. For example, a wailing baby in the background seems completely out of place.Also, out of place are some decisions. Did we really need an item number? Even worse, did we need a Raj Babbar to be comic relief in the said song? And how much of a sore thumb is the 'returns' in the title?!If you let that be though, the lead characters are lovely shades of grey. Even if Mahie Gill didn't play it out well, her Madhavi wants it all with minimum effort is the most intriguing. Soha Ali Khan's Ranjana might be the lightest shade of grey, but some events in life do bring out the worst in you, don't they? These women are not the strongest ones around, but they somehow manage to stay on top. Of the cast, Mahie Gill sticks out as over-the-top. Right, she is the sex-deprived unsuccessful seductress, who finds her way out through a drink and another, but she is extremely unconvincing. Especially amidst other wonder lead performances. Both Jimmy Shergill and Soha Ali Khan have a screen presence befitting their characters' ancestry. Jimmy Shergill more than Soha Ali Khan. Irrfan Khan as the only one fighting for his family's honor is as goofy and likable as he always is.Just for these performances and some sharp dialogue laced around obviously film-y lines, Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster Returns is a decent watch. Add to that well-written lead characters and it becomes a must watch that can make you let the follies be. ]"
288,"[~ ~ ~ Update ~ ~ ~I happened to catch Django Unchained on DVD and here's an update on the DVD features. Here's the thing; just like how the release of a new Quentin Tarantino movie is an event, the DVD of a Quentin Tarantino film is a collectible, no matter what. That's why it surprises me when DVDs of his films are always designed and packed just like any other.No matter, because Django Unchained is a great film to have in your DVD collection. The pack contains just the one DVD, which has both the film as well as the special features on it. The main special feature is titled 'Remembering J. Michael Riva: The Production Design of Django Unchained', a 12 minute piece that looks back fondly at the film's production designer, who died while the film was being shot. Though a nice piece in itself, it disappoints slightly because it's strange to talk about a film's production design and not have the director and cinematographer make even a cursory appearance to talk about it.The other two items in the list of special features are promos for a Quentin Tarantino Blu-Ray pack of 8 films and for the OST of Django Unchained, respectively. Nothing much to shout about, but the promo of the QT Blu-Ray pack excites you with the promise of having over 5 hours of never-before-seen footage. Other features on the DVD include the options of having Hindi, Tamil &amp; Telugu subtitles.Like every Tarantino film, Django Unchained gets better with each viewing as well. So, really, cinephiles just absolutely must have a copy of this one either way.~ ~ ~ Original Review ~ ~ ~At the outset, I must confess that I am the biggest Tarantino-phile that you'll meet. I've watched every one of his films more times than I can count and I have marveled, laughed, ogled and dropped my jaw at his films more times than most people have even said his name. In short, I'd like to believe that I am to Quentin Tarantino what Joss Whedon is to comic books. Or there and thereabouts.Needless to say, Django Unchained has been the film I've waited for the most, for about two years now. When I finally watched the film on the big screen, it delivered exactly what it promised - cheeky, irreverent, violent, indulgent fun that you might either love or abhor, but you just can't ignore. Set in the American Deep South a few years before the Civil War, Dr. King Schultz is a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter, who is on the lookout for a slave named Django who, he believes, can point him into three of his targets. What begins as a business relationship between a former slave and bounty hunter then turns into a joint hunt for Django's wife, who he was separated from when they were sold.While Django Unchained certainly isn't Tarantino's best film to date - it isn't nearly as outlandishly entertaining as Inglourious Basterds or as narratively clever as Pulp Fiction - there is still a whole lot of fun to be had with it. Politically incorrect as always (the dangerous 'N' word is used even more than the 'F' word), with unapologetically gory violence in abundance (but my, how beautifully the gun battles have been choreographed!) and zany characters that will charm you irrespective of which side of the moral spectrum they stand, Tarantino writes and directs what is essentially a Western (or a Southern, as he likes to call it) with flourish. Unmistakably though, Django Unchained does struggle sometimes as a film; one of the big reasons for this, I suspect, is the fact his long-time collaborator and editor, Sally Menke, passed away in 2010. Menke edited every one of his films from Reservoir Dogs to Inglourious Basterds, perhaps making her the person who understood Tarantino the director, and more importantly, Tarantino the writer more than anyone. Django has been edited by her erstwhile assistant Fred Raskin, but he doesn't nearly seem to show the kind of understanding of Tarantino's style that Menke did. Something that I sorely missed was that one great, long, slowly unpeeling conversation piece that gently builds nerve-wracking tension until it reaches a nail-biting crescendo, before exploding into what is usually violent climax. This, I'm sure, has as much to do with the editing as the writing. Strangely enough, stripping away its genre exterior, the satirical take on slavery and usual Tarantino-isms, the film is also partly something that he has never really made so far, a love story. That perhaps, is also one of the reasons why Django Unchained may disappoint some; perhaps love stories aren't his thing to begin with. Also, at 2 hours and 45 minutes, there will surely be those who'll find the runtime a tad too long. Then of course, there are his usual liberties, those taken with as much conscious effort as the bits of genius. So even a nighttime scene in the midst of a dense forest is lit fairly high key, the source of light becoming a question mark if you pause to ponder over it. Another frequent Tarantino collaborator, cinematographer Robert Richardson (who, incidentally, also frequently collaborates with Martin Scorsese) lights Django Unchained creating some truly gorgeous frames out of the most mundane visuals. He also uses exaggerated zooms often; something fastidiously avoided by most filmmakers, because it often looks amateurish. In Tarantino's &amp; Richardson's hands, however, they only do what they were intended to do - draw instant attention to characters, expressions and situations. Django Unchained, then, becomes fun primarily because of the characters and the cast that essays them. Jamie Foxx as Django is superb. Watch his character gradually change from being a confused slave to a confident free man, as he gets used to the idea of no longer being bonded. Tarantino seems to have made a habit out of writing Christoph Waltz into Academy Award-winning roles, and with good reason. He is expectedly excellent as the articulate and immaculate German former-dentist, Dr. Schultz. Samuel Jackson and Leonardo DiCaprio have largely been ignored at the awards season this year, and I fail to understand why. Separated only by skin colour but one no less devious than the other, their characters bring a new spin to 'negative', and the two perform immensely well. They were, for me, the pick of the cast.What separates Tarantino from most other filmmakers isn't the fact that he is a fine screenwriter as well as a director. Each of these facets of his cinematic craft has a distinct voice, which explains why he confidently puts out the completed scripts of his films online well before they are released and why those scripts invariably make for great reads without later ruining the experience of watching the film; his films, after all, exist in an entirely different universe altogether - an elevated movie universe with its own rules. And therein lies my big concern with Django Unchained.Tarantino has so far made two kinds of movies - his 'real' movies like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and his exaggerated-universe ones like Kill Bill and Inglourious Basterds. One can imagine the latter two to be movies that exist in the universe of the characters from the former two. Thus, one can imagine Larry Dimmick from Reservoir Dogs going to watch a WWII flick called  Inglourious Basterds in the cinemas. Django Unchained, while tilting slightly towards the latter category, isn't an obvious outright fit there, if you try to explore it further. Thus, even though I maintain that Django Unchained is mostly a delight, when compared with the sheer audacity of some of his earlier filmography, the 'de' is often silent.]"
289,"[Economics. Demand and supply. Beautiful things and their assumptions corrupted by the greedy and power-hungry. The brunt of course is borne by the common man. The man who has to skim on his outgoing calls and manipulate others to spend less himself. The woman who has to cut corners on grooming herself to make ends meet. Though our situation might not be as extreme as that of Puttanpal (Sanjay Mishra), we can extrapolate his concerns to ours without having to stretch our imagination too much. Unfortunately, despite having this to its advantage, you lose interest in Saare Jahaan Se Mehenga quite quickly.Without a doubt the seed of Saare Jahaan Se Mehenga is a brilliant one. Also, there are some details, often exaggerated to accentuate the satire, that are very earthy. Interestingly, the exaggeration too is carried out in a very matter-of-fact manner and makes it humorous. But, none of this lasts and the situation stays flat. Same thing goes for the characters. From the caustic dad to the supporting wife to the full-of-attitude brother to the frustrated common man himself, characters are interesting with a lovely shade of reality. But they don't engage beyond. I guess that's the price you pay for writing consistent characters. But even consistent characters need an arc to make a story.The performances and dialogue put together try their best to keep Saare Jahaan Se Mehenga afloat. But can manage to just about barely do that. The supporting characters take away a lot of credibility.Yet, Saare Jahaan Se Mehenga is not a complete write-off because of what it tries to do. It tries its best to bring out the frustration of the lower-middle class. The use of satire stays in the background yet makes its point - from the obvious one on soaring prices of basic necessities to the joke that 'being of age', being 18 is in an Indian family. If only, it had not given into having a preachy, lackluster turn around towards the climax. Oh well, maybe next time. ]"
290,"[It is touching. It is sweet. The romance is too good to be true. Yet at some level it works, because the chemistry works. But, where's the ""hum"" Mr.Devgan? I saw only the ""U"". Why is the Mrs. denied character development? Of course, the U can argue that the movie is from Ajay's point of view. But then why behave like you are in love with cheese and call it, U Me Aur Hum?The story has a clear set-up, a conflict and a resolution. I like the pace at which the romance builds on the cruise ship as a tribute to Titanic. The conflict chosen however, is so specific that you wonder whether the resolution is applicable to all situations. Especially considering that Ajay Devgan, as a person, wants people to work on their relationships rather than let go.  Yet, it does manage to make you think ""how much would I be willing to give up in my relationship?""Again, the problem at hand is specific enough to warrant research. A cursory glance around the web raises a couple questions. To an extent, the movie is not about this specific issues, but is about the overall idea that love also means enjoying the blindness. But the issue is so much at the crux of the story that it can't be ignored.And why this obsession with a boy child? ""To each his own"" is all very good, but do we really need that kind of propaganda in such an influential medium? The issue of female infanticide is so rampant in India that this one doesn't even need research.Coming back to the romance, there is a lot of pretentious dialogue going back and forth, which is alright till Ashwani Dhir gets to sentences with ""repeated words"". He takes this scheme of sentence formation along with a joke to the other release this week Krazzy 4 too. So, we are repeating across movies too! Not to mentions that some of the key scenes lacked punch. But, there is this particular monologue which is getting tedious just when Ajay changes his tone completely and takes off. It touches the right chord. Yeah, the credit does go to Ajay Devgan for that. I have always felt that it's very difficult for a director to direct himself well. But when it comes to directing others, Ajay missed the mark. Almost everyone in the supporting cast is over-the-top. Of course, Kajol has done the best she can to get us involved with her situation despite the lack of depth writer, Ajay Devgan, etches out for her. Though she does get to her shrill self every once in a while. But I'm still miffed by the short hand she has been dealt.More credit to Ajay, this time with regard to experimenting with the camera. And of course to Aseem Bajaj for executing the director's vision. Most of the film is shot with the subject of the camera in the background. And some or the other out-of-focus object in the foreground - be it a chair, a person or a showpiece lying on the table that the subject is sitting behind. I found this interesting because I always had some inkling as to the evironment the character in focus is in.However, while Ajay and Kajol are stylish, elegant personalities, they are not the most beautiful looking people. Close-ups of their aging faces should be avoided, especially when they are playing characters 10 years younger than they are.Munna Dhiman does a decent job with the lyrics. The witty words flow well with the music and thus you don't have to strain too hard to understand. The music however, is just about functional. Despite all its flaws, U Me Aur Hum touches a tender spot, makes a tear roll, and sets you thinking about what love really means to you.]"
291,"[There is no dearth of morons in this world, and clearly, there is a whole genre of films that tries to show how much fun it is to have a laugh at a moron's expense. 21 &amp; Over has its fair share of moronic characters, but is a consistently unfunny film packed with gags that were outdated this time last century. An exhausting comedy that tries its best to channel similar films in the genre - The Hangover, Superbad, American Pie and the likes - but failing quite miserably, 21 &amp; Over is the kind of film that makes 93 minutes seem like an eternity. Surprisingly enough, the film is written by and is the debut directorial effort of the writers of The Hangover, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. Jeff Chang has just turned 21, and his oldest buddies - the obnoxiously in-your-face Miller and the nerdy aspiring-Wall-Street-guy Casey - land up at his doorstep after years being out of touch, to take him pub-hopping and to generally show him a good time. Except that Jeff Chang has a career-defining interview the very next morning, and his father is in absolutely no mood to let him do anything that would jeopardize his interview and his career. Not that anything is going to stop Jeff Chang's friends, Miller in particular, from having their way. Then begins a night of migraine-inducing silliness that never seems to end.Apart from a few moments in the film that you can't help be amused by, the film is very clearly trying too hard. True, Miles Teller, Skylar Astin and Justin Chon - who play Miller, Casey and Jeff Chang respectively - manage to keep their energy levels consistently high. But there is only so much that an enthusiastic cast can do, when the writer-directors are finding it so hard to rise above banality. The film primarily relies on stereotypes and racism to be funny, with booze, puke and nudity being their second line of attack. Unsurprisingly, none of these works.Packing proceedings with everything, from an irritable group of jocks, annoying sorority girls, a hairy, semi-nude, self-proclaimed Master of something that I don't remember, to a nut-job wearing an Indian chief's headdress, the film tests your patience throughout. And with a feeble attempt at being a coming-of-age story as well, where the film tries to tell you that you should follow your heart and do what makes you happy, the film manages to lose a plot that it never had in the first place. One would think that an hour and a half isn't too much to take, but believe you me, this film feels way longer than that. It doesn't help that even technically, the film is quite weak. It has an all-too-generic look about it and has some choppy editing, though I strongly suspect some of it is because of abrupt cuts suggested by the Indian censors. Fact remains that in a poor film, weak technique stands out even more, something that this film suffers from as well. Predictable, asinine and always puerile, 21 &amp; Over is truly a film that just doesn't need to be watched. For silliness that invokes some genuine laughs, I'd suggest you just revisit The Hangover on DVD instead.]"
292,"[The first effect that Triumph Of The Will produced on me, was to make me temporarily forget Adolf Hitler's crimes, by simply bowling me over with his oratory skills through the speeches that this documentary is full of. Indeed, there is no other speaker the world has seen, who can not crack you up in that silly moustache, and yet mobilize an entire nation to act as per his command.The second effect: An immense admiration for the film's female director, Leni Riefenstahl (pronounced Ree-fen-staal) who was commissioned by Hitler himself to make this film.Triumph Of The Will documents Hitler's visit to Nuremberg to attend the Nazi Party Congress, and the manner in which Riefenstahl has captured the grandeur of that visit, is very wow-worthy. Not just in scale, but also in her employment of camera technique and aesthetics - stuff which perhaps only a woman's eye can uniquely observe. I say this, because she succeeds in making Hitler not only handsome, but someone who looks to be in charge of his people.Right from the introductory scenes where Hitler's aircraft floats through the clouds, to its shadow passing over the streets of Nuremberg like a blessing, to his descent and eventual appearance in front of his supporters - it feels as if God himself emerged from the doors of the plane. Riefenstahl does well to hold your attention right upfront. Just when you think that this may turn out to be yet another film filled with grainy, fast-forward worthy footage from history, you're surprised to see how well-preserved the material still is (a big pat on the back of Enlighten Film Society for making this available in India).Riefenstahl's crew shot the four-day Congress and in the process, collected over 60 hours of footage. The 109 minutes that you finally see in this film are a mix of Hitler's speeches made on each day, the Republic Day-kinda parade presented for him displaying the might of the German artillery and Youth Army. There are some rare moments too: you spot Hitler smile once in a while and also witness him getting humbled by the support.His speeches are undoubtedly fiery and the manner in which they've been shot, is nothing short of an Obama address. He is often erected on a podium high up in the air, and resulting effect seems to resemble a religious address from the Pope. Hitler however, speaks without any reference material in front of him. He talks right from the heart and with so much passion, you fear his moustache might explode into bits, or his teeth might crunch to pieces. His comments are highly provocative, prejudiced, but his sense of patriotism is unique, almost equating it as a religion of sorts. Throughout the film, the camera does a fine job of capturing people's reactions, through tight close-ups - be it of the Youth Army poised in attention, or the little kids playing the drums for the band like there was no tomorrow. A chill ran down my spine thinking that all those kids and young men would be dead by now.This film is an accomplishment in cinematic technique, for managing to pull off a grand event of this nature - that too by a woman film-maker in what was then, a man's world. The agile camera movements, the tight tracking frames of Hitler, the obsession with finding textures in the sea of army men walking in discipline, the low-angle shots providing Hitler a Godly halo - all of them tie in well together and give enough justification as to why this is one of the greatest propaganda films of all time.Leni Reifenstahl, an actress herself, made this film on Hitler's request. Although skeptical at the beginning,  since she didn't understand the importance of Hitler's visit and the visit's political implications, she agreed only when the Fuhrer, a self-confessed admirer of her work, convinced her that he wanted an artistic viewpoint in shooting the proceedings. In hindsight, it seems like a great decision, but it proved detrimental for the advancement of Riefenstahl's career. She came to known as a Nazi pin-up girl and despite she breaking new ground in filming technique with every film, critics always ended up pointing out fascist tendencies in her work.Which is why, Triumph Of The Will is a significant film in the course of cinematic history. It covers up Hitler's crimes so well, sealing once and for all, the ritual of German worship of their great dictator. But it also dug a coffin for its extremely talented film-maker, who is today credited for inventing and enhancing innovations like underwater photography.Parts of the film are certain to bore you - like the never-ending parades and the on-going orchestra, which forms the background score. But watching Hitler at the microphone is a weird experience - its a mix of amusement, admiration and hatred. That's a feeling few men in the world can generate.]"
293,"[""What...are these people? What kind of hatred...is this?"" Jt Commissioner Maria (Nana Patekar) is as baffled by the inconceivable ruthlessness of the 26/11 attacks as we were on 26 November, 2008. In another scene he's seeking help from the Central Government while the attacks are on, and his helplessness comes through with an exasperated, ""I don't know what to do."" The thought behind these two sentences reverberate within, even before they have been said out loud. The large space between these lines is what makes any terrorist attack what it is. Its attempt to address these lines is what makes The Attacks of 26/11 a movie worth watching. Unprepared, untrained, unequipped - that's how any police force would be when facing a terror attack of this nature. It's not that nothing should be done to prepare, train and equip ourselves better, but an attack without any tip, is bound to catch local law enforcement off-guard - people walking around with limitless ammunition, willing to kill or die. Just like when an airplane crashes into a building or several cases of serial bombing. The first half numbs you with episodes of the 26/11 attacks one after another. In this half though, weird camera angles, ridiculous focus on various statues (Laughing Buddha being the favorite!), loud screeching violins in the background - all annoy and distract. But the content is so close to home that you can mostly ignore them. The body count too seems exaggerated, be it at CST station or at the Taj Hotel (even if the film uses the Taj lobby as a symbol of all who died or were injured in all other places on that day.) But, throughout you make small connects with people who you could care for - children of course, but police officers and regular by-standers. The connect is obviously because it could have been you or me or someone we know. And Ram Gopal Verma appropriately cashes in on this connect, even if with little finesse. Whether or not the film would be more human, more engaging, if in the hands of another director - I don't want to know. In fact, that issue remains throughout. Am I connecting with the film because of the characters and how the film is narrated or is it inherent with my connect to the incident itself? Unfortunately, this is something I will never be able to answer. And this will work in the film's favor forever. Also, I am sure there are many unsung heroes in this incident that didn't make their way into the film. Surely, there are many changes and additions to the events to provide for that bit of drama needed to make a story into a film. Way too many times in the first half, you wonder, ""How do they know that happened?"" because everyone involved died. Also, the film covers only the events of 26/11 and not the two days after. Yet, that is the cinematic liberty we can allow to a maker who is trying to go beyond just the occurrences of this one event. The second half has two main scenes which bring about a balance that I didn't think a film on this event could bring about. It would be safe to say that we as a nation are not in the mood to understand the psyche of the terrorist who has the audacity of holding one of our cities at ransom. So, to try to bring about a sermon setting the right from the wrong might be considered a cop-out or brave; filmy or wise - depending on what your stand is. Surprisingly, I found myself in awe of (lapping up) Jt Commissioner Maria's word-for-word, thought-for-thought, concept-for-concept response in his spiel. All credit to some awesome dialogue writing and an overpowering dialogue delivery. Not to mention, the thought behind the said monologue, resonates with my attitude towards any strong religious sentiment used out of context and as a justification for hideous acts. Someone said it out loud. It doesn't matter then whether or not the Jt Commissioner actually had such a conversation in real life. Here the director is talking to us, the citizens of this country. And maybe he hopes to reach out to the oddball Jihadi who ends up watching his film. And if that does happen, the manner in which it is done reaches the viewer's gut and Nana Patekar's performance in that one scene could be enough to warrant a watch. What a relief it is to see him not resort to his typical style, but take a more restrained route. Even without the monologue, one shot where he is offered water shows you he needs no histrionics for a good performance. Here, the close-ups are used brilliantly.Sanjeev Jaiswal as Kasab induces enough hatred to not want to watch him in any other film again. Then again, that is more because the character is not fictional. Only a few more films will determine whether or not he is a good actor. For now, that the audience was restless whenever he was on screen and abused strongly shows that he didn't goof up.Despite all that was good about the film, it is difficult to shake off the disgust felt when I heard that director, Ram Gopal Verma had visited the site of the attacks the day after. Insensitive of him, irresponsible of the people who allowed it to happen. The negativity that his visit had brought about, will stay forever and will always be a black mark against his product. Yet, such films are important. If not to remind us of the difference between the fundamentals of religion and being a fundamentalist, to remind us of questions we should not stop asking our resilient selves, ""Are our shores secure today?""]"
294,"[It's bad enough that life has its share of people who can't stop talking about themselves and how cool they are. Why would I want to watch these characters on screen? Especially when they are being superficial about being full of themselves. I, Me Aur Main is too plain vanilla a story despite being different in that it is modern in its take on relationships, at least in a very broad stroke. It suffers from the usual complaint of not having a single character who you can root for. Even though there is Anushka (Chitrangda Singh) who is obviously in the right, you don't know enough about her to root for her. It doesn't help that Chitrangda Singh is getting worse at emoting with every film. Wide eyes and pointed lips make for a lovely face to look at, but they don't once convince you about anything they are saying. Especially, with a put-on accent that makes the entire act seem even more fake. Prachi Desai on the other hand is vibrant and you want to know her character, Gauri more. But, of course, you aren't let in except for the token scenes featuring her flamboyant and confident nature.  John Abraham plays his wooden self, except for a couple of scenes where he makes you really believe how oblivious he is to other people's existence, his character, Ishaan is. The situations themselves are hardly connected. They are a series of supposedly fun and not-so-fun events stringed together. Yet, there are a couple of scenes that are done well. I especially liked the awkward moment created for Anushka at Ishaan's sister's house. Thematically, the modern solution found by a couple who doesn't get along with each other but wants to be together for one reason or other is pretty mature, especially when found in a film that has not much mature about it otherwise. It is almost like the writer hit upon this idea he wanted to convey and worked backwards to form a story towards that end.Another aspect of today's life that I, Me Aur Main touches upon is the mandatory relationship that the 60+ generation finds itself in. This is a generation who doesn't see separation or divorce as an option. This is a generation that hasn't necessarily experienced love in the romantic sense of the word. I understand I, Me Aur Main is hardly about this facet of life, but since it broached the subject, I would have loved to see more of it.Another interesting decision in terms of film-making was the one of having just the one lip-sync song. Considering Ishaan is a producer of singing stars, there was certainly room for more. Yet, the lack of songs is not sufficient either to make a good film now, is it?With quite a few, small things going in the right direction for I, Me Aur Main, the film in its entirety still feels like too shallow a take at relationships. Quite in sync with its title protagonist, but not good enough a metaphor to take it through being even a half-decent watch. ]"
295,"[Those who've watched Zero Dark Thirty or Homeland will be familiar with a torture technique that involves not letting captive prisoners sleep by playing loud, noisy music and shining bright lights on them at all times. I'd only be slightly exaggerating if I said that they could just have put them in a theatre playing A Good Day to Die Hard instead.Nearly a quarter of a century after Bruce Willis' John McClane first scorched the big screen with unflinching, deadpan badass-ery, the aged but still cheerful action superstar returns in the fifth installment of the series; one that should have ended with the previous film. Directed by John Moore, the film is set in Russia this time, where John McClane has come in pursuit of his estranged son who is in the custody of the authorities there. However, he quite soon discovers that his son isn't your usual vagabond imprisoned by the Commies - about then, I think that there might just be a feeble attempt at a story. All hopes of that evaporate soon after, however, as the Father-Son McClane duo spend the rest of their screen time bringing Russia to rubble all by themselves, with the customary few scratches to their own bodies. Loosely put, Taken with a yippee-ki-yay touch, with a pointless background story of what seems like a domestic quarrel between rich and powerful Russian men.If the sorry excuse for a plot makes you grimace, the execution of the film is nothing less than an assault on the senses. Humans, vehicles, buildings and even public infrastructure are treated with the same amount of disdain by the trigger-happy McClanes, who don't for a second seem to think discretion is an option. After all, why waste time thinking, when you can blow something up? Admittedly, the high-octane camera work had me for about the first 20 minutes, before I realized that the octane level didn't ever intend to dip. After that, it was all about trying to out-think the writer and director in terms of how ludicrous they could get. What is good to see though is that Bruce Willis hasn't gotten over his penchant for having fun while the world is crumbling around him, with or without his interference. He adds a cutesy comic touch to John McClane's paternal instincts, as he straddles the line between being a father looking out for his son and being the original bad guy hunter. Jai Courtney, who plays McClane's son Jack, hasn't a friction of the screen presence or likeability of Willis. He is bland with emotion as well as humour, which makes the father-and-son reconciliation aspect of the film seem like a bit of a joke. A Good Day To Die Hard is a tedious watch, because the film never eases up on the action, fully testing the limits of your suspension of disbelief. If there is anything good about the film at all, it is that it may make fans of the original films go back and revisit them, just for some good old-fashioned action fun. The only people who might find the film watchable are those who are absolute hard-core and exclusive action film fans, but for whom Chulbul Pandey is a bit too low-brow. ]"
296,"[Zila Ghaziabad is a revenge drama that never should've been made. Just like Jayantabhai Ki Luv Story was a romance that never should've been made. Without an ounce of originality Zila Ghaziabad just seems like someone's fetish of watching two hours worth of action. Amidst this free-for-all shootout, it was hilarious then to see a bone being picked because a few of the goons wore fake police uniforms while shooting. Huh? That was the only objection that the keepers of law and order had? Other than that, there are maybe four or atmost five one-liners that might bring smiles, two of which would be innuendos. Almost every frame reeks of drama. And drama almost always means either loud background score or slow motion that goes on for a little more than would be needed to make the drama effective. But hey, what can you say, for this is a world where slo-mo defines the character who is  in focus - If he's being recorded in slo-mo means he is important, means along with other characters in the film, we should fear him.That is as deep as the writing goes. The three male leads could take each others' place or character and you wouldn't know. The women, calling them props would mean they had some significance in the film. Unless their role as being the one who is shot/kidnapped to get at another man, implies they have meaning in the life of the men or the film. With such a background then, do the men need to emote at all. And even if they try would it come across as anything but fake. Even so, you can see Paresh Rawal, Arshad Warsi and Ravi Kisen at least try. Sanjay Dutt and Vivek Oberoi on the other hand try to hard. The only interesting character then seems to be Fakeera (Sunil Grover) who plays Shakuni Mama in this supposed replay of Mahabharat. Just in case you miss the Mahabharat analogy you have a loud 'yada yada hi dharmasya' playing when Pritam Singh (Sajay Dutt) is in action. It's a different matter that any two sides waging war against each other with a cunning character could mean its trying to depict Mahabharat. So, to give that one a break you have Sanjay Dutt staring at a chess board and after much contemplation moving a pawn on the board as a first move! It doesn't end here, later you have two kings facing each other, two steps away from each other. Item numbers - two not one, cheesy one-liners, self-referencing jokes that's what makes up for the parts of  Zila Ghaziabad that aren't action. The action sequences itself are tedious almost in competition with the tiring drama. ]"
297,"[It's been a while since I thought a movie needed to be a little longer. Not necessarily because I was having a very good time or was thoroughly engaged, but because I wanted to see more of each of the characters. Every time I was involved with them, I was moved on to the next episode. No emotion was allowed to sink in. Yet, what the story is trying to convey, and the performances make for a certain one-time watch - if not in theaters, at least when it is out on DVD/TV.It is very likely that my need to know more about the characters springs from having found them interesting in the book, 3 Mistakes of My Life by Chetan Bhagat. The book has a little more about each of them, especially the side characters. On the other hand, they weren't well-fleshed out to start with either. So cutting out from what was already little felt rather sketchy.It was quite an ordeal finishing the book, but that's mainly because the language is too plain-speak. His words can get tiring with their lack of flow. (It doesn't help that I took it upon myself to read the book again before watching the film.) Yet, I admit, Chetan Bhagat does have interesting stories to tell, even if they are outlandish and superficial, the basic concepts are capable of holding interest.It's a good thing then that film-making has grammar of its own and Abhishek Kapoor makes the narrative interesting enough to make two hours pass by in almost a blink. With so many themes that are so close to home for most of us, it is easy to hook us in - friendship of course, communal riots and cricket! Only thing missing here is Bollywood. With these themes as broad strokes, the director manages to get quite a bit of detail in his frames. The camera work is almost always jittery, not letting you settle in, in any one atmosphere, be it the romance between Govind (Raj Kumar Yadav) and Vidya (Amrita Puri) or Ishaan's (Sushant Singh Rajput) struggle with his adamant student Ali (Digvijay Deshmukh) or Omi's unsure personality being moulded into what his uncle (Manav Kaul) stands for. What keeps the film together, with its fluidity, though is the background score. It is lilting, melodious and subtle all at once.And of course, the performances are the glue too. Ace-rate performances by one and all make Kai Po Che worth the time, effort and money, by themselves. Each of their passions shone through be it business, cricket or politics. Their friendship worked too. Yet, I would now really like to see Raj Kumar Yadav in a role where he needs to speak slower, just so we know he can do it. Sushant Singh Rajput is refreshing and Amit Sadh has a screen presence without speaking much. I found, casting of Manav Kaul as the communal leader, the most surprising - younger and more polished than I'd have imagined the character. But, he fit in just right. Given the material they had, the tweaks the screenplay writers made, makes Kai Po Che really interesting. But, like with any film that is based on a book you've read, it is very difficult to shake the book off while watching it. There maybe debates (a few of which I heard on my way out of the theater) about what was added/deleted/edited from the book and whether or not that worked for the film. But as it stands by itself, the movie works because of the audience relates with the content. Only it felt like it was incomplete because it didn't delve deeper into each of the themes.Also, like with the book, the story starts out with friendship and its hardships and abruptly ends up becoming a larger national issue. But then again, isn't that pretty much what life is like? All dynamics change abruptly when a calamity hits you personally.Ultimately for me, the clincher was seeing a 600-seater full-house in a 'star'-struck nation for a film that doesn't sport any stars. Even the director isn't that big-ticket a name. Which means that people came either for the story they read or the trailers they saw. And I wasn't even surprised. This is a HUGE step. ]"
298,"[All of us are crazy, in some way or the other. As much as we'd like to pretend that we are sane while some others are not, there's no escaping the fact that there is something inside every single person on the face of the earth that makes them weird, insane, and at times, downright neurotic. Each of us is a square block trying our best to fit into a round hole. In the charming little world created by David O. Russell in Silver Linings Playbook, a host of dysfunctional characters deal with their own little insanities in their everyday life, while coming to terms with loss, friendship and love. Far from being a typical romantic comedy, the film is a warm ride of smile-inducing moments and characters that you can't help but fall in love with. We peek into their lives, walk with them a while and then leave them, knowing that they'll continue with their madness; after all, we were only incidental spectators. We are immediately introduced to Pat, who has spent the last eight months in a psychiatric facility in Baltimore, for reasons explained a little later in the film. His mother signs him out and takes him back home to Philadelphia, so that he can get on with bringing normalcy back into his life. But then that is precisely what the film deals with; what exactly is 'normal'? Pat, a married man, gets on with the task of setting things right with his life and his estranged wife, when he meets Tiffany, a recently-widowed woman who has her own issues. Together, they set about helping each other deal with the mess in their respective lives. The first, instant connect that one makes with the film is the manner in which the characters speak to each other; it seems real, because in real life, rarely do people talk in full sentences when in conversation. We often cut each other off, we often speak simultaneously and we almost often talk more than we listen. The writing, direction and the performances work so beautifully together to achieve this effect of the characters conversing how people do in real life. Also, every character has their own little lunacy that finds resonance within you on some level. So there's Pat's obsessive-compulsive father who is superstitious about the presence or absence of objects and people while watching a football game. Then there's his mate from the psychiatric hospital who can only talk about his hair; and so many others, each of whom you can't help but adore.What I really liked about the film is the fact that you always know where it is going, but that doesn't stop the film from surprising you throughout. It thrives on the simple principle that the journey matters more than the destination; how you get to the end matters more than the end itself. So, even if the story isn't novel in any way, the screenplay is tinged with humour in everyday lines and events, with the odd outlandish situation that will make you smile wide.My only real problems with the film were largely technical - minor directorial oversights like some suspect choice of shot framing, particularly in long dialogue scenes, as well as frequent axis jumps. Axis jumps are fine as long as they don't ruin the illusion of continuity, but they often do so in this film. Also, I often got the feeling that a number of the dialogues and scenes were far longer, but were cut short - a call taken at the edit stage, I suspect. The plethora of nominations and wins that the cast of the film has garnered comes as no surprise; every single one of them is outstanding. Bradley Cooper has always had a likeable, charming presence on screen. But his turn as Pat comes as a huge surprise. He manages to capture every little beat of his character's quirks so beautifully that it blows you away. The gorgeous Jennifer Lawrence, best known for her role as Katniss Evergreen in The Hunger Games, manages to spring a wonderful performance as Tiffany. Tiffany is, if possible, an even crazier character than Pat, and Lawrence completely wins your heart with her performance. I didn't know that she had it in her to turn out such a mature performance at such a young age. I was glad to see one of my favourite actors, Robert De Niro, back in form after such a long time. After a slew of indifferent characters that he has played lately, he finally sinks his teeth into the heartwarming character of Pat's father. Jacki Weaver plays Pat's mother; she expresses more with her eyes than through her words, and she does a wonderful job as well. One of my other favourite actors, our very own Anupam Kher, plays Pat's psychiatrist in the film. He has a small role, but is a joy to watch. Also, what a relief to finally not have an Indian actor speak with a silly accent in a Hollywood film. No one buys an old-fashioned romantic comedy anymore, because both, the romance and the comedy, are invariably cranked up beyond necessary. Silver Linings Playbook is a new age romantic comedy, one where the romance and comedy are far more real and identifiable. It is a film with heart as well as a sense of humour, and both of them are bound to charm you. Watch the film; there is a good chance that you'll be smiling throughout, and that you'll leave the cinema smiling.]"
299,"[You wait for the thrills and shrills to begin. You wait and you wait and you wait. Finally, an hour and a half later, you don't get the shreiks alright - thank goodness for some mercies - but you get a very interesting premise to hook you in. Too late? May be. Too little? May be.Just way too much time is spent on establishing a flaky love affair. You don't know why one has fallen in love with another or why stays in love either. Given the number of things to cause mistrust the love should've have fallen apart a couple of days into the relationship. Anyway, so, much-too-much love happens in South Africa, Goa, Mumbai and I'm sure a few other exotic locations. There is an air of mystery but as an experienced audience you have an inkling it's misleading. When, the real mystery is unveiled, you sit up. A world of possibilities opens up. A lot of test-of-character is bound to occur. These opportunities are utilized well too.The question then is whether or not you can forgive the time spent in getting there. Here, you should be warned that even the events of the last half hour are a tad predictable. Not necessarily because you are a step ahead of the makers or have seen it before, but because you are given that extra thirty seconds to guess what will happen next. And you are more likely than not going to guess right. Aditi Rao Hydari's performance too makes things engaging. I just hope she gets a role soon, that can use the talent she seems to have. Randeep Hooda and Sara Loren carry typical plastic expressions I associate with this genre of horror/thrillers produced. Randeep a little less than Sara, because of Sara's drone-like dialogue delivery. The background music tries hard to create spook and fails.  The camera doesn't try to pull anything outside the box. The songs are like any other recent product from the Bhatt factory. Why are the makers not willing to let go of these cliches? Why is it so difficult to go beyond? Especially when they have willingly accepted that they are drawing from another film - La cara oculta, Spanish this time.You cannot but help think - given a combination of a woman's instinct and her insecurity and a physical atmosphere of claustrophobia, Murder 3 ought to have arrested us. ]"
300,"[It has been a while since I watched a film that I hoped would never end. Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty, for me, was precisely that. A gripping cinematic adaptation of the long-drawn hunt for Osama Bin Laden in the wake of 9/11, I was amazed at how every second of the film held a sense of drama, even though the treatment of the film was far from dramatic.Like most films based on real events, particularly those that are so fresh in memory, Zero Dark Thirty is the kind of film that almost anyone can paraphrase in a few sentences, knowing pretty much how the story proceeds, and definitely knowing how it ends, even if they haven't watched the film. Yet, the film is so much more than just the story of how Bin Laden was found. For me, Zero Dark Thirty was partly a dramatization of a real life manhunt, partly a spy-thriller and mostly the intensely personal (and fictional) story of one persevering woman who makes it her life's mission to find and kill the man who spearheaded the death of over 3000 of her countrymen.The film follows Maya, a CIA agent recruited straight from college and eventually stationed in Islamabad; she has done nothing at CIA but look for Osama Bin Laden. From an awkward, mute spectator of the torture of captured terrorists orchestrated by her colleague to a ruthless executor of those very same torture techniques (though never losing her conscience or her discomfort with them), Maya obstinately tries every trick in the book, and some outside it, in an attempt to smoke out America's most wanted terrorist. Embellished with Alexandre Desplat's minimalist but haunting background score, the film is technically top-notch. So much so that you'll forgive some of the goofs; for example, the glimpse of the India Post signboard in a scene supposedly set in Pakistan (parts of the film were shot in Chandigarh). The camera that captures the action in Zero Dark Thirty is almost like another character in the film. It is always on the move, as nervous and fidgety as the characters themselves, almost as if it is as frustrated at the slow progress on tracking Bin Laden's whereabouts as the head honchos at the CIA. And if the camera is a character, then the soul of that character is undoubtedly the editing of the film. Splicing together chapters of 'the world's largest manhunt' across over a decade, across countries, hierarchies and departments while never losing that personal touch - the fact that it is humans hunting humans - the film has been creatively and technically edited to near-perfection. The final 20 minutes of the film are the icing on the cake. Post its US release, the film underwent its share of controversy. There is no doubt that the film's much-talked about torture scenes are gruesome (but never disgusting or unwatchable). But to say that the film either glorifies torture or distorts the truth behind the extent of the torture is unfathomably ignorant. Maya's reactions to the torture scenes and the manner in which she reacts even during and after she conducts some torture herself, quite amply illustrate the stand that Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal have taken, even though their approach to the film is remarkably close to neutral. For the second time in under a week, I watched Jessica Chastain anchor a film by achieving a remarkable graph in character that makes the viewer feel a personal stake in the character's story. That being said, her performance in Zero Dark Thirty is miles ahead of her performance in Mama. It is hard to imagine anyone else recreate the character of a frail, petite woman with nerves that can make most men nervous; she does it with various male characters in the film and you will never have trouble believing it.Joel Edgerton wasn't required for the role he plays, that of the leader of the SEAL team on Operation Neptune Spear. Having said that, the calming, reassuring effect of his sheer presence is hard to deny. A number of other supporting characters leave their mark; Jason Clarke as the man who initiates Maya into the interrogation process is excellent, as is Kyle Chandler, who plays the Islamabad station chief and Maya's boss. The film is never infused with any additional drama; the actual unfolding of the events does that by itself. As I mentioned earlier, so riveting is the narrative that I never wanted the film to end. At nearly two and three quarters of an hour, I didn't find the film too long at all, though I suspect there will be those that will. Still, whether you are interested in the procedural aspect of the hunt for Bin Laden or the dramatized portrayal of it, Zero Dark Thirty is a film that must be watched. ]"
301,"[ABCD - Anybody Can Dance has Gopi (Ganesh Acharya) tease Vishnu (Prabhu Deva) ""You want to make a Lagaan?"", when Vishnu expresses that he'll train some good-for-nothings from a slum area compete in a TV dance show. Within context, it is funny. As the movie progresses you realize Remo D'Souza actually made Lagaan cum ChakDe! India cum 3 Idiots. Unfortunately, not in terms of quality of narrative, but only in terms of the themes touched upon. This when all he actually wanted for ABCD - Anybody Can Dance to do is express his love for dance. Also, if there are so many choreographers interested in making a film about dancing, why can't we have a full-blown musical?Unfortunately, the dances here come across as aerobic and gymnastic routines, with a little yoga thrown in. Except for the extravaganza in the end, it's a true spectacle. Isn't dance a lot more about grace than being able to contort your body into twists and turns. For the joy of watching dance, I'd happily watch Madhuri Dixit in all her elegance or Sri Devi mimic Michael Jackson, even if it's just for half a minute.Fortunately, on the other hand, I knew what to expect. So, if you are a fan of Prabhu Deva kind of dancing, you are in for a treat. Even if a lot of the sequences look like they might be inspired from something already done elsewhere. However, I would think to showcase actual talent in dancing, shouldn't there have been many more long shots? Sure, the final dance is spectacular, yet it is nowhere close to the one in F.A.L.T.U or that in Aaja Nachle. Also, F.A.L.T.U had much more of a story than ABCD - Anybody Can Dance. While the twists in the end added an element of surprise, they fail to tug your heart the way they could have. There is so much dance to be showcased that there is no room for the characters to build a connect with you. At least, not enough for you to go beyond the obvious good vs evil. Other than that too, there were a few things that I liked about ABCD's story - the tight slap between a father and his son, the fact that Vishny eventually has no love interests to distract us from the main story. But, the typical character turn-arounds in the end nullify the things going for ABCD.However, ABCD if taken as a display of current-day dancing, is quite enjoyable. If only, it stuck to its title. When you say Anybody Can Dance, I would have wanted people like me, who have two left feet and are extremely conscious about it, to dance. But, it's ultimately, people who can dance, can dance.]"
302,"[When Special Chabbis ends, you go through the entire film in your mind (you are helped by some repeated scenes in the end) and you realize that some of the scenes were in the film, only to put you off track from cracking the mystery. Why else would people who know each other talk like strangers when they are by themselves in the story?Till then, you are holding on through Akshay Kumar, Anupam Kher and some of the others moving in slo-mo just because this is made by the guy who made A Wednesday - this HAS to lead to something good. In fact, the entire film feels like it is moving in slow motion, even when the camera is doing its job at regular speed. And yet you are giving it leeway. Good thing that smart one-liners delivered with some really good timing keep you interested in the film. That doesn't mean that the performances are top-notch. Except for Anupam Kher and Manoj Bajpayee, the rest are just plain. I cannot deny that it's a relief to see Akshay Kumar in a role where he isn't at his ""comic"" antics. Kajal Aggarwal is here only so that the fairer gender have some representation. Divya Dutt is given just the one line to repeat whenever it is predictably appropriate and the third woman is around just so she can  be told by her husband to wear a dupatta! The way the camera moves along the women's curves makes this film as respectful of women as any other film with an item number for X-factor. These are the things you don't expect after watching A Wednesday. Yes, with that one Neeraj Pandey had set up competition for himself with himself. I enjoyed the set-up. The film gives its audience the time to figure things out for themselves. Especially the 'who's who and doing what' bit isn't aided by people talking to each other as if they are meeting for the first time, or a voice-over trying to help us out. However, that becomes a bit of a drab later, as you feel you are continuously in an exposition mode. In fact, given the end, the entire film feels just like an introduction to a sequel, if not a series of films. It is sad then, to see out-of-place stylization and the lackluster conclusion. Also, when lead players in the film are not going to be nice people, you need a good amount of background about them, to be able to root for them. None of the lead characters, except Mr. Sharma (Anupam Kher) to a certain extent, get you invested in them. Nothing to keep you hooked through out. Sure, there is the sentiment of hurting the corrupt of our nation, of giving them what they deserve. But, it seemed half-baked and felt like it was a comment in the passing. Another side note is that no one in our country's administration and law enforcement believes in something as basic as checking credentials. Are we such a trusting nation?Yet, if you can forgive the writer in Neeraj Pandey for going out of his way to fool you into believing something, there are a couple of twists that do make you smile because of the way the characters seem to be outsmarting each other. But, along with that you have a lame love story, a few quirks that exist just for the sake of being quirky, and con-jobbers who are written more to con you than each other. ]"
303,"[Akaash Vani starts of as a regular love story and takes its time in establishing itself with sweet nothings. Then it creates such a tricky situation for the protagonist Vani (Nushrat Bharucha) that I daresay, many a Indian young girls find themselves in when it comes to choosing a partner for herself. Again, there is nothing novel at all about the situation, we have seen the dilemma over and over again, in the life of Indian cinema. But, the manner in which Akaash Vani tackles the situation is quite close to reality. If only, that reality was adhered to for a little longer.If you are expecting a Pyar Ka Punchnama repeat from Akaash Vani, you will be disappointing yourself. Akaash Vaani means serious business and has taken on a very everyday but loaded issue between parents and their young children. The generation gap played out beautifully. Our parents struggled a lot - in their careers, with their finances, in their relationships. But today's generation has moved up the Maslow's hierarchy of needs. What went by as 'normal' with our mothers, is an absolute no-no for us. I am so glad, writer-director Luv Ranjan picked the smaller issues which underline bigger issues, like the man asking for a glass of water from his woman, instead of the very obvious no-nos.Yet, the writing cops out at some instances. It does get a tad preachy and my 'other man' complaint a la Jab We Met stays. Why can't he be a decent, competent, likeable guy? Is it because it is just easier for love to try and win when he's a louse? The other big one which almost slides by is how Vani suddenly takes on her situation head-on. You almost let this one go by because you are rooting so strongly for her. And for this credit goes to Nushrat Bharucha. Her face withers and body droops with her situation from a sparkling, confident kid. Kartikeya Tiwari on the other hand is still ticking because of his puppy face. Whether or not he can act will be told only when he takes on something different from a lover boy. The other actor who gets us involved is Sunny Singh Nijjar as the relentless male chauvinist. A lot about Akaash Vani is courageous. To take up the topic of a love story which faces opposition in this day and age, when such stories are done to death, is brave. To take it on with such a slow pace when Indian films are getting shorter and shorter is an interesting decision, even if I might have been okay with a film that was thirty minutes shorter. To go the serious route after the laughter riot Pyar Ka Punchnama was made out to be is another bold move. And the most beautiful of them all, the one that made the movie for me was that characters didn't do 180 degree turn-arounds in their thoughts and attitudes. For the rest of the mile, there is always a next time. ]"
304,"[The smartest move from the makers of Mama was putting 'Guillermo Del Toro presents' in big, bold letters on the posters of the film. That is enough to draw fans of the supernatural genre and cinephiles in general to the theatres. Directed by Andres Muschietti, Mama is an old-fashioned horror film that works in spite of familiar tropes, because of the cold, stark feel of the film, and a story that connects with the viewer on a primal level. I must confess right now that I've never been scared while watching a horror film, and this time was no different. For me, Mama was a well-shot, moody and engaging story of maternal instinct that transcends rational human thought. So when I say that Mama works as a 'horror' film, I'm basing this opinion based on the gasps and nervous laughter I heard from my co-audience in the theater, and the grown man next to me who had his hands in his ears and his head buried into the shoulder of the woman sitting next to him. A brief prologue introduces us to Jeffrey, a depressed man who, after murdering his wife, kidnaps his two young daughters and disappears under mysterious circumstances. Cut to five years later, when two men hired by Jeffrey's brother, Lucas (who never gave up the hope of finding his two nieces again) finally find the two girls tucked away in an abandoned cabin. Except that the girls are less human and more beast-like, because of prolonged isolation from mankind. Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel take the girls in, hoping to rehabilitate them with the help of Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss, a psychiatrist. Things, of course, don't go as planned for Lucas and Annabel.Right from the outset, the mood of the film sucks you in. The washed out, sepia tone of the film as it opens, gradually becoming more gray as the film progresses, until the end, which is, for all intents and purposes, black - the film creates atmosphere that is hard not to be taken in by. Expectedly, the film has ample shots of shadows suddenly crossing your field of vision, startling use of the dark parts of a frame to deliver a few chills, sharp cuts accompanied by a screeching background score to shock you - all familiar turf for those who've any experience with horror cinema. Little girls, of course, make for excellent horror film subjects and this movie has two of them - enough to keep the audience on tenterhooks through the film.If the technique of the film aids in creating a tense, chilling mood, it is Jessica Chastain's performance as Annabel that creates the emotional connect that a film like this really needs. From bass guitarist in a rock band to a reluctant mother, her performance makes the transformation of her character believable, and most of the film's best moments involve her and the supernatural force in the film. However, the seemingly crisp 100-minute runtime of the film is actually a tad too long for its own good. The strength of a horror film really lies in the portions where nothing is actually happening. It is the anticipation of something happening that almost always contributes to scaring the daylights out of the audience. Mama works best when the supernatural figure isn't fully revealed. However once the audience actually sees the figure in its entirety, most of the fear element is sucked out. Proceedings eventually get a tad repetitive, and the climax lacks the kind of tension that would leave the audience on a nerve-wracking high. (Yes, the man next to me took his fingers out of his ears in the last fifteen minutes.) Also, I personally felt that the supernatural figure in the film is just not scary enough, because it looks too obviously computer-generated. Still, Mama works primarily because the moments of anticipation in the film almost always have the audience chewing away at more than just their fingernails. Mama is actually the kind of film which would be fun to watch in a packed cinema hall, because there is just something about being a part of a large group that flinches, jerks and gasps all at the same time. While I wasn't a part of the audience that reacted physically and audibly in my show, I still enjoyed the occasional spooky startle. Occasionally turning to my right to watch a grown man behave like a baby was the icing on the cake. ]"
305,"[Staying away from the constructs of a traditional biopic and concentrating on perhaps the most important months of Abraham Lincoln's Presidency, Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is a riveting character study and political drama. Widely regarded as one of the greatest American Presidents in history, Abraham Lincoln was an American hero, yes, but wasn't one to shy away from playing political games when he knew that the result would be of benefit to the nation. Spielberg's film takes a close look at this facet of Lincoln's personality, showing him to be a man simultaneously of impeccable ideals as well as of great political acumen, something that seems like such a rarity today. Undeniably though, the greatest takeaway from Lincoln is the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role. Be it his look in the film - an uncanny replica of the real Lincoln - to his every mannerism, Daniel Day-Lewis virtually disappears beneath Abraham Lincoln. His creased face, that instantly recognizable beard, that slight hunch of his shoulders subtly showing the burden that the highest office in the country brings with it, the confident use of his hands, the reassuring smile masking a pensive state of mind - here is a master class in acting from one of the very best.The film is set in the latter half of the 19th century, during the American Civil War. The year is 1865 and President Lincoln has just been re-elected for his second term, while the nation grapples with the bloody effects of the war between the Union and the Confederacy. The Thirteenth Amendment to the United State Constitution, aimed at abolishing slavery, has been passed by the Senate and is now before the House of Representatives. A two-thirds majority is required for it to be passed in the House, but Lincoln's Republican Party has only slightly over half of the number they require; the rest have to be obtained by winning over Democrats to vote in favour of the Amendment. In the tense political climate, the will and ability of Abraham Lincoln is tested to the full.What is remarkable about the film is how characters who are against the Thirteenth Amendment openly proclaim that all men aren't created equal, how certain races are superior to others and how the 'coloured people' are meant to serve as slaves to the White Man. The dangerous, politically incorrect 'N' words are used freely, as it was in the period when the film is set. Seeing as how, even today, Indian cinema and audiences are subjected to naive political censorship based on the whims of fanatical groups and spineless political parties, it is heartening to see a mature film-going audience that understands that one of the purposes of cinema is to inform as well, and how is one supposed to inform if one isn't permitted to show the truth as it happened?The look of the film is a plus; the period feel is captured beautifully through the art direction and production design. Also, other than the gargantuan effort by Daniel Day-Lewis, there are other performances in the film that stand out as well, notably that of Tommy Lee Jones as caustic Congressman Thaddeus Stevens and David Strathairn as Lincoln's Secretary of State. Sally Field and Joseph Gordon-Levitt do well in their roles as Mary Todd Lincoln and Robert Lincoln (Lincoln's wife and oldest son, respectively) though one wishes that they had larger roles to play. Having said that, Lincoln isn't for everyone. The film isn't a collection of highlights of Lincoln's career. It is, instead, a deeply rooted study of one particular phase that acted as a test of character for President Lincoln. It takes its time to unfold, because it is, almost at all times, long scenes of groups of men sitting together and talking. But that is probably how politics 'happens' in real life as well. The President himself often strays off course to deliver an anecdote invariably tinged with humour before making the point that he wants to. The film isn't slow, because something is always happening. But what is happening isn't action-filled; it is human minds at work. Thus, clocking in at two and a half hours, there will certainly be those who find the film boring. Lincoln isn't the kind of film that will find universal appeal amongst theater-going audiences in India. But it will certainly appeal to those who are fascinated by history in general and by the character study of historical figures in particular. And for those who want a 'fun' film on Lincoln, there is always Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.]"
306,"[Mature love, love between a mother and a daughter, insecurity that a child might feel about her parents however old she might be - all this weaving in and out of memories as a theme. Listen...Amaya has to be one of the sweetest films I have seen in the last few years. Yes, there are moments of drama and there are very few moments that you wish were done better. But, for the most parts Listen...Amaya is a warm, touching film that keeps you engaged with its characters and how relatable they are.Amaya, Amaya's mother, Leela and the friends they make through their cafe are all very urban characters which make them very homely for us, the multiplex audience. It poses a few questions. The questions themselves or the fact that they were asked has the potential to make even the most liberal of us consider their appropriateness. What can make an adult daughter of a modern mother, both women of today, uncomfortable?The insight of some of the dialogue, small one liners stay with you when you walk out. The rest of the dialogue is the everyday kind you would hear in any of the city households and yet it is not mundane. The dialogue is made fresh by some wonderful performances by the lead characters. Deepti Naval and Swara Bhaskar are so comfortable and make you so comfortable about them that you forget you are watching a movie for a bit. You are completely involved in their interactions, so invested in their relationship for most parts of the film. Farouque Shaikh brings with him peace and stability as his character Jayant goes in and out of frames. You really begin to care for the aging Jayant, and his failing health. If only, the side characters could match up or even be half the potential of these three leads. Everytime, anyone other than these three is on the screen you are jolted into reality that it is only a film after all. Then there's a song that comes out of nowhere, ill-fit despite it's old-school-ness. Also, maybe for the build-up, the one necessary character transition came a little too quick. But, the manner in which the film ends makes up for the things that it misses. The matter of death of those you love and how different people deal with it differently, how time heals and how we associate loyalty and memories is brought about beautifully. A small gem like this makes the word 'genuine' spring for itself. A sweet story that would've meant nothing but for the performances. Performances which would have meant nothing if the story wasn't what it was. A film that makes your day not seem like a waste. ]"
307,"[With David, Bejoy Nambiar struggles the gray area between right and wrong. Be it love or war - whether an action is right or wrong, many a time, becomes debatable given the situation. Nambiar explores that zone in-between. Unfortunately, only one of the three tales he chooses is compelling and there is a half baked one. Though the third one struggled the most with the dilemma, it seemed more like a comic and romantic relief to take the edge off the seriousness of the other two. David (London, 1975 - Neil Nitin Mukhesh) is part of a Muslim underworld family. Though he is not a part of the family, he is trusted the most. Yet, the family is keeping some of his personal history from him. Should that change his alliance with the family? The most layered of the three, this is the one that tears its David up the most. The black and white treatment stands in good contrast to David's conflict within.David (Mumbai, 1999 - Vinay Virmani) belongs to a lower middle-class Christian family. A local politician accuses his father, a priest, of trying to convert Hindus into Muslims. David's struggle as a common man is much like the situation of the common man today, over a decade later. The build up in this one with David's quest for why he and his family are suffering kept me intrigued. However, it loses steam towards the end. The way it culminates though resonated the most with me. David (Goa, 2010 - Chiyaan Vikram) is a Goan village's outcast because his wife left him at the wedding altar. Other than the fact, that that makes no sense, I believe in the human race's capacity to hold one person's misfortunes against him. The simplest of them all this one should have had its David miserable between friendship and love. But, somehow that ground is left uncovered and gets diverted with its humor that shuffles between dark, slapstick and quirky.One of David's main problems is the length. Though it has three stories to tell, there are times when the film feels like it is a little all over the place. The only thing holding it together are awesome performance across the board. From the three main leads to Monica Dogra, Tabu, Saurabh Shukla and the people he possesses, right upto Rohini Hatangadi - all give play their bits with conviction.There is one thing I have begun to love about Bejoy Nembiar's films. The way he picturizes his songs. The most unlikely songs are set against some brutal action sequences and yet they sound and look beautiful. Of course, the rest of the film too is slick and has a classy touch to it. The good news is that the feeling I got in Shaitan that his film is a vehicle to showcase all the ""cool"" things he ever wanted to have in films, has reduced. So, yet again, I am left looking forward to his next film. If only, it had more to hold the film together. As far as the connection between the three Davids goes, one David doesn't let the other go out of character while sticking to his roots. The third one, well he's just there waiting to be noticed by one other David. Let's just say this, the three are as connected as you and I. I write what you read, you read what I write. We are all connected by the cosmic energy in between. Call it fate, or call it God's will. ]"
308,"[Two disclaimers - I saw the Hindi version. I have never been a Kamal Haasan fan.It has been ages since I've seen a Kamal Haasan film. The only reason I chose to watch the film was the ban - my way of showing support. I had decided to watch the film even if the Hindi version wasn't playing in a theater close to me. Even if I didn't understand a word. Fortunately, there was a Hindi version I could catch. Only for me to find out how much sillier the ban is than I originally thought it was. The only group of people it speaks against is the Taliban/Jihadis/Mujahiddins. So, did I get this right? Making this group of people out as villains hurts sentiments? Whose? Vishwaroop is a very average action flick at best and shouldn't be considered any more than that. I have never enjoyed Kamal Haasan's histrionics. He has always been a little over-the-top, caricaturish for my taste. The only thing I liked about Vishwaroop is Kamal Haasan's act, despite his effeminate act to induce laughter. Later in the film, he does make you believe about his reservations to the behavior of the people around him. Unfortunately, the people around him are annoying caricatures that are annoying, especially Omar, the one enacted  by Rahul Bose and oh yes, Nirupama, Vishwanath's wife played by Pooja Kumar. It didn't even look like it would be any better if here dubbing was better than that you see in English movies on TV. Only Jaideep Ahlawat seemed to be taking his role seriously. It doesn't help that the film is forced into becoming a comedy because of some lame behavior by the members of the Taliban. The action except for the first sequence - which is pretty cool, especially because of the repetition - is pretty ordinary. The rest of the action tries to horrify based on gore, which doesn't work at all. There was some potential of an engaging story when it delves into the lifestyle of the Jihadis' families. But soon you feel cheated because it is done only with the purpose getting you emotionally involved temporarily. Whatever interest is created fizzles out as the second half turns into the regular terrorism-based action flick. Let alone novel, it is pretty shoddily handled. Almost everything about Vishwaroop seems superficial. The dots aren't connected well. And yes,  you have been promised a Vishwaroop II.And yet, I shall rephrase a Voltaire quote that is often repeated these days I might not like what you have to say and how you say it, but I shall support your right to say it.]"
309,"[The saying that a film is written twice - once on the writing table and once on the editing table - has been used and abused more often than is completely healthy. Yet, the experience of watching Mani Ratnam's Kadal is fraught with moments where you are reminded of this uncompromising theorem repeatedly. Enough, at least, to make the most ardent Mani Ratnam zealots like myself wonder if the great man's heart was really in this film in the first place.Set primarily in a Christian fishing village, Kadal is tale of love, faith, revenge and loss. An incident in a seminary between two men leads to an enmity that lasts a lifetime. Years later, caught in the middle of this saga is a young orphan Thomas, who is essentially a wanderer - a boy whose choices, and hence destiny, hinge on the beliefs of these two men standing at opposite ends of the spectrum of faith.The film, armed with an interesting premise, a legendary director and a slew of experienced and accomplished technicians, is at best a patchy effort - let down mostly by the screenplay (co-written by Mani Ratnam himself) and the editing, by his long-term collaborator, A. Sreekar Prasad.Be it the narration of the story itself or the emotions that the scenes and situations intend to convey, the graph of the film is highly uneven. Strange, because Ratnam and Prasad are both masters at designing a narrative; at weaving situations together without dumbing things down, while not forcing viewers to make generous leaps of faith either. A number of their previous collaborations like Kannathil Muthamittal, Alaipayuthey and Aaytha Ezhuthu come to mind. Making matters worse is the runtime of the film, a whopping two and three-quarters of an hour. Also, for a film named Kadal (which means 'sea'), the most striking void I felt when I walked away from the film was how even the continuous presence of the sea in the film didn't affect me emotionally or even visually. Intended perhaps as allegory for God - the sea, after all, is as all-consuming and unrelenting for sinners and yet as all-embracing and omnipotent for those seeking redemption, as faith itself - it fails to create the connect that viewers so desperately need while involving them in a story with universal values but with a highly local flavour.A. R. Rahman's refreshingly haunting soundtrack for the film helps to some extent; it stays with you long after the film. However, the manner in which most of the songs were filmed left me disappointed as well - 'Adiye' and 'Nenjukulle' in particular. Again, extremely strange, considering Mani Ratnam's particular expertise in picturizing songs. Rajiv Menon's cinematography, while slightly uneven, is largely an asset because of some enchanting frames. Undoubtedly a tough film to shoot, it manages to retain the gritty, rustic feel of the village without ever compromising on the contemporary look and style of the film.Kadal marks the return of Arvind Swamy after a long hiatus of over a decade, and the man hasn't forgotten how to act. His calming, serene presence adds an unquantifiable and undeniable measure of stability to the film, anchoring it throughout. The return of a veteran is complemented by the debuts of two star offspring. Gautham Karthik's unconventional, scruffy look suits his character Thomas, but he still has some distance to cover in the emoting and dialogue delivery departments. Even so, Kadal is a good debut for the youngster. His love interest Beatrice is played by Thulasi Nair, who looks pretty, but is also still quite raw as an actress. The nearly three hours I spent in the theatre had me almost frozen from start to end. As an ardent film buff and a student of cinema, I was left alternately in awe of the director whom I look up to more than most Indian filmmakers, and at the same time, disappointed because for perhaps the first time ever, my emotional and cinematic connect with a Mani Ratnam film was sporadic at best. The mastery is still there, no doubt, but I couldn't help feeling that Mani Ratnam's heart just wasn't into it this time round.]"
310,"[If there is one thing we have learnt from Race it is that you trust no one. No one at all. And that doesn't change in Race 2. Characters make it to Abbas-Mustan's world only if they are conniving. Even the seemingly annoying and trying-to-play-dumb Cherry (Ameesha Patel) is sly in her own way, within her context. This world would have passed of as decent fiction, if only the contrived twists in the tale weren't unending. Each character getting a chance to smirk, ""I knew it. You thought you fooled me?"" or ""I had planted this ploy to put you off-track."" gets tiring. If everyone knows everything, what are we watching the film for? To figure out who knows less? The one-upmanship can keep you intrigued only for so long. Can there be a limit to this when one villain claims everything owned by the other villain to be his, because a profit of 5 billion Euros is not good enough? Even in relative terms, that 5 billion is a 33% profit in 2 days! Fine, I shall control the Chartered Accountant in me. Hey, each of the lead characters look like a million bucks. Or make that a few billion. While I can rant and rage about how awfully distasteful the objectification of women is here, and it is loathsome to say the least, I have to admit that gender equality is maintained in the objectification. John Abraham and Saif Ali Khan are bare-chested long enough. And while the others have to just look like they have an alternate plan of double-crossing on their mind, John Abraham does manage to create that extra amount of scare, for he makes the character he plays, Armaan Malik, look like he'll stop at nothing. If only there was some oomph added in terms of good, memorable dialogue or if the characters were given a little more depth, it would have given something for people like me to chew on. Unpredictability which seems like it exists only to increase the run-time of the film, hasn't done its job well. The chase sequences, the fight (boxing) sequences, the scenic beauty of various exotic locations are all captured very well - right from the close-up of a scorpion to the scorpion shaped party deck to the aqueduct to the mountainous beauty of Europe. But, what's with the shoddy graphics work? From the bullet that leaves a sniper's gun to the airplane in the sky - all one botched up job after another. Unfortunately, there is no X-factor in the songs either. They just all look the same - not just to each other in the film, but across films of this genre which carry glitter, glamour and gleam with pride. No novelty whatsoever.Beautiful looking people with twisted minds. Beautiful locations with crime and more crime. Yet, the potentially beautiful duality gets repetitive and tedious. And as if you hadn't guessed it already, the director duo have given themselves scope to fix it at the third go. Yes, I know not why, but I still hope. Maybe because I hope that some day Saif Ali Khan or Anil Kapoor will wake up from their stupor and will want to deliver quality products they are capable of producing.]"
311,"[On the surface, Inkaar is a story about sexual harassment in the workplace. But a layer under, it is about the inability of ambitious people coming to terms with their feelings, about how they use all resources available at their disposal to mask their complexes (superior and inferior) and insecurities. Does she really, truly believe she is being harassed? Are the devils in her mind perceiving casual flirtation as harassment? Is he flirting only casually? Does he not realise he is trying to evoke something deeper within her? Lovely, murky, gray areas. All rendered redundant by a climax that stands awesome by itself but loses its meaning and makes the film lose face in the context of the film. To do that to a story that broaches a serious abuse rampant in current times is belittling the issue. But, hey should we hold our directors responsible for taking on social agendas? So, if we take away the responsibility Inkaar makes for an interesting watch till about the last half hour and the last half hour is interesting by itself. It's the fact that they are put together that spoils the taste.The interest is built and maintained though by all departments. I have always liked the atmosphere Sudhir Mishra creates in his films. They are either set in the rural parts of India or they show the grit of the urban world (except Khoya Khoya Chand which was set in an era long past). Inkaar requires him to stay in the chic world of the cities today and I liked the sepia tone he chose for the film, giving it a dark, edgy feel. Though I don't associate brown with the corporate world. Yet, the camera work contributes to the highly strung atmosphere in the office of an advertising agency. However, the music, though good, seems out of place for the setting.Also, the back and forth in the story's linearity feels like a cop out. As if the makers weren't confident of pulling it off had it played out linearly. Fortunately, some of the dialogue is good and is even cheeky at times - bringing in the smiles and knowing nods. I especially enjoyed Arjun Rampal's performance. He brings in the perfect amount of nonchalance to Rahul Verma's demeanour - the kind that a calm, confident man would carry to make you believe that he is not in the wrong. Chitrangda Singh does nothing special except that she looks chic and just right for her part. I absolutely loved Deepti Naval's act - charming, witty, naughty and curious all rolled into one. It's a shame that ultimately her character seems like a cog in the wheel. Yet, another film where the makers seem to not want to take the concept all the way. Why not make it all about the 'sexual harassment'? Why not make it all about what it really wanted to be about - the part that I cannot give away? Why oh why, lessen the weight of the issue or the depth of emotions? ]"
312,"[You can only sympathize with filmmakers who believe they are making a good, relevant film; who think they are being stylish by introducing the hero in slow-motion; who think their film is intelligent with chess-metaphors, explained in detail, no less. Only if these filmmakers sympathize with their audience who have seen it all, way too many times - in worse or better forms and in mediocre versions too. So, some of the specific problems of this particular crime drama which has the law and administration working hand-in-hand with the underworld are as follows -A non-performer in lead role, Sachiin Joshi. Even the makers are so insecure about his acceptance as a hero that a song has to be written to establish that - 'poster fatega toh hero hi niklega' (if a poster is being torn, the one coming through has to be the hero). Not only is his dialogue delivery flat, his voice doesn't seem to have broken all that well. Even though, Prakash Raj tries to infuse some sort of interest with his performance, he ends up being repetitive (also from his earlier films). Prashant Narayanan has too small a role to make any sort of impact.  Aditya Pancholi doesn't create any ripples with his role either. Sudesh Berry come in as a pleasant surprise and is entertaining with his accent which gets old within five minutes. The women have skimpily written roles for them to be talked about at all. This one has two villains, which should have worked in favor of the film. They corner the protagonist pretty bad too. Yet, because of the caricatures that they are and the genre of the film, you know how they are going to end up. Even so, they had the potential to get us interested by the soup that the hero lands up in with them. If only, he didn't get out of it so easily. The setting includes dance bars and drugs rendering itself to a lot of cleavage, pole dances and lousy lyrics set to lousier music. And yet, none of this is a surprise. It was close to what any of us might have expected.]"
313,"[Note: This is one of the rare occasions when the reviewer has chosen to revise the ratings. The rating after first viewing (at Mumbai Film Festival) was "" Catch on DVD for sure"". It has been bumped up to ""The keen must watch on screen; else DVD"" after second viewing (regular theater cut) for reasons stated below. ------Update: Whether it is because of what seemed like a crisper cut for the theatrical release, or whether it is because of a correction in my expectations, having already watched the film once at MFF 2012, I'm not sure; but I liked Pune 52 more after the second viewing. Much like Talaash, which set the expectations for a thriller but was more of one man's emotional journey and was best enjoyed with those expectations in mind, Pune 52 is more about the marital problems faced by a lower middle class couple in the early 90s, and makes the most impact when seen as a drama rather than a thriller.The performances by Girish Kulkarni and Sonali Kulkarni seemed even better this time. Also, the dialogues, penned by Girish Kulkarni, are outstandingly written. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I keep saying that Girish Kulkarni is one of the best Indian writers as well as actors today, and he underlines this in Pune 52. The larger issues in the film - sketchily written characters, gaping plot holes and screenplay flaws remain. Since the film is a thriller as well, I can't talk about these in detail, but it will suffice to say that there are just too many loopholes that can be pointed out in the writing. Still, for the manner in which it is shot, for being an engaging enough drama about a married couple, for the dialogues and for the performances Pune 52 is a film that makes for one theatrical watch, for sure.------Easily one of the most disappointing films of the year so far, Pune 52 is one of those films that seem to promise so much at various points during their runtime, but fail to deliver as a whole, for various reasons.Set in Pune during one of the most critical times in the history of our country - the economic liberalization days of the early 90s - it tells the story of Amar Apte and his wife Prachi, who are facing problems that stem from what Amar does for a living - he is a private detective who snoops into peoples' personal lives. Amar takes his work extremely seriously, even though others around him seem to have nothing but contempt for his lack of 'success'. Things take a turn for the murky when Amar gets involved in a case that brings him into contact with a woman named Neha. As mentioned earlier, Pune 52 always promised a lot. Intriguing promos and exciting names like Girish and Umesh Kulkarni associated with the film meant that the pressure was always on the cast and crew to deliver a knockout film. And that they certainly don't, the primary reason for it being the writing. As a character, Amar has been written shoddily. His 'dreams' of becoming a detective since he was a child seem forced and unconvincing. The 'Eureka' moment he narrates, which convinced him that he wanted to be a detective makes little sense, and the flip-flops his character makes form such a shaky character graph that it does irreparable damage to the graph of the film itself. As a thriller, the film's plot twists are predictable from a mile away. Perhaps the most disappointing part is the fact that at one point the film seems to be walking the Chinatown path, raising hopes, but then spiraling away into unflinching mediocrity soon after.As a drama between a couple whose marriage is on the rocks, the film does have its moments. The fights between Amar and Prachi are written realistically and are performed brilliantly. Also, one can't deny that the film does manage to hold the audience as far as the tension with regard to the destiny of this failing marriage is concerned.If the film remains watchable for a large part of it, it is because of the actors. Girish Kulkarni is easily one of the best actors in the country today, and he tries his best to lift his poorly written character. He manages to succeed sometimes, making you root more for him than for Amar. The fact that his voice has been dubbed over by someone else irks at times, if you are used to Girish's natural voice. Of course, it was probably done in the interest of the film, since Girish's natural voice would've been too thin for the character.Sonali Kulkarni is dependable as always. She emotes beautifully when conveying her frustration over the marriage. Her character is essentially naive, and she convinces you of that naivete. Sai Tamhankar as the mysterious Neha looks better than she's ever looked, and she manages to bring about that air of intrigue about her.Also, a good amount of effort has been put into the production design to create the 90s feel. The old rotating dial phones, film posters, the license plate numbering of that time and even Gold Spot manage to add a feel to it. Although why exactly the film is set in that time period is a mystery. The film has been shot well only in certain parts. There are a number of inexplicably over-exposed shots, too many for it to seem necessary.Debutante director Nikhil Mahajan handles certain portions well. Also, his choice of shooting long dialogue scenes in single shots really impressed me. They show a mature attitude towards cinema. However, in the larger scheme of things his inexperience shows. Certain critical portions, particularly the thriller and backstory bits needed a more seasoned hand at the helm. The film is also far too long for its own good. Hopefully, the filmmakers will think of getting a shorter cut ready for its theatrical release. Pune 52 is by no means unwatchable. But, considering the expectations I had from the film, I walked away extremely disappointed. Update: A slight correction to the above review. According to director Nikhil Mahajan, Girish Kulkarni has dubbed his own lines for the film. Also, the cut of the film shown at MFF 2012 is a work-in-progress cut. The theatrical cut for the film is still being readied and is expected to be different from the one premiered at MFF.]"
314,"[Tom Hooper's grandiose vision brings Victor Hugo's epic novel and the long-running stage production based on it to cinematic life; the film, however, is virtually owned by the performance of Hugh Jackman. Beautifully shot, with a complex narrative that is expertly edited and embellished with some truly outstanding performances, Les Miserables isn't the easiest of films to watch, particularly for Indian audiences - more on this a little later. Still, the film has enough meat in it for the really keen to enjoy, if indulgent grandeur is your thing.Set across nearly two decades in early 19th century France, the film is an epic tale of love, duty, honour and freedom; where men lock horns in battles of principle that last a lifetime. Jean Valjean is a thief who is serving time for stealing a loaf of bread. 19 years into his sentence, he is released on parole. An encounter with a Bishop sparks something in him that causes him to break parole and disappear. Why I believe Indian audiences will find Les Miserables a hard film to digest is because there is almost no spoken dialogue - the characters converse by singing their lines almost throughout the film. A tough, applause-worthy task for the actors no doubt, but something that the audience here is just not exposed enough to, to appreciate fully. Add to that the fact that the film is undeniably on the indulgent side - it takes time to unfold, the characters sing long portions just to themselves, and the editing is frenetic, to keep pace with the musical narrative. But there is reward to be found for those who can endure the gargantuan indulgence on display. The production design, costumes and make-up are absolutely top-notch; the streets of 19th century Paris come alive in every frame, which in themselves are works of photographic art. To add to that, I spent every five minutes marveling at the editing and the manner in which the entire film is put together. Some of the performances, then, are the icing on a rather large cake. Hugh Jackman's performance is, by far, the most striking thing about Les Miserables; even more than the production design, in my opinion. His eyes and his body language embody the complex character of Jean Valjean, whose journey the film essentially traces. It doesn't hurt at all that he also sings beautifully. It took me a while to get used to Russell Crowe singing his lines as Inspector Javert, but once I did, both his character as well as his performance grew on me. Anne Hathaway in Spandex is an image that I was unable to shake out of my head prior to watching this film, but her performance as Fantine helped immensely in that regard; her role is small, but her performance is spellbinding. Amanda Seyfried looks gorgeous, and Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter are goofy, but provide some much-needed comic relief.Les Miserables, as I mentioned earlier, is not a film for everyone. It works better for people who can appreciate individual bits of filmmaking magic, than for people who want to get sucked into the whole experience of a film in totality. I'd still recommend it, because it isn't often that films like this see a theatrical release in India. Besides, for the performances and technical magnificence alone, it is a film worth experiencing.]"
315,"[I had an option of studying Greek Literature in college, and it all seemed so interesting with evil fathers, Oedipal sons and ostracized siblings - much like the plot of our television shows. I didn't opt for it finally, but before watching this weeks' Wrath of the Titans I thought I should read up a bit on Greek Mythology, so my movie watching experience could be devoid of questions. Wrong move. If you're going to watch Wrath of the Titans (I strongly suggest you spend your money otherwise), please treat this as another action film with the heroes fighting monsters created out of the computer and nothing more. (Think Clash of the titans, John Carter and suchlike) Sequel to 2010's Clash of the Titans, Wrath of the Titans isn't an intriguing celebration of Greek mythology laced with universal morals that are passed down for generations. Maybe I was being too wishful to believe so, but I was proven wrong with this watered down version of a mash between Transformers and Immortals. The film begins with demi-god, Persues (Sam Washington) and his humble life as a fisherman. He is visited by Zeus (played by Laim Neeson) who informs him that the gods are losing their Godliness to the Humans and a dangerous war is brewing. Together, Zeus, Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Posiedon (Danny Huston) had overthrown Persues' evil father Kronos, but now they must strike a deal with him to regain power and remain immortal. While each brother is battling it out to gain autonomy, Persues', being the hero (and yes, there is no built up to why he was chosen in the first place) must save the human-race. Wrath of the Titans lacks a sense of story and structure. For a sequel, it assumes the viewer has seen the previous film and is well-versed with the small nitty-gritty's of every character's history. It's like expecting to remember your relatives' middle names and how they are remotely related to you. Before you can clear your doubt, a monster pops up on the screen: between three-headed made-up animals and a puffed up man-buffulo, you're expecting pretty much anything to pop up on screen as a ""threat"". The CG team is the real winner here. There's no energy in the story-telling. When you revisit an older era, where the culture, habits and look is starkly different, the representation is usually one of awe and passion. Passion to bring out a world that we have only read of in books and more importantly a passion to tell a story based in that world. Wrath of the Titans looked more like a videogame to me - with no enthusiasm in the performances (a waste of the talented Ralph Fiennes), confused sense of structure and an overkill of visual effects. I strongly recommend you miss this one. ]"
316,"[The single most important thing for a thriller to work is a lack of loopholes. From a story that seems to be smart and appears to have it all sorted-out Aa Dekhen Zara becomes so full of holes that you have to sieve through them to reach the basic plot. At half-point you know you are not looking at some great work of art but you are looking forward to some quick-paced slick piece of thrill. And then you hear the cookie crumble, but you try to ignore it. ""It can't be that bad"" you say. And then you see it crumble and know that the damage is irreparable. The inevitable, irrelevant, sleazy dance begins. Some villainous looking men ask a sexy lady to dance and she obliges. Except that there is nothing fearsome about those guys. This one song is indescribably out-of-place not only situation-wise but also out-of-synch with the general tone of the movie. Not to mention that it's hilarious to see Neil Nitin Mukesh call Bipasha Basu gori (fair skinned). And yet before any of this comes along there are other things that are avoided that make the film a tad bit charming. With something as powerful as a piece of equipment that can make predictions, the protagonists don't aim at anything lofty or altruistic. So, you don't see the film taking its purpose too seriously. Unfortunately, it takes itself too lightly and the entire suspense, ""damn! What next?"" results in an anti-climatic molehill. Like most departments, the dialogues too are inconsistent. The occasionally witty lines dive into blech and float back to average. Thankfully though, Neil Nitin Mukesh's narration of his character, Ray's thoughts were not as annoying as such spoon-feeding can usually be. I really don't know how they managed that because Neil didn't really need to emote, his voiceover left no doubt about what he was thinking. That still doesn't mean that he didn't act well. There's something that his eyes do which could have conveyed the thought if they were allowed to. Bipasha Basu playing DJ, Simi...well, she does the little bit she can emote if the audience can be bothered to look above her neck. Hey! I'm not being voyeuristic, she was there for a purpose and I damn well appreciate it, right? Well, she does her usual excellent job of looking good. Other than that, her costumes looked like costumes and not dresses that a normal person would wear. The rest of the cast has done a hideously superficial job. Earlier in the movie though, I found myself enjoying the pace. It doesn't stop at anything or for anyone. Aa Dekhen Zara smoothly flows from one incident into another, especially in the beginning. I especially enjoyed the pace of the romance between Ray and Simi. In fact, I enjoyed a romantic moment in cinema after a long, long time. Later, like the rest of the movie, the even pace too becomes jerky because of the jumps it feels obligated to take. Oh, by the way, if you are looking to take away some cool action sequences at the very least - let me save you some time, money, and energy. There's none. Some light, nice build-up is what we have in the first half and a burst balloon in the second. ]"
317,"[There's always a story behind how the film was made and every once in a while the viewer likes to voice out how he thinks it must've panned out. So this is how Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola just might have rolled.Not-so-sober Vishal Bharadwaj: This system is frustrating, the politicians are despicably corrupt, the businessmen are making biryani out of the farmer's blood and labor, this country is going down the tube. We need to do something!Sober Vishal Bharadwaj: Let's make  a movie.Not-so-sober VB: Ah-ha! Why not? People protest by participating in peace marches, wearing pink chaddis, and replace their display pictures with black dots on Facebook and Twitter. They do what they know how to do, I know how to make films. Perfect.Sober VB: But, all this political shoo-shaa, the angst of the farmer, etc is too serious, our aam junta will get terribly bored. Not-so-sober VB: Political satire it is, then!Sober VB: Good thinking, there! Let's add a love angle to the mix, just for good measure.Not-so-sober VB: You think? I was hoping to add a woman to the mix but more like a vamp. Sober VB: You have yours, I'll have mine. Deal?Not-so-sober: Only if you let me go a little crazy.Sober VB: Crazy is good, the multiplex junta loves it! Not-so-sober VB: Promise me, you won't let go of the focus on the issue with the love triangle.Sober VB: I'll sign the papers, if you don't go overboard with the crazy bit just because I agreed. Not-so-sober VB: Yes! dances the happily-ever-after dance Anything that is repeated too often or for too long, like the film's quirkiness or this reviewing style, gets old  too soon. Fortunately or unfortunately, both not-so-sober VB and sober VB got to make their films, respectively. Yes, as usual, the not-so-sober one makes more sense. Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola starts the bang with an incredibly insane title - it readies you for the zaniness to look forward to. The 'no smoking' disclaimer is a witty, ironical, slap-in-the-face start to a film. The buffoonery begins and builds up to a ""you got to be kiddin' me"" level. And just at the right moment, a decent element of story is added in the form of a strong, burning issue in the country. The issue at hand represents many other issues we are faced with in the real world. The politician represents how we as the citizens perceive our politicians. And how we see them play footsie with the businessmen whose deep pockets want to grow only deeper while taking the entire nation for a ride. Then, you wait for the big climax, you wait for the drama to reach a peak, you wait for the big climax, you wait for the exhilaration that it will bring along, you wait for the big climax. And it doesn't come. I am ever-so-grateful to Vishal Bharadwaj for not making the climax a huge jingoistic movement. I am also grateful to him for not having characters make u-turns from their basic natures. I can't even complain about the end being silly because I indeed thought it'd be atrociously out-of-this-world kind-of silly. I have a feeling I'd have enjoyed it that way because of the build-up of craziness. Unfortunately, it doesn't go all the way.Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola cannot claim to be about the three characters Matru, Bijli and Mandola either. None of them is given any depth nor are any of the relationships paid attention to. To seal the anti-climax, comes the title song made solely for the purpose of marketing and you give a Rohit-Shetty/Farah-Khan worthy shudder as you see Shabana Azmi (who plays a vamp) do the signature dance step! Why?It is one thing to make a political satire about a serious issue and quite another to market the movie as comedy and fun without letting the audience in on the seriousness. Are the viewers not worthy of knowing what the film is really about? Or do the makers not have the guts of selling the product for what it is? Make Shabana Azmi dance out-of-context, really? I can't get over it.And yet, despite some episodic side-plots, Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola is not a complete wash-out. It has some disarmingly witty dialogue, especially reserved for Mandola (Pankaj Kapur). There are at least three scenes in the second half that stay with you because of powerful lines, insight, sarcasm, and delivery. And if these don't work for you, Pankaj Kapur's performance alone is enough to carry this film for you. From the mumbling alcoholic to the delirious alcohol-quitter to the stone-sober, cold businessman - Pankaj Kapur does the whole range without once going over-the-top despite the genre of goofy satire that the film belongs to. Shabana Azmi holds her ground as the ambitious and manipulative politician. She has one scene that she could have shined in. But she is overpowered by the theatrical setting that is necessary  for the powerful and insightful dialogue she delivers. Imran Khan doesn't have much scope to be different from his usual except for occasionally slipping into a Haryanvi accent. And as I said, like anything that is repeated too often or for too long, Anushka Sharma's wink-and-grin-wide routine is getting old too. Arya Babbar gets to play stupid and well he plays it appropriately.I don't mind a serious film, I don't mind socio-politics, I don't mind satire, I certainly don't mind quirky, dark humor. What I don't get though is why a film can't pick one or two of these themes and stick to it through and through - be there, build-up on it  and end like the makers believed in what they were making, without any external pressures. ]"
318,"[There is no easier way to say this, so I'm just going to say it; I was extremely disappointed with Gangoobai. An NFDC-produced film, made on a script that was an NFDC Screenwriters' Lab selection in 2009 and developed further thereon, I expected it to be extremely strong at least on the script level. There is no denying that the film has heart and soul. It talks about hope and what it means for a human being, about how materialistic life has become today and about how human spirit still has the power to triumph over the greatest of travails. However, the film suffers from writing that can only be described as naive. The film follows the journey of an aging bai (maid-servant) who lives in sylvan Matheran, a hill-station not far from Mumbai. In the course of her work, she chances upon something that entices her heart beyond limits of rationality. Spurred by a burning desire to possess it, she toils hard for four years before managing to accumulate enough money to buy it. Then, she sets on a journey to Mumbai to purchase the said item, expecting to return within a day. However, the journey doesn't quite go as planned. As I mentioned earlier, the naivety of the film's writing is something that I still can't get over. The attempt to evoke emotions with regard to Gangoobai is so evident that it often feels manipulative. The film doesn't try and tug at your heartstrings; it tries to manhandle them. Also, every single character in the film is far-fetched; there isn't a hint of realism to their actions, their words or their reactions to Gangoobai. No matter how they seem on the exterior, the manner in which they instantly treat Gangoobai like the centre of the world continuously rings false. Gangoobai herself seems to have only one defect - her obsessive behaviour regarding possessing something that she doesn't really need. Apart from that, she is the perfect human being - hardworking, resourceful, talented, open-minded, intelligent, charming and many more qualities that make her exceedingly loveable. Cute, really, but distinctly unreal. The only realism comes from some of the tiny side characters - a rich Sindhi woman who believes in unquestionable superiority and an obsessive boyfriend who doesn't respect his celebrity girlfriend's work. Sadly, they don't really have much to contribute to the film any way.The film also suffers technically - inconsistent lighting, poor framing and choppy editing keep rearing their heads through the film. The bland background score does nothing to help it. Also, I was consistently bothered by the strange mix of Marathi and Hindi that the characters speak through the film. Why would two Maharashtrians switch to Hindi mid-sentence? Why would a non-Maharashtrian attempt to speak in Marathi with a character who very clearly understands Hindi? Yes, real life in India is multi-lingual, but there should be a certain use of logic to determine which language a character will speak and when. Of the cast, only veteran actress Sarita Joshi in the title role does any justice to her character. She has clearly worked hard on the character, and she often manages to elicit a smile. Purab Kohli's turn as a love-struck middle-class man appeals in bits, but is inconsistent. Mita Vashisht is endearing, but her performance strikes many a false note. Raj Zutshi as the fashion designer is over-the-top, but when is he not? Nidhi Sunil as the supermodel with a heart of gold struggles with her part.The film has been written, directed and edited by Priya Krishnaswamy - the film is quite literally her baby. While I'd laud her for the emotions that form the foundation of the film, I'd also have to be honest and say that the film rarely, if ever, rises above mediocrity in any department. I'd still go to watch her next film because she is certainly a brave director for choosing to make the kind of film she has. I'd also urge those who have a financial stake in cinema - producers and audiences - to support films like Gangoobai. But Gangoobai as a film in itself is not really a must-watch.]"
319,"[A married couple, very much in love with each other, is pulled into playing a online reality game along the lines of The Moment of Truth. Interestingly enough, the Indian version of the game, Sacch Ka Saamna was hosted by the hero of Table No 21's, Rajeev Khandelwal. Anyway, the idea, of a couple having to complete a task related to the question just answered - a truth and dare of sorts - is very engaging. Unfortunately, it all ends up being very much as expected and is topped off with a social message.My concern with films with social message is that an audience like me needs no convincing. I'm already on the story-teller's side of the issue. The people who need to watch the film are the one's who commit the crime. And even if they were to watch a film like this, would that make a difference in their behavior. Even powerful films might not have that effect, and Table No 21 isn't even hard-hitting enough. So, what's the point? Sorry, talking about the kind of crime in question would be giving the movie away.Table No 21 doesn't come off as strong enough, despite some grueling stuff that the protagonists/antagonists go through, because you don't quite connect with the characters. You know they are grey and that's a brilliant thing in today's world of black and white characters in Hindi films. Yet, you don't feel for them even when they are going through some of the most mentally cruel ordeals. Their happiness and sorrow seems fake.Some of the disconnect also seems to be because of the order in which the tasks pan out. Instead of escalating into more rigorous and painful ones. So after having gone through a major ordeal the couple's dilemma seems fake when there is a relatively simpler one comes after that. Sure, some of them are more symbolic tortures than others, yet the symbolic pain seems artificial. That in turn, could be because of some very functional performances by Rajeev Khandelwal and Tena Desae. Paresh Rawal trying to be his devilish best, doesn't help. Paresh Rawal's character's sidekick provides unintentional laughter while trying to look all ominous.So, yet another potentially interesting story falls prey to mediocre execution. Yet another topic of concern in the country sees a film that is made with all the right intentions and a lot of heart, but comes across as contrived and forced.]"
320,"[Children are curious; there is no escaping this fact. And parents, no matter how they were as children themselves, will always try to protect their children from what they believe is bad for them. Of course, 'good' and 'bad' are constructs whose definitions are as varied as the personalities of the people defining them. Acclaimed director Ravi Jadhav's latest offering, Balak-Palak, or BP, deals with this important facet of 'growing up' in a manner that is lucid, charming, honest and so much more.BP takes a peek into the lives of five young children; five friends growing up in a 'chawl', their adolescent curiosity, their escapades in this regard and the eventual effect that this has on their friendship and their respective relationships. With some genuinely insightful moments peppered with just the right amount of humour, BP is one of those films that touch your heart, without ever getting tedious or heavy.What the film also cleverly does is touch upon a sensitive subject without ever making the audience squeamish or uncomfortable. In fact, the film talks about a subject that parents and children never seem to talk about, but does it in a manner that will appeal to children and adults alike. As the title of the film does give a hint about what the film is about, I'll refrain from going into it; I'd rather you discover it for yourselves, if you don't already know.The film is helped immensely by the performances of the ensemble cast. The film features known names in Marathi cinema like Subodh Bhave, Amruta Subhash, Anand Ingale, Sai Tamhankar and Kishore Kadam. All of them are excellent, without exception. But all of them only have cameos. They are merely side players, aimed more at supporting the real heroes and heroines of the film - the children.Prathamesh Parab (Vishu), Rohit Phalke (Avya), Shashwati Pimplikar (Dolly), Bhagyashree Shankpal (Chiu) and Madan Deodhar (Bhagya) are the pillars of this film. BP, after all, is about the search for answers to the questions that these children have, their friendships, their views and their lives. All five of them are extremely talented; their spontaneity is the soul of this film. Also, their characters have been written so convincingly that you leave the film carrying them away as your own friends (or children, if that is the case.) Ravi Jadhav has to be lauded for clearly putting the children at enough ease to make them lose their inhibitions in front of the camera.If director Ravi Jadhav is responsible for the children being the soul of the film, then cinematographer Mahesh Limaye deserves a pat on his back for giving the soul a body that can hold its own visually; in fact, rarely has a Marathi film looked so good. Beautiful frames combine with the earthy sepia tone to deliver a film that looks good enough for the makers to be proud of. Special mention must also be made of the music, which gels with the film nicely. It is heartening to see Vishal-Shekhar working on Marathi films as well - they've done some of the songs in this film.Surprisingly, some of my few problems with this film lie in the area where the film is actually quite strong - the writing. While the film's simple, clean story and screenplay are excellent, I wish the film had focused some more on the parents' side of the story. Yes, the film tries to convey that parents were also children once. But the parents of the children whose story we see are hardly ever shown in the film. I walked away wishing I'd known what they had gone through. Also, the film tries hard to avoid being preachy, but invariably does end up being so in the end. Another small niggle lies in the sound - the dialogue often (but not always) has an accompanying background hiss to it that distracts, perhaps because of problems in recording sync sound.One of the reasons why I had cut back on the number of Marathi films I watch in the theatre is the fact that there seemed to be one new release every week, with mediocrity become somewhat of a norm amongst them. BP, thankfully, rises above that. It made me smile throughout, and it often made the audience I watched the film with laugh out loud. This is the kind of film that I'd insist a family - parents and their children - watch together. ]"
321,"[I must confess at the outset that I haven't read any of Lee Child's novels, so I have no inherent knowledge or fondness for the character of Jack Reacher, played by Tom Cruise in the film. I've heard, though, that die-hard fans of the books and the character felt, right from the time of its announcement, that Tom Cruise was a bad fit as Reacher; some research will tell you that he certainly doesn't match the physical attributes of the character. Well, one of the big problems with Jack Reacher, the film, is that the cinematic Reacher just doesn't come across as a character worth being a die-hard fan of in the first place.A daring murder of five seemingly random people in broad daylight leads to the arrest of an ex-military sniper who clearly looks guilty of this shocking crime. However, the murder ends up getting Jack Reacher, an ex-military investigator embroiled in the case, as the crime seems to be far murkier than what it looked like on the surface. On the plus side, the film has a constant sense of mystery about it. Not treated like one would normally expect a big-budget, Hollywood action film to be treated, the film unfolds slowly, without fanfare. So, while new facts and faces are uncovered all the time, it doesn't really announce them or dwell long on them. The background music is also surprisingly held in check, with long bits of silence embellished with nothing more than just gentle ambient sound. The result is the kind of thriller that relies on mood and atmosphere to work its charms, rather than grand unveils of a good ol' 'big twist' or two.Also, the action is a refreshing change from what one is used to seeing big Hollywood stars do in their big films. It is grittier, more personal, hand-to-hand combat and precision-sniping rather than cable-propelled, gravity-defying slambang-ery that is more prevalent in films mounted on this scale. That and its lead hero's charms make it seem more intense, less 'in your face'.However, what the film gains in terms of mood, it loses that and then some because of its writing. The plot itself is like an old-school American spy film. The screenplay has enough flaws and raises enough fundamental questions for you to poke away at it continuously in real time, while your brain is processing it. That combined with the fact that everyone seems to be taking themselves and their characters far too seriously in the film makes you want to, every once in a while, tap some character on the shoulder and ask them, ""You're kidding me, right?"" Cruise himself seems to be the only who seems to have understood what the real tone of the treatment should have been like. He has a perpetual, all-knowing poker face about him; like he's teasing the audience with the feeling that he actually knows what's going on and is playing us along for the fun of it. If that had been how the rest of the characters had been interpreted and portrayed, it could have actually made for a fun watch. The character of Reacher itself seems rather bland and uninteresting, which made me wonder why it has such a following in the first place. I guess that can only be answered by actually reading the books.The only other cast member who evokes any reaction, that too only for his presence rather than any acting skill, is the great Werner Herzog who plays a shady, comic-book-ish operator. Rosamund Pike looks lovely and performs earnestly, but even she faces the same problem of taking herself and the film far too seriously.Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie hasn't done much wrong with 'Jack Reacher'. The problem really lies in the fact that he hasn't done very much right either. The next few years will see him collaborate with Cruise quite often; his name is already attached with the next Mission: Impossible film, as well as the Top Gun sequel. Hopefully he'll get his act together in time to manage to use his larger-than-life movie star in a far better manner. Jack Reacher is the kind of film which hardcore fans of Cruise (such as myself) would quite like. Others may like it for its calm, intense and dark tone, but I don't see very many people being blown away by the film.]"
322,"[The best part about a Salman Khan film is the herd of Salmaniacs you are surrounded by. Oh, the whistles, the cheers, the non-stop cackle and overall enthusiasm. I would get through many a Salman film just to be in the middle of that  kind of energy. And Dabangg 2 didn't have even that! The crowd was surprisingly cold except for the mandatory excitement at grand-entry time and during the songs. But, usually the songs get more out of the fans. The first in this series,  Dabangg had teenage girls in the audience dancing to the background music of the final fight sequence. Here it was restricted to general cheering and hooting. Since I don't get the mania anyway, and am very unlikely to enjoy the film by itself, my only barometer is the audience reaction - which was rather underwhelming.The introductory action sequence feels like a recap of  Dabangg and you wait for something new and fun in terms of action to come up soon. You keep waiting. There is nothing new or funny about them, they are just repetitive. Only this time, the sound design does the 'action' rather than the usual camera and/or editing. In the name of action choreography, people fall here, there and everywhere in the same old fashion. In stead you are served one song after another, a few obviously inserted to give the feeling that Sonakshi Sinha had something to do. And in one she was even pitted against Malaika Arora Khan, which I didn't quite understand. Was it some way of making the contrast in terms of looks and dancing skills even more apparent?Let's not waste our breath over story, it's the same old cop, up against the goon-turned-politician. Only this one is conveniently honest so that he can be Robin-Hood-cum-Kungfu-Panda. Interestingly, the other cops too are all honest and want to do the right thing. This version of Bollywood cop though is soon amalgamating into one, only the 'star' playing him changes - from Dabangg to Singham to Rowdy Rathore this police officer is fusing together and one is difficult to tell apart from the other. That two of these have Sonakshi Sinha as lead lady and two have Prakash Raaj as villain doesn't make it easier. Of the lot, Prakash Raaj and to an extent Vinod Khanna try their best to bring life to their characters. The rest are just doing the drill, ably led by Salman Khan. Is it not disconcerting to the Salman fan that his playback singer, Sukhwinder Singh is singing his soul out while he barely moves his lips for lip-sync? How is that cool? So, Salman Khan continues to adorn his 'acting' with an attitude of nonchalance. He gets to play silly pranks which can slide by as cute.Speaking of silly, the silliest gets sillier here and you are left with no choice but give it a laugh. Yet, the dialogue and especially the one-liners, save maybe one or two, carry no weight. Not even those repeat lines given to characters in order to define them, a la 'aata maajhi satakli' or  Dabangg's own 'chhed'. To top it off the relatively funnier lines of the lot are repeated to push them down your throat and make sure you 'got' them. However, I did enjoy the language a lot. 'Clean' Hindi is indeed refreshing, even if it sounds fake and forced.I know a Salman Khan film is no place for me. But, I really do love being in a theater, especially if there is hope of a lively audience. Here's hoping it will work the next time around like it did in Dabangg. Oh yes, there will be a Dabangg 3.ps. Yes, yes, ladies (and gentlemen) the shirt comes off. ]"
323,"[The first genuine children's film that I've seen in a long time, Rise of the Guardians has its heart in the right place. Based on a book series called The Guardians of Childhood by William Joyce, the film talks about values like faith and children believing in true magic, because let's face it; childhood is the only time we do, before rationality and cynicism erode our beliefs as we grow up. Jack Frost (voiced by Chris Pine), or the Spirit of Winter, is frustrated for centuries because children don't believe in him; he has been invisible to them because of this. Meanwhile, children across the world are facing a new threat called The Bogeyman (Jude Law), who is frightening children. Enter Santa Claus and the group known as The Guardians - a group that also comprises the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny and the Sandman - widely loved characters that the Bogeyman is making children lose belief in. The idea of this film seems exciting enough; popular children's characters in new, superhero-like avatars; strategizing, grouping and fighting off evil characters like the Bogeyman. So a tattooed Santa, called 'North' by his friends because of where he lives (which also gives him a strange accent and a host of Big Foots as companions); a boomerang-toting Easter Bunny who isn't afraid to use it; Tooth Fairy with her assortment of miniature assistants; the reinvention of these characters does make for some interesting, smile-worthy moments.My personal favourite character in the film, the Bogeyman, also called 'Pitch' which is short for 'Pitch Black', makes for an interesting villain. He feeds on the fear of children, is intriguingly mischievous and has a look that places him in the grey more than in the total black. The character keeps things interesting, often transgressing into a more intense realm but never losing sight of the main target audience - children.The film is also helped immensely by some great animation. In fact, even more than the characters, what makes Rise of the Guardians watchable is the animation and a breathless camera that captures the action quite well. However, the 3D is quite generic. One wonders why filmmakers still insist on 3D, when all it does in most cases is dim a bright film. But the real problem with Rise of the Guardians is that it just isn't exciting enough as a story. While part of the trouble lies in the fact that it is aimed at children so they have deliberately tried to keep things simple, I suspect that the film will probably not be that exciting for children either. There is too much focus on Jack Frost's journey, his troubles and their resolution, than on providing a crackerjack animated action film for children. Also, the film lacks substantially when it comes to funny and thrilling moments. It follows a rather predictable graph, never once throwing in a surprise that truly excites. Also, as far as us Indians are concerned, most of us don't have an intricate connect with these characters, save for Santa Claus perhaps.Rise of the Guardians is by no means unwatchable, but it falls way short of being a must-watch children's film. This one is really only for those children who absolutely insist on watching an animated film around the festive season.]"
324,"[Update: While filmmakers have been shooting at higher frame rates for quite a while now, this is the first time that an entire feature film is being projected theatrically at 48 frames per second, dubbed as HFR for projection purposes. (Currently, only select INOX theatres and Sathyam in Chennai are HFR-ready.) Experiencing The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey in HFR 3D has its pros and cons. It works well in action sequences and in shots where there is camera movement. The higher 48 FPS frame rate means that motion becomes far smoother and action is easier to watch. However, 48 FPS also seems to improve image clarity, which often makes it easy to discern shots where the lighting is artificial and where sets/VFX are used. Simply put, filmmakers will have to be far more careful if they intend to continue using HFR in the future. More effort will be required to seamless blend live action and locations with CG. As far as The Hobbit is concerned, there will be those who complain that HFR looks 'too much like video'. For most, the overall experience will seem far more familiar and enjoyable in regular 24 FPS, which our eyes are so accustomed to. Personally speaking, I will not dismiss HFR so early on in its existence, considering that I got goose-bumps at exactly the same places while watching it the second time round in HFR, as I did the first time when I watched it in good ol' 24.My best friends are Ron and Hermione. My name, of course, is Harry Potter. But even I would have to admit that 'The Lord of the Rings' is arguably the greatest bit of fantasy writing in history. Brought to life by Peter Jackson's stunning vision in the form of his cinematic trilogy, the films themselves occupy a rare pedestal when it comes to films adapted from literature. Now, Jackson is back. With the first of his trilogy of films based on The Hobbit, the prequel to J R R Tolkien's most famous epic, Jackson transports us back to the magical Middle-Earth; a world of dragons and Dwarves, of wizards and Orcs. A 3D world of fantasy and adventure, one so breathtaking that it engulfs you, if you are willing to let go. Bilbo Baggins the Hobbit is happy in his hole and his world, until adventure comes knocking in the form of Gandalf the wizard and a motley crew of Dwarves. As we are introduced to the conflict in the Dwarves' history and why this journey is necessary for them to undertake, the reluctant Bilbo is drawn into it as well, and the barmy pack of characters set off for an intriguing hunt for gold and the pursuit of the dragon Smaug. Linear and fairly simplistic in its narrative, this first film primarily acts as a preamble for the grandeur and excitement of the adventures that the two subsequent films will doubtlessly hold. As Gandalf mysteriously tells Bilbo, ""I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure..."" what he is really doing is asking us, the viewers, to join him in the world that Tolkien's and Jackson's respective imaginations have created.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is primarily held together by bewitching imagery embellished with remarkable 3D; the film virtually transports you to Middle-Earth. The eccentric characters and the comic tone of the film are charming, and are helped greatly by the performances. Martin Freeman takes little time to shake off any image you have of him as Watson from BBC's contemporary Sherlock adaptation and slips into the role of the younger Bilbo with ease. His mannerisms and expressions are perfect, and infinitely more likeable than that of Elijah Wood, who appears in a very brief reprisal of his role as Frodo. For hardcore LOTR fans, there are also cameos by Elrond (Hugo Weaving), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) and the likes, not to mention Andy Serkis' deliciously twisted, motion-capture return as Gollum. My personal favourite, of course, is Ian McKellen's Gandalf the Grey. The thespian, as always, brings that air of mystique and indefatigable character that is Gandalf the wizard. His disappearances and reappearances bring about a sense of alternating loss and reassurance, of magical involvement with Bilbo and the Dwarves who depend so much on the towering presence that the character has. Undeniably, the film works more to make you reminisce about the far more frenetic and heart-pounding experience of the earlier trilogy, because the film suffers from one big problem that is hard to ignore when you gauge it objectively. While personally, the leisurely pace of the film didn't bother me because I enjoyed the vicarious fantastical experience that I was offered, there will undoubtedly be those who will find the pace of the film tedious. Only those truly taken in by Tolkien-verse will fully be able to appreciate the film. Whether the film will work for you or not depends entirely on how much you like involving yourself in the experience that is cinema.The Lord of the Rings was a novel just shy of 1400 pages, and it took three movies to make a respectable cinematic adaptation of it. The Hobbit, in comparison, isn't even 300 pages long and is still being made into three movies. Crudely put, each 'Hobbit' film has just about one-fifth of how much each LOTR film had. The choice to make three films out of the book, then, seems more financially driven than creatively. After all, each film is most certainly going to rake in billions worldwide.But those concerns are for the practical, the rational and the cynical. For those who love living characters and mentally inhabiting places of enigma and fantasy, An Unexpected Journey works well. The songs of the Dwarves, the quirks of our lovable Hobbit, Gandalf's immense aura and the obstacles that they face along their journey will enchant you. Jackson's assured hand at recreating the world that he is so clearly besotted by more than most, makes some scenes and set pieces truly stand out. The familiar background score, very reminiscent of the LOTR films, aids further in making you live that world.Also, what the film really does is set things up nicely for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and The Hobbit: There and Back Again. In the larger scheme of things, when one wants to revisit the Tolkien-Jackson universe years later, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is where they would start, and it is a worthy introduction to the world of magic and adventure that they will be sucked into over the nearly 20 hours of cinema that they will eventually experience.]"
325,"[With an enviable filmography that underlines his terrific versatility, Ang Lee's cinematic adaptation of Yann Martel's Man Booker-winning novel Life of Pi, was easily one of the marquee films of the year, especially once the trailers of the film were unveiled. A gorgeous, visually stunning film that tries hard to retain the essence of Martel's novel, the film does succeed on that count, but only in some measure.Pi Patel, who seems to have an enchanting story behind every facet of his life, starting with the one behind his name, spends the formative years of his life growing up in idyllic Pondicherry. A fascinating boyhood, that includes devouring the works of Camus &amp; Dostoyevsky and a unique tryst with religion amongst other things, is uprooted when his family decides to set sail for Canada, for good. Disaster strikes on their voyage, however, and Pi is stranded on a lifeboat, mid-ocean, with just a rather large, carnivorous feline and his spirituality for company.Make no mistake - with the best use of 3D since Hugo and with some truly exceptional CGI, Life of Pi is a sumptuous visual treat. Jaw-droppingly beautiful frames abound in the film, enhanced with a subtle, melodious and haunting background score. Life of Pi is a complete victory for both vision as well as execution, as far as recreating the world from Martel's book is concerned. The alternating rage and calm of the sapphire-blue ocean, the hypnotic sunsets, the nocturnal marine bioluminescence, everything visual in the film is a work of art.The peak of this is the tiger, which takes CG in cinema to an astonishing new level. Fur has historically been the toughest detail for animators to crack. Here, the fur that embellishes those beautiful, strong sinews is perfect. So realistic is the tiger in this film that, apart from a few chinks vis-a-vis scale and perspective, it is nearly impossible to tell that it isn't real.That said, Life of Pi is by no means a perfect film. It takes a while to get used to Irrfan (adult Pi) and Adil Hussain's (young Pi's father) horrendously awkward, fake Indian accents. It dampens the otherwise excellent performances from the two. Also, Ang Lee seems to have pushed himself in a corner attempting to direct so many actors from such varied nationalities in the same film - some of the side characters, in particular, are extremely wooden and unconvincing. Tabu, in a brief role as young Pi's mother, has a calming presence. Suraj Sharma plays the shipwrecked Pi, and he does a good job of it. But the non-CG cast doesn't hold a candle to the tiger with the charming human name - discover it for yourself if you haven't read the book - who steals the show.But really, the reasons why the film didn't meet my expectations were on a different plane altogether. Apart from all the hype this film has generated the world over, one of the reasons why I was really looking forward to this film was just how topical and relevant it is right now, particularly for us Indians. With two high profile deaths in the recent past, those with opinions and a medium to voice it spoke out loud, invariably with extreme views on each, particularly with respect to religion. But the opinions that were heard were, at the end of the day, minority opinions. The truth is that a majority of us are still grappling with what to make of God and religion. Life of Pi, the book, has the power to at least give our own views on religion some food for thought, to set the ball rolling so that we at least consider discovering for ourselves just why this essentially human construct has the power to sway minds the way it does. I went in expecting Ang Lee to achieve that same effect via cinema, and I walked away a tad disappointed. The task was daunting, no doubt, but it seems like Lee and screenwriter David Magee played it too safe with the issues they chose to concentrate on and the ones they chose to skirt. There is so much to like about Life of Pi, the film, that I would recommend it to anyone who loves cinema. But if the film manages to evoke some curiosity about the book and inspires at least a handful of people to actually read the book, delve deeper into the philosophy behind it and then question what they really know and feel about God and religion, that would be the real victory that Ang Lee would have achieved with what could have been his magnum opus.]"
326,"[I like to look to draw positives from every movie; the positive I drew from The Collection is that at least the worst film I've watched on the big screen this year isn't an Indian one. The Collection, by sheer virtue of its genre, caters to a very niche audience. After all, not many people like to spend an hour and a half watching body parts being dismembered, human beings being tortured with sharp steel jaws and spikes, hairy tarantulas walking over a girl's face and the likes. Such people should any way stay away from films like this and others of its ilk. But films of this genre do have their hardcore, loyal audience. Though I don't particularly belong to that category, I do enjoy blood-and-gore on screen, when done well. In fact, I actually liked the first installment of Saw, a 'seminal' film in this genre, if I could say such a thing. The further films in the series went from bad to worse, but that is another story. Or Eli Roth's Hostel for that matter, another film that I quite enjoyed for its B-movie indulgence. From Dusk Till Dawn is another film that comes to mind - though it was about vampires, it was equally gory.Here though, I doubt even hardcore loyalists will draw anything at all from The Collection. A random assortment of torture and murder scenes with no regard for space, time or logic, this is the kind of film that makes 82 minutes seem like eternity and then some. And it isn't just the wanton castration of human bodies that is the problem. The excruciating non-imaginativeness of every scene and situation without even the semblance of an effort to inject the slightest credibility into the treatment makes you almost wish that someone drove a rusty steel spike through you instead. At least your own torture would end then.All films, good or bad, have a 'story'. This one does too; a particularly silly one. Through a montage of newscasts, we are introduced to the fact that a violent serial killer is on the prowl - one who kills in numbers at random locations and then abducts people from the scene, their whereabouts completely unknown after that. Inevitably, he abducts a girl, which then sets off a chain of events that lead to a group of men and women trapped in an abandoned hotel that is actually a maze-like deathly lair belonging to our masked serial killer. His barbaric instruments of torture and death are all over; tripping over a tiny thread can cause god-knows-what horrific contraption to skewer you.It doesn't help that firstly the writers and director, and then the cast, take themselves way too seriously. Had they chosen to go Robert Rodriguez on this film, it could actually have made for a hangout movie; where friends can laugh and snigger while the people involved with the film laugh at themselves as well. No such luck here. Everyone clearly believed that a masterpiece was in the making. The cast is full of familiar faces, but not familiar names; they are all bit actors who've made fleeting appearances in big movies. On1 some level I actually felt bad for them. They clearly were under the impression that this is their big break to stardom, which it is most certainly not. The Collection is supposedly a sequel to a cult horror film, The Collector, which was also directed by Marcus Dunstan, director and co-writer of this film. I haven't watched that, and if it is anything like this, I'm glad I haven't, because The Collection scrapes the bottom of the cinematic barrel.]"
327,"[If I get bored out of my mind watching such films again and again, don't the makers get bored of making them again and again. Maybe, it's because each team/person doesn't make as many as I watch. Fortunately. Khiladi 786 is yet another one of those painfully non-sensical, supposedly comic ones that you'd hesitate calling a film.Khiladi 786 actually makes it too easy for a viewer to rip it apart. Every department is so awful at its job that you could begin anywhere to criticize it and that would be the right place to start. From action to editing to music to acting to dialogue to choreography - all you want to do is tear-your-hair-apart, but since you can't do that you just end up cringing. So much so that I am confident I could say the same thing about the story had there been an effort to write and tell one.Do not be fooled by the initial set-up where you have a fake, macho police officer who plays Robin Hood and wants a woman to woo (Akshay Kumar); a mafia-leader called Tendulkar (Mithun Chakraborty) who has a sister (Asin) he wants to wed off; and a want-to-be match-maker (Himesh Reshammiya). A couple of lies later, you know the writers thought that's all that's needed to make a full length feature film.Can you really blame a music director/singer turned actor turned writer to not know how to develop an idea into an enjoyable story? Not that that idea was great to start with, but we barely can tolerate him as a music director. And I want to erase the memory of Himesh Reshammiya trying to mimic himself by going double nasal in a song he sang for Akshay Kumar. In addition, his attempt at comic timing and pulling faces to draw a laughter from the audience only reminds me of school plays. Also, shouldn't it be a criminal offense to create a tune that is not only annoying but gets stuck in your head? I'm talking about 'khiladi bhaiyya, khiladi bhaiyya, khilaaadhi' which is repeated often enough in the film to get on your nerves and shamelessly flaunts its existence after you are out!Anyway, it's a shame to see Mithun Chakravorty and Raj Babbar in such pithy, meaningless roles. Even if it has all kind of Gunda references for the former. And actually, it's a shame to see even Akshay Kumar put in his all for this one. Asin gets to play the same-old loud-mouth, brash woman. No creativity whatsoever there.A lot of the fun is supposed to be had from the 'action' in such action comedies. And usually, I complain about the camera doing the action instead of the actors or their stunt doubles. But, funnily enough, here 72 Singh aka Khiladi 786 aka Akshay Kumar is a Speedy Singh. Which means he moves so fast that you cannot see him. And guess what? Shoddy editing is used to make things go missing to 'show' this action. It is outright insulting, patronizing and frustrating - all at once. Which pretty much summarizes all of Khiladi 786 - insulting, patronizing and frustrating.]"
328,"[Talaash springs in a surprise. Not in a thriller sort-of a way. But by being more about its characters than the overall story. You don't really expect a film about a mysterious accident to be much more about how deeply damaged the protagonists are and how each one is trying to bring peace to the soul within. Given that, you still come out feeling you didn't know the characters well enough. Talaash leans too heavily on the typical assumptions you are going to make about characters given their situations. A stern police officer who has lost a dear one will behave in a particular manner. A mourning young mother is  forlorn. It gives you this much in the first few minutes and adds no more. And a lot of what goes on in the story that these characters weave together is known from the promos itself. Yet again, the promos, and overall marketing in general, of a film takes expectations in a different direction, a direction that is detrimental to the film. It is sort-of cheating calling Talaash a thriller or even a psychological thriller. For want of a better phrase let me coin 'emotional thriller' which seems to fit the bill better. Had the trailers and synopsis hinted towards the heavy emotional bent to the film, I wouldn't have spent the first half looking for the thrill. And once again, I realise how little weight the pre-release material of a film deserves. Lesson learnt.Anyways, once I figured that Talaash isn't really going to bring the thrill in a hurry, I settled down to the pace of the film. Slowly, the pace grows on you even though the story it unfolds never ever really grips you from the core. This is mainly due to the many threads opened in the first half. Is it about the accident/murder? Is it about a police officer's personal trauma? Is it about his wife's mental health? Is it about the prostitutes and their palpable conditions? Is it about an enigmatic prostitute? Well, it ends up being about all of them, but the pieces don't come together seamlessly. Also, it constantly felt like they wanted to keep things subtle but got scared into spelling things out, just in case the audience doesn't 'get it'. I do understand, a thriller needs to send its audience off in many directions to keep them distracted from what's really happening. But, the weightage each of these threads gets in the first half, does injustice to all of them. None of the sub-plots take you deeper into the characters or their situations. They all stay at a superficial level. What actually keeps you going are the performances. For a change, Aamir Khan is more Surjan Shekhawat than Aamir Khan. The only times I was reminded of the star was when he addressed his superior who looked younger than him as 'Sir'. It just felt off. To director, Reema Kagti's credit, the film is not overwhelmed by his presence. Or that of Kareena Kapoor's. She plays the teasing prostitute who has a mysterious aura about her with elegance. Rani Mukerji has a short but powerful presence. On the other hand, Raj Kumar Yadav and Nawazuddin Siddiqui entertain and create intrigue respectively. I still would prefer seeing them in films that are more about their characters.And as far as the twist in the tale goes, you can make a fair guess from the promos, a guess that is confirmed about 20 minutes into the second half. But it is pretty cool that you are still a little away from the whole truth. What I found amusing is that had this been a non-Indian film, the 'whole truth' would have been apparent a lot earlier. Now before I relent to the temptation of naming one particular psychological thriller from Hollywood that will give the movie away, let me move away from the twist. Yet, this is what won me over. I have always enjoyed stories that have a climax that gives the film more meaning than what it seemed about. In clarification, many films lose the plot in the last half hour and take away everything that they had build up till then. Whereas Talaash takes the entire goose chase to a deeper level. A level I hadn't seen coming mainly because I didn't think I'd see it in a Hindi film. I'm so used to disconnected dots staying so in films we generate. Unfortunately, the chase is rendered pretty much pointless, because it is not about the apparent chase at all. Talaash is a game of hide-and-seek that characters play with themselves. It is more an emotional tale of a police officer, a responsible father's need for catharsis, about the closure he deserves. Which is why, it seems like a film that could have meant so much more. That could have connected so much more deeply than just having a funky climax, that uses voice-overs of scenes we saw earlier to spoon-feed us.Also, doesn't a film talking about such philosophical, psychological and emotional stuff need much more profound and powerful dialogue? All this one has is dialogue that are too obviously metaphorical. So, despite performances that make stars look like humans, despite some awesome production design and camera-work, despite having potential to play tricks on the mind that the audience would enjoy figuring out, despite being more than what is obvious, Talaash remains just a good film. ]"
329,"[Perhaps the biggest disappointment about Playing For Keeps is the fact that it comes from Gabriele Muccino, the director of that little gem of a film, The Pursuit of Happyness. The former isn't a patch on the latter, in spite of the fact that the two films seemingly have the same emotional core - a coming-of-age father-son story.George Dryer is an erstwhile football star, now on hard days. He's moved to Virginia to be closer to his little son, who lives with his mother; Dryer and she are divorced. Aspiring to be a sports anchor, he spends his time making audition tapes of himself, selling his old football memorabilia to raise cash. He eventually takes up a position as the coach of a school football team, where his son plays. Amidst attractive, needy soccer moms vying for his attention, Dryer sets about trying to 'grow up'.The film struggles to establish just what it is trying to be. Is it supposed to be purely an emotional story? If so, then there are too many subplots and attempts at comedy for it to make even a minor dent on the viewer's heart. Is it supposed to be a comedy? If that is the case, then the film just isn't funny, even though it tries hard to be.The film does tilt more towards being emotional and touching, as it attempts to draw the viewer in to the journey that Dryer as a character undertakes. But it just falls flat on that count. Apart from the fact that the film is just written poorly - it has no graph in its narrative and treatment - I suspect also that it largely has to do with the cast of the film, or to be more precise, the manner in which they are used.It's strange that popular and acclaimed actors like Dennis Quaid, Uma Thurman, Catherine Zeta-Jones and the likes signed on for such thankless, pointless side characters. The characters aren't strong enough to make the audience feel that they are companions or obstacles in Dryer's personal journey, but yet are given enough screen time to test the audience's patience. So much so that this 106-minute film seems far longer than it actually is.Gerard Butler as George Dryer is admittedly appealing enough; his tousled locks and charming Scottish accent at least justify why so many women go weak in the knees around him. But even his character is as poorly written as the rest, because his behaviour in the company of these women flinging themselves at him is completely out of place. Jessica Biel as his wife churns out the best performance in the film, even though I must say she didn't particularly have a tough role to play. At various points in its runtime, the film seems more like a wasted opportunity than anything else. It has nothing to offer to the audience, save for a good-looking cast. It lacks soul; it has nothing to make the audience identify with the characters or even something to genuinely laugh at. Hard to recommend as even a DVD or TV watch, Playing For Keeps is a bland, silly film that doesn't make a point. ]"
330,"[It has been a while since audiences were treated to a truly great animation film; in no way does Hotel Transylvania change that fact. Meant as a thrilling, comic take on Count Dracula and other famous 'monsters' from pop-culture, Hotel Transylvania, directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, doesn't offer nearly as many laughs as one would have liked, nor does it manage to particularly thrill the audience much. Still, it makes for a fair watch, provided you are familiar enough with the quirks of some of our eternal 'other-worldly' characters.Count Dracula adores his daughter, Mavis, beyond belief. To protect her from the grotesqueness of mankind, he builds a secluded but lavish hotel, far from prying human eyes, where she can grow up; a safe haven for her as well others of his ilk. Unfortunately of course, Mavis is at the age where her curiosity has now been piqued - she wants to encounter humans. Meanwhile young Jonathan, a simple, lovable human not beyond the odd acts of buffoonery, inadvertently stumbles upon the castle now housing a host of creatures of the night. Tartakovsky, not a stranger to exploring idiosyncracies of outlandish, accented characters, doesn't seem to have made much progress from his Dexter's Lab days. There are some genuine smile-inducing as well as laugh-out-loud moments in the film; I don't normally laugh during even the funniest of films, but I did a couple of times in this one. Still, the genuinely funny moments are too few in number because most of them are just too predictable. I mean, how many people still find garlic jokes on a vampire funny?The film does flirt with a very important theme - that of 'them' and 'us'. The manner in which monsters fear humans, attributing them with terrible traits and alarming accessories meant to persecute and torture monsters, does make you stop for a second and wonder just how these mythical monsters emerged from the recesses of human thought. And if they do really exist, isn't it quite likely that they would be as terrified of us as we are of them? After all, and this is no secret, humans are easily the most terrible creatures in all of existence. This segregation of monsters and human beings also draws parallels between how humans, divided even between ourselves, have serious misconceptions about the 'other'. Not that one gets to dwell much on these thoughts in the midst of the on-screen shenanigans. Adam Sandler, who voices Dracula, is easily the pick of the cast. He gets the best lines and is also the most appealing character in terms of story as well as the animation. Andy Samberg and Selena Gomez as Jonathan and Mavis respectively, are extremely endearing as well, as are the other side character voices. The overall animation isn't particularly impressive, while the 3D is hardly inspiring. It seemed like the only real purpose it served is for the audience to watch and enjoy the 3D trailer of 'Oz: The Great and Powerful'. The film itself seemed largely two-dimensional in its visuals; it would possibly have had a far more vibrant feel without the dark glasses. While Hotel Transylvania could possibly make for a fun outing for children, I'm not sure if today's kids are particularly aware of the characters in the film - Dracula, Frankenstein and the likes - to be taken in by all the ribbing and tomfoolery at their expense. Or maybe I'm just not giving them enough credit. The film could make for a fun watch if there were enough people in the know, for company. Otherwise, it makes for an indifferent animation film experience.]"
331,"[People do crazy things when they have faith - whether that belief lies in love, God or anything in between.  And we shouldn't be surprised to have Yash Chopra explore this theme, when he has picked romance as the genre. Unfortunately though, only few times in the film do you want to change your belief that this is only a film, far far from reality. Very few.Sure, it might not have aimed at being real at all. But it doesn't sweep you off your feet in a fairy tale like manner either. In my mind, it will stay as the last film made by the man who made films that had characters who were human, who had emotions like you and me, who had stories that absorbed me. Nothing more, and fortunately nothing less.  Only unfortunately, this time around I have seen them too many times on screen. And they are telling me their story instead of playing it out. Shah Rukh Khan doesn't let you forget that he is Shah Rukh Khan. So much so that you can predict the expression he is going to have as a reaction to whatever just happened. Yet, the way he looks at his woman is something only the rare woman cannot be charmed by. The rest of his body language though is as annoying as it has been in almost every other film. Katrina Kaif too, doesn't allow you to think of her as a woman of great faith, like her character is supposed to be. Fortunately for her though, the rest of her character is something that we associate with her instantly, London-bred desi who has it all. Though that works for the casting bit, it doesn't say much about her acting skills or that of the writer's creativity. Anushka Sharma plays her characters bit of chirpiness and forced seriousness. But then again her character must be the most superficially written. More like a representative of today's youth. More like a stereotype of today's youth - shallow, self-centered people waiting to be taken into the depths that real life is about. You are spoonfed adjectives that you are expected to associate each character with. Samar (Shah Rukh Khan) is the stud, looks-at-death-in-its-eye, poet, romantic. Akira (Anushka Sharma) is the bubbly, exuberant, let-the-devil-care,  woman of 2012. Meera (Katrina Kaif) is the enigmatic, guarded waiting-to-be-swept-off-her-feet, whose faith in her God is as unshakable as her namesake. After this initial exposure, you are waiting to be completely sucked into their stories. But it doesn't happen. It shows promise every once in a while, but doesn't come through. The story itself is more or less predictable. And the theme of undying love is dealt with pretty much the same way. Yet, it has a few moments of charm, a few moments of genuine chemistry between the characters. It has a couple of the quintessential Yash Chopra woman-to-woman scenes that I so admire, even if they are nowhere close to the ones in Silsila or Lamhe. Yet, it has the 'aawww' for the romantically-inclined. It has moments that make you want to fall in love for the first time , all over again. But they aren't taken through to the climax. I must say though that the runtime at 3 hours didn't bother me. That is a huge plus considering I start getting fidgety around minute 120. One thing that bothers me though is that, in their attempt at making a story that rings true in today's time, the young and hip seem to define a lot of their love in terms of physical attraction. The sexual tension for those brief moments (before the camera angles and music all go melodramatic on us) while done well, seem pivotal to the relationships. This seems a little out of character in the film. A bit of that might be brought back into balance because the film does seem to address the youth of today. It is indeed telling us all to believe. To believe in love. To have hope that it will come to everyone, when the time comes.Yet, the only driving force behind recommending this film is as a tribute to the director.  Something, I'd watch for the sake of completeness - that I have tried to see all his films. But, I'd still go back to a Trishul or a Deewar or a Kala Pathar or a ...]"
332,"[If the missing vowel in 'Ajay Devgn' has been puzzling you, you must know that his company's name is Ajay Devgn Ffilms. Yes, the double-F in 'ffilms' is not a typo. Clearly, ffilm people seem to assume that India's collective IQ dives far south during the festive season. While that may not be entirely false, I am sure that at least logic and the laws of physics are a tad bit more universal than the buffoonery that some of our big, festive releases subject us to. Mildly amusing at best and capable of inducing seizures at its worst, Son of Sardaar is the kind of film that will exhaust all synonyms of the word 'silly' and come out grinning, proud of its existence for reasons that the more discerning amongst us will find difficult to fathom.The plot (I'm being mighty generous by using that word for this film) has something to do with a generations-old bloodthirsty family feud that has kept Jassi (our hero, Ajay Devgn) the last surviving member of the Randhawa clan, away from India for 25 years. He returns to stake claim on his ancestral land, blissfully unaware that while he may no longer hold grudges, his arrival has been long-awaited by the Sandhu clan, led by Balvinder Singh Sandhu aka Billu, played by Sanjay Dutt. You see, Billu walked out of his own wedding 25 years back, swearing to kill every last member of the Randhawas before he gets married. If the plot seems as old as the hills, the treatment is, expectedly, as juvenile as it can get.I must confess that when I even begin to think of the sheer volume of braindead-ery this film contains, I feel like I'm being an obsessive-compulsive maniac, because clearly there is an audience out there for this kind of film. I refuse to believe, however, that exaggerated action and comedy must necessarily entail you to treat yourself like you don't own a brain for two-and-a-half hours of your life. Not surprisingly, stereotypical jokes about the intellect of the Sikhs abound in this film. In fact, the whole film is set in a village full of dunderheads, not all of whom are Sikh. I often wondered if the point of the film was to show that anyone living in Punjab uses his brain as sparingly as the people behind this film. For a film that has comedy as one of its two primary 'pillars', the jokes are mainly banal, lent credibility sporadically because the actors delivering the lines aren't half bad. The film's other supposed pillar is the action, which is also one of the weakest bits. Apart from the fact that they don't seem to feel even slightly original and visionary, some of the execution is just tacky. CG-generated fake skies don't help in any way.If people find the film even slightly watchable, it is because of the actors. Ajay Devgn is goofy and endearing; Sanjay Dutt has a frightening yet charming air about him and Sonakshi Sinha, who seems to want to only do films that look like they'll make it into that ridiculous 'club' of you-know-how-many crores, is actually passably pleasant in the bits that don't require her to pretend like she is dancing with gay abandon. Mukul Dev, fresh out of cold storage, has a couple of silly lines that work quite well. The pick of the cast, though, is Juhi Chawla, who seems to be the only sensible character in the village-with-no-IQ.This Diwali, Son of Sardaar is clearly the greater of two evils, though there is no doubt that the film is going to entertain the audience in smaller centers to the hilt. For people who liked Rowdy Rathore, Bodyguard and the likes, congratulations - chances are you'll like this one too. For others, I think I have made the point amply clear.]"
333,"[In India, you've really got to be a 90s child to know and appreciate Top Cat, although the character and series itself harks back to US television of the 60s. I may be wrong, but I don't think that children today are very big fans of the adventures of Hanna-Barbera's enterprising alley cat character. Since Top Cat was a part of my television experience while growing up, I was mildly interested in watching a film adaptation of it. The film itself is goofy, endearing and silly fun at times, but isn't something you absolutely have to take your children for. Directed by Alberto Mar, the film was originally made in Spanish, for a Mexican audience, because the series was apparently a huge hit in Mexico. The film has nothing new to offer in terms of a plot or setting. Top Cat or TC, as he is fondly called by his faithful sidekicks, is up to his usual scams and tomfoolery in his favourite New York alley. Their lives, and indeed the life of every New Yorker goes for a toss when a new, narcissistic and tyrannical Police Chief takes over the city. TC's resourcefulness is tested to the hilt as he faces off against his newest enemy. While it really is hard to fault the filmmakers for it, Top Cat just doesn't have the enigmatic pull of other iconic cartoon characters. The humour often feels dated and I often found myself wondering if children today would actually have the patience to sit through something as innocent as the escapades of cats that seem to be no different from human beings. In fact, in Top Cat, no one seems to know if a character is a dog, a cat or a human being unless the character announces it themselves.The film does deal with universal themes like friendship and morals, as well as the dangers of submitting oneself completely to technology. Also, and this is the best part of the film and the character, the message is conveyed in a clean and honest manner. The treatment itself is absolutely no different from the cartoon series, though. It follows the same structure that an episode of the cartoon does, so you pretty much know exactly how the film is going to end.While I watched the film in 2D, I suspect that the 3D version isn't going to add much value in terms of the theatrical experience either. I hate to say this, (because they just don't make clean, old-fashioned, fun cartoons like TC anymore) but missing Top Cat, the film, is like missing nothing at all. ]"
334,"[Just how many times are we going to see an aging Nicolas Cage try and pull off what we are supposed to accept as righteously-motivated crimes, I do not know. But from the looks of it, he doesn't plan on stopping anytime soon. Stolen is precisely the kind of Hollywood film I dislike, except this film doesn't even really qualify as guilty fun, for more reasons than one can reasonably count.Will Montgomery (Cage) is a master thief; he and his team are in the middle of a heist worth $10 million when things go awry and Montgomery is the only one caught. Put away for the long haul, he gets out on parole after eight years. But the prison term has changed him. He now wants to put the 'wrong' life behind him. Life, however, has other plans for him.Director Simon West, whose filmography includes Con Air, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and The Expendable 2 amongst others, isn't a stranger to this kind of film - ones that depend on a fast pace and the star value to pull a film through, as opposed to a genuine plot. He has even found a moderate amount of success with them. However, Stolen gives such a sense of deja vu throughout, that it really becomes hard to take it seriously. So much so that I was half expecting Cage to start spewing dialogue from National Treasure and Gone in 60 Seconds.Nearly everything about the movie - the story, the look, the dialogue, the background score - has a very generic, been-there-seen-that feel to it. The lines are often clumsy and silly, the plot twists are about as much of a surprise as yesterday's news and most of the performances, including the one by Josh Lucas, who plays the main antagonist, are downright laughable. The screenplay, if I can call it that, is one of convenience. There are far too many outlandish plot holes for it to have even a shred of credibility.To be fair, Nicolas Cage does try his best to rise above the mediocre script and soulless direction. He can do this kind of role in his sleep now, but that doesn't seem to stop him from giving it his all. Besides, let's face it - he is the kind of guy who you just cannot help rooting for. But the lack of attention to detail can be seen even in the manner in which his character is physically treated - when he leaves jail, he is haggard, has more than a hint of a grey stubble and just generally looks worn out. The rest of the film occurs within a 12-hour period of that, and yet his stubble seems to grow inwards rather than out. Little things perhaps, but they matter a lot if you are trying to create a world for the audience.If there is one thing that works in favour of the film, it is the run time. Thankfully clocking in at just a little over an hour and a half, the film runs fast and gets over without frustrating the audience too much. But that is honestly just the movie-loving, optimistic side of me speaking. When the audience is always a step ahead of the filmmaker, the film is doomed. Stolen suffers from exactly that, making it nothing more than forgettable.]"
335,"[My usual problem with horror films made in the Bhatt fashion is there seems to be no underlying theme other than revenge. Given that, the story is predictable - good vs evil spirit. Scary faces and noises scaring the daylights out of badly made up women, some loophole hocus-pocus and ta-da evilness of the spirit is taken care of. With 1920 Evil Returns, there is no revenge per se, but the premise for the spirit to be evil is  so lame that revenge looks like at least a plausible reason for nastiness. The buildup towards the mystery of what might be the cause for Smriti's (Tia Bajpai) situation is slow and relaxed. While the mystical way it is done in is just about alright, it crumbles down within a few minutes and a voiceover reading out a letter, in a very unengaging fashion. And like one would expect, the writers don't seem to care what causes the spirit to cause so much harm, as long as they get to write down their contorted imagery of a haunting spirit.The imagery though is brought out well by the combination of Tia Bajpai, the special effects team and the make-up artists. Aftab Shivdasani is appropriately restrained and confused, thus expressionless and Vidya Malavade is extremely superficial in expressing herself. Tia Bajpai on the other hand, must have been exhausted mentally, physically and maybe even emotionally after some of the scenes in which her character is possessed. But then, when she is not possessed, Tia's dialogue delivery is annoyingly honey-coated. So much so that you wished the parts where she was possessed were back, at least then you can feel sorry for her. Anyway, for a person who likes the thrill provided by horror, the last half hour of 1920 Evil Returns might be well worth the time spent on the film. To me it was just the disgusting kind of gory. However, I did like the basic concept of the evil spirit taking advantage of its body's sudden death and the means it uses to express how much hatred it feels inside. But too little too late. Those are concepts that can actually be explored in another story.I also liked how the possessed is out in the clear right in the beginning and there is no time spent in building up that aspect of the standard evil-spirit horror film. But, the writers got lazy and just wrote a turn of events which brought everything back to square one. Such a shame, again.Creaking doors, background music that builds up and climaxes, extra sweet, innocent lady possessed by a evil spirit who just won't let go - yep these and many more standard ingredients of a horror film trying hard to scare. It doesn't really scare, but it does get repulsive in some parts. ]"
336,"[From the earth of Punjab come people who are charmingly simple because they are open-hearted and uninhibited. We know this because of the unrepressed dialogue given to these Punjabis. Punjabis who for a change don't shout and are not dressed in loud silks. Yet, you cannot escape the lack of depth in the basic plot. I guess you can't get it all. You know the protagonist Omi (Kunal Kapoor) is going to end up looking for a secret ingredient in his grandfather's recipe. After seeing the trailers, the main reasons that bring you to the theater are - to find out not what happens but how it happens and to see that 10% deviation from your prediction of what it is going to be. You can't but resist the hope that at least something will be different because of the name Anurag Kashyap associated with it, right?Unfortunately, you wait and wait for it to happen, but it doesn't come. That small twist or that extra conflict over what has been exposed in the trailer or that 'ah-ha' moment that the film is nicely and lovingly building up towards - but it just doesn't come. It teases you every once in a while with the protagonist, Omi (Kunal Kapoor) considering to behave according to what his character is made out to be, but ultimately, you are only teased. And as with many, many films, the end is a little contrived and convenient.Fortunately though, warm performances by every member of the cast, the dialogue they are given, Amit Trivedi's music and the rugged, dusty ambiance created are the four strong pillars that Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana stands on. The chemistry between various combinations of characters is charming and the brewing romance has its own flavor of cute. From the twinkle in grandpa's eyes when he first sees Omi after 10 years to the tune the title music breaks into halfway to the dust on the walls of the houses to a lot of things in between - everything works in adding value to the experience of watching a story.However, a predictable basic plot is a predictable basic plot and can only provide only so much of a firm foundation however strong the pillars. This once, my belief that if the how you get to the end of a story is done well, the what you find there doesn't matter as much has been proven slightly wrong. For whatever Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana has achieved is because of the ""how""s going right. If only, a little of this ""how"" was also about some meat in the story part of the writing. Also, ever since the missing ingredient is revealed, I had this nagging feeling of having seen this before or read it somewhere. An internet search hasn't brought much to light except that the concept of a missing ingredient/recipe has been looked for umpteen number of times, which we always knew. But the sense of 'tune that haunts you because you can't think of the words' just won't leave me. Hopefully, it'll come soon.]"
337,"[Easily the most ubiquitous franchise in all of pop culture, a James Bond film is always an event. The franchise tilted ever-so-slightly towards the cerebral with the underwhelming Quantum of Solace. Continuing in that vein but dialing up the entertainment value by more than a notch, Skyfall, directed by the acclaimed Sam Mendes, infuses a sense of grounding and reality into the escapades of The Spy Who We Love. Skyfall isn't your usual James Bond film. The gadgetry, the Bond girls and the wise-crackery have all been toned down in favour of delivering a more emotional, personal film. This film also gives 007's boss M the longest screentime that she's ever had, which isn't a bad thing. That isn't to say that the film is particularly well-written. While the film is intriguing for the most, the writing in the last hour or so is surprisingly amateurish and tardy. Also, the film seemed to be at least two action-set pieces short. In spite of this, the film still works primarily because of Daniel Craig, director Sam Mendes, a delightfully evil villain in Silva, played by Javier Bardem and, most of all, the work of cinematographer Roger Deakins. The film dives straight into action, with 007 hot on the heels of a man who has stolen a top-secret 'list', one that is clearly headed into the wrong hands. One thrilling action set-piece later, Bond is presumed dead after M takes a call that leads to him being shot. However, the loss of her best agent turns out to be the least of M's worries, because a new threat is lurking in the shadows.Dressed in suits that fit him like his second skin, Daniel Craig's posture, his piercing, blue eyes and his rugged salt-and-pepper stubble make him the most intriguing Bond yet. There always seems to be so much unsaid when he is on the screen that it makes you root for the super-spy even more. Director Sam Mendes handles the action scenes well, the climactic sequence in particular. Though the writing is the weakest part of the film, Mendes manages to keep things continuously interesting. Javier Bardem as Silva is superb. His understated, unapologetic malice works so well because it makes him an unpredictable villain, right till the very end. Few Bond villains have been as intriguing and striking as him. Judi Dench returns as M and does a great job as always. Her no-nonsense, deadpan demeanour are a very integral part of this film, as are those almost deliberate wrinkles that add so much character to her presence.But Skyfall, in my opinion, belongs to the legendary Roger Deakins. His gorgeous frames and lighting, and his generous use of silhouettes and lens flares make Skyfall the most visually pleasing Bond film in memory. And it helps that few Bonds have ever looked as good in silhouette as Daniel Craig does. As mentioned earlier, the film could have done with a little more action. However, the action scenes that are there in the film, are superbly executed. Action works best when the VFX is camouflaged well, and in this film it almost always is. For those who are expecting a certain kind of Bond film, the kind where James Bond seems almost like a character out of an espionage-based comic book, Skyfall may be a bit of a letdown. I also got the feeling that a few members of the audience seemed to find the film a little too dialogue-heavy. However, there is much to appreciate in Skyfall, particularly for fans of the character and the genre. Skyfall, most certainly, raises expectations for the next one.]"
338,"[Any story that tells us more about our freedom struggle inspires me. On that count, just by choosing to make a film based on an event from those times puts it in the positive column. And it's not that Chittagong doesn't add to the experience through the use of other aspects of film-making, it surely does in every field, from acting to cinematography to direction. Yet, that something more is missing as was in Khele Hum Jee Jaan Se, the connect with the individual characters. There is so little you know about the personalities of the characters that Manoj Bajpai, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Raj Kumar Yadav. Jaideep Ahlawat, Vega Tamotia play that you can barely appreciate their performances. The only character whose life is given a little more detail is that of Subodh Roy aka Jhunku played by young Delzad Hiwale (instantly recognizable as the little brother from this Reliance ad). Jhunku is a self-doubting, torn-between-two-ideolgies lad and Delnaz plays out his confusion really well.It is possible that there is only too little information about the characters available that can be converted to interesting filmable material. Maybe there is so much reverence for the characters that it is difficult to connect with them. They are high on a pedestal and their addiction to their own conviction is so beyond our understanding that any attempt to identify with them just feels inappropriate. And of course, the story is about them collectively, and not about the individuals and their dynamics.Be that as it may, it is a story that we need to know. Be it Chittagong or Khele Hum Jee Jaan Se this is one chapter from our history that we ought to be aware of. Chittagong is crisper because it is shorter by over half an hour, doesn't delve much into Surya Sen's private life and neither does it have a 'top' actress to sing songs to us. On the other hand, it doesn't have the 'star' power in the traditional sense of the word, though each member of Chittagong's cast is a star in his own right. Yet, they both narrate the story almost similarly. Take your pick, but pick you must. ]"
339,"[Acclaimed playwright and theatre director, Ratnakar Matkari makes his feature film debut at the age of 74 with his film Investment, which premiered at the 14th Mumbai Film Festival, in the India Gold category for Indian premieres in competition. A film that largely remains theatrical because of the way in which the characters and scenes have been treated, I often found myself wondering exactly what the selection panel saw in the film for them to shortlist it as a finalist in the competition.The film tells the story of Ashish and Prachi, a young couple who have lofty ambitions of speeding through Maslow's hierarchy of needs even if the cost of it is losing their grounding and values. They have even higher ambitions for their adolescent boy Sohel, who they hope to groom and nurture into a politician in the future. Sohel's paternal grandmother tries her best to instill values in the child, who is an absolute brat, but she begins to see that in a world where everything is about how much you have and who you know, she seems to be fighting a losing battle. With the parents spoiling their child endlessly, along with their own aspirations of moving into a higher class of society, an incident in their lives shakes them from their roots.There isn't a doubt about the fact that Ratnakar Matkari's intentions are noble. We indeed do live in a world where material worth and social circles carry far more weight than one's innate character. Money can buy you almost anything, and with the exposure that today's children have to the explosion of media and information around them, there is a very real threat that in the not-too-distant future, society will cease to believe in the very concepts of right and wrong. Ratnakar Matkari has dealt with these very issues in his film, through the characters of Ashish, Prachi and Sohel. The film's undoing lies in the fact that he has treated it with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the audience's head.Ashish is the 'cool' dad who, as Prachi tells her mother-in-law in the film, is more his son's friend than his father, as is the 'norm' in society today. Prachi herself is gloriously theatrical while executing her unashamed ambitions, planning her family's rise in society with the machinations of a Shakespearean manipulator. Sohel is an annoying brat who has his way with his parents at all times, getting only fond looks and expensive gifts for his unbearably obnoxious behaviour. These characters have been painted with such broad strokes that they almost stand out as caricatures. In spite of having a competent cast with names like Tushar Dalvi and Sulbha Deshpande, the performances of the cast are over-the-top, which contributes to the film seeming even more theatrical.For this story to succeed cinematically, it needed a far more subtle approach. The characters, which no doubt are rooted in the real, end up seeming unreal because of the treatment. Also, even technically, the camerawork makes it seem more like a filmed play than anything else. The screenplay itself is rather loose and begins bordering on the inane towards the latter half of the film. Investment thus ends up being a little like a Madhur Bhandarkar film albeit with a cleaner, more relevant subject. It might work as a weekend afternoon TV watch and those who subscribe to the rather strong stereotypes of the characters in the film might even enjoy it. But for most, the film's extremes will make it a tedious watch.]"
340,"[Some flaky, lame dialogue about truth and its incompatibility with the media. Blink. Samar (Emraan Hashmi) a reporter who just quit his job, gets a deal that is too good to be true. Blink. Emraan Hashmi-Neha Dhupia song. Blink. Emraan Hashmi-Sagarika Ghatge song. Blink. Interval. And all of this in a not so good way. What follows post-interval then happens all too quickly and doesn't manage to create interest that has gone in the negative with the first half. And somehow all of this ends up in a lecture to the audience about how we cannot handle the truth. Isn't that like the lamest excuse for any producer to make a lousy product? That's what the masses, the customer wants. You see, he doesn't like good things - honest reporters, non-sensationalized news, good films, he's such an idiot after all. So, here's the solution - let's make him consume mediocrity. Interestingly, despite having such an attitude towards its audience, the makers have chosen a topic recently attempted by Rann, the behind the scenes of a news channels. Nothing too shocking comes out of this attempt either. I would have brought up Wag The Dog but that would involve saying Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro in the same breath as Emraan Hashmi and Aditya Pancholi. So, I'll keep my peace. Speaking of which, the actors do whatever they have to take the movie forward. You don't feel sorry for anyone, nor do you feel terrorized by the power of the villain. The one good thing that you get out of Rush is Murli Sharma's character and the way he has played it. A delight! The women, Neha Dhupia and Sagarika Ghosh, look great but don't get a whole lot of room to look anything but fake. Yet, it does feel like this theme has a whole lot left unexplored. Another director, another writer, other actors, another film. ]"
341,"[Did you know? The rich - both honest and corrupt - can love too, so what if they have money, they have a heart too. Baah! That is what Ajab Gazabb Love harps on. So, we have Madhuri (Nidhi Subbaiah) who carries fancy bags, struts on fancier shoes and has clothes that  seem to be wanting to make a fashion statement claims to hate the rich. If that isn't superficial enough, in a scene later in the film, she refuses to take money from her family while continuing a lavish lifestyle as a sociology student that the same money seems to have bought. If that weren't enough a very rich Rajveer (Jackky Bhagnani) falls for her and HAS to lie that he's poor for she ofcourse, hates the rich. That's how you juice the comedy out of this romantic comedy.You wonder who Ajab Gazabb Love is targetted at. It couldn't be for the economically not-so-well-to-do because all it does through the film is make fun of the poor. Of course, it isn't so directly, it is masked under making fun of rich family who are compelled to behave like they are poor. And all this because of course, the script is all about the hundred other lies to cover that one like that Rajveer initiated.Not one scene is devoid of pretentious melodrama giving the whole film a spoofy feel. A spoof of what, you wonder. Hindi films? Really? If that is the serious intention, it so didn't fit whatever can be called the story. The melodrama is brought to you by some extremely over-the-top acting by the support cast led from the front be Kirron Kher. Darshan Jariwala tries to bring in some calm and Arshad Warsi does make an attempt with a mix of his comic timing and a south Indian accent.Nidhi Subbaiah has an extremely regressive and shallow role to play and she does whatever she can with it. Jackky Bhagnani starts off fine, but soon enough it becomes the run-of-the-mill mush typical of a movie that stereotypes so. However, there was one loud, hearty laugh by what seemed like 100% of the 20 people watching the film when Jackky oh-so-dramatically makes a serious 'sacrifice' dialogue and ends it with the most ridiculously lame line possible. Not that there are too many of other kind of lines. But this one was hilarious because it was so predictable. And of course, your patience with unpredictability is tested when you are subjected to a song out of the blue. The choreography, music and lyrics are as unoriginal as they look in the trailers. You don't really expect too much logic in a film that falls in this genre of rom-com that is intentionally over-the-top. But, you'd think there would be some charming moments between say father and son or mother and son or brother and sister in a film that seems to have so much family in its core story. I guess that's a bit much to expect when there no 'moments' even between the lead couple of this rom-com. ]"
342,"[You see the Naxalites' point of view that the administration of the country cannot be bothered with the poorest of poor citizens. You understand the frustration of a handful of police officers who are pretty much rendered impotent while wanting to do the right thing. You wonder about right and wrong. A movie that has done all of this has pretty much done its job. Only thing is you wish you weren't distracted by relationships that are too shallow and a few songs including an item number!I really would like to know if there is some research on the positive impact of an absolutely avoidable item song in a film. Especially in a film that takes itself very seriously and expects nothing less from us. Similarly, I understand the need for an emotional base to a subject so grim as the rotting roots of the political and administrative systems of India. But, why such a half-hearted one? Adil Khan and Kabir's (Abhay Deol) friendship isn't given a base convincing enough to make us invest ourselves in their dilemmas. In fact, there seems to be no internal struggle as far the friendship is concerned, then why have it in the first place. The story could well have been told without that relationship, except for maybe the weak point it was trying to make that the situation in the naxal areas is so bad that a conscientious person would choose to be on their side over his personal relationships, in pukka Namak Haraam/Avatar style. The same flakiness pervades the friendship between Mrs. Khan (Esha Gupta) and Kabir. It also seeps through how conveniently Kabir is accepted by the Naxal movement through the film, right to the end. Esha Gupta in her short and dispensable role adds melodrama and over-acting. Arjun Rampal's labored attempt at showing restraint is too visible. While his stiff body language might go well with that of a hardened inspector, but yet I couldn't but wonder what depth another actor could have brought to his character. Anjali Patil on the other hand comes across as the frustrated and angered rebel that she plays.  Abhay Deol as usual fits into his role with with ease. The rest of the cast is balanced by Om Puri, Manoj Bajpai and Kabir Bedi as convincing influencers on one hand and uneasy performances by the actors who play ministers, senior police officers and the businessman's son. Fortunately though, all these things, while distractions do not take away from the balance that writer, Anjum Rajabali has maintained while presenting the arguments of the Naxalites. It can be argued that the law and administration system have been painted a thick shade of gray. But do any of the things portrayed about the corrupt system ring untrue or difficult to believe? Hardly. Similarly, the dialogue is written with a lot of thought and is key to striking the balance. Yet, there is that feeling that creeps in the las half hour the film of having watched something halfway through. Of course, the war is still on. But I just wish that either the whole friendship angle was completely eliminated or it was given a lot more depth that would have added many layers to the film's social message. ]"
343,"[Delhi Safari's animation is by far the most superior I've seen in Hindi films. But, at it's heart it is a true-blue  Bollywood film, where people are convinced to go against their will using songs. And if there aren't people to be convinced, characters can still break into song. The writing gets random even when there are no songs. Animals from a jungle set out to teach humans a bit of humanity. It looks like writer/director Nikhil Advani wasn't convinced that this basic one-line plot wouldn't convert into a feature length film. Almost an hour of Delhi Safari is a road film where the animals travel from Mumbai to Delhi to talk to government officials about displacement from their jungle. The road film part of Delhi Safari then becomes a series of detours into either songs or endless bickering between Bajrang, a monkey (Govinda) and Alex, a parrot (Akshaye Khanna). Govinda is his typical loud self. Akshaye Khanna's the only voice which seems to be moderated to fit the animation genre. And Boman Irani as Bagga, the bear at times does that. The rest of the cast sound exactly like themselves and that is more distracting than entertaining or engaging, especially Urmila Matondkar as Begum, a cheetah. I'm not sure we can even blame the voice artists because they are barely given dialogue that is specific to animals. The story is set with animals, but they make pop-culture references with a ton of inspiration from Lion Kingand know way too much about human world. And it's not like their situation had any dearth of making animals behave like animals would. If there is any doubt left, it is wiped out with Alex's preachy monologue.Fortunately, the detailing in the animation of the main characters' bodies are really done well. The hair and the animals' movements are created with great attention. 3D too is used really well with stones and dust being thrown our way in the opening sequence. Another sequence where a roller coaster effect has been created is great too. And there are others where the opportunity feels untapped like the flamingo dance or the hyena joint. Other than that, the background, the lip movements while dialogue delivery and in general creativity in developing an atmosphere have a long way to go. Another question that lingers is who is the target audience. Like I suspected, the story line and dialogue seems to be directed towards adults who can relate to the references (including a scene that implies the character is a casting couch) but the rest of the execution looks like it is geared towards kids. Yet, this is a step in the right direction as far as animation, especially 3D animation go in Hindi films. And for that it needs to be encouraged. If only, they didn't take the writing department for granted, I could have done so with a  little more heart.]"
344,"[Karan Johar tries to take a peek into the minds of the youth of today. While he does try to balance their dark and human sides, I'd still like to think there is more to our youth than the shollowness that goes with jealousy and excessive competitiveness. Even if there is an attempt to counter it with some large-heartedness and semblance of maturity every once in a while. Ultimately, the situations created are too fake to be credited with a connect to any generation's thought process.The uneven narrative makes it even more difficult to digest as a story. It's neither a fairy tale nor stems from reality for us to take it seriously. The build-up in the first 20 minutes towards an ominous event that occurred 10 years ago is trying to hard to get you interested. But various characters breaking the fourth wall and talking to you as an audience directly  is disconcerting and doesn't let you absorb the story. Between cinematic techniques, I wonder what is worse a voiceover or people talking to you through the screen, especially when it gets more than a couple of sentences. Anyway, through this medium you are introduced to Rohan (Varun Dhawan), Shanaya (Alia Bhatt) and Abhimanyu (Siddharth Malhotra)- supposedly 'stars' of the next generation. While their characters are a nice mix of black and white and raise a hope that if not profound or insightful, something mildly heart-warming and at least surprising might spring our way, A lot of credit for this hope goes to the actors. Not only do they look good, but they show glimpses of talent though it might yet to be fully exploited. It could also have to do with the fact that I thought all three of them would be mere show pieces. Student of the Year also tries to touch upon various themes. The impropriety of the stress laid on competitiveness and absolutely unacceptable parenting style being two of them. Another one that comes up is the status of people who are not-so-good-looking and not-so-rich. But these come in so abruptly and unexpectedly that they take you away from the basic love triangle brewing between the three main leads. The resolution of this love conflict itself is hardly explored, it is just stated as a fact. Ultimately, you can't help but feel that  the story tries to take in a lot more than it can chew.In addition, of course you have Karan Johar's standard  take on homosexuality. While Rishi Kapoor does grant it as much authenticity as he possibly can, I have always found Karan Johar's depiction more mocking than accepting. The songs do nothing but add to the length of the film. The choreography is lackluster, the tribute to songs and films from yesteryears via remixes don't make them any more watchable or bearable. And by the last song you just want it to be done with sooner rather than later. While I must admit that Student of the Year wasn't as bad as I expected, it still doesn't engage or have anything magnificently different to offer. The comments on the education or parenting system are to superficial to make any impact. ]"
345,"['Truth is stranger than fiction' is probably what the most creatively deficient of us would have to say about Argo. Ben Affleck's third feature as director is based on real life events so extraordinary that had this story emerged directly from the imagination of a writer, audiences would have scoffed at how far-fetched it seems. In 1979, revolutionaries in Iran stormed the US embassy in protest of the US custody of religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini, a wanted man in Iran. As over 50 US citizens were held hostage, six of them managed to escape the embassy, seeking refuge at the residence of the Canadian Ambassador. Tony Mendez, a CIA 'exfiltration' specialist was then brought in to hatch a plan to pull out those six from Iran, because every Iranian revolutionary was baying for American blood. Right from the time the film rolls, what it manages to get dead right is the feel of it - the Warner Bros logo that appears is not the shield logo that we are now accustomed to, but the one used during the time period in which this film is set. From then on, the viewer is sucked in to the grainy, dated feel of the images, the clothes and look of the actors, little details like the dilapidated Hollywood Sign in an establishing shot of LA and of course, the urgency of the actual story being told. The brisk pace and gritty tone of the film combines with its audaciously thrilling plot to create one of the more entertaining thrillers seen this year. A film that, for the most, remains faithful to the serious story of American citizens treading the thin line between life and death, without losing its dry sense of humour and its quite simple agenda of engaging and entertaining. Affleck handles the film with the deft hand of a seasoned filmmaker. Don't forget, this is the man who won his first Academy Award for co-writing Good Will Hunting at the age of 25. Structured and built like most thrillers are, Affleck manages to inject the right amount of tension at every step of the film. The result is that one can almost feel the entire cinema hall's collective rising and falling anxiety as the plan slowly begins playing itself out. Alexandre Desplat's music score plays its bit in adding to the tension.Affleck also directs the ensemble cast to perfection - Bryan Cranston as the CIA honcho handling the operation is excellent, even though the character itself isn't something one hasn't seen before. Victor Garber's sheer presence seems to justify why he was cast as the Canadian Ambassador who willingly offers shelter to the American refugees. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are excellent as well. And even though one does see his regular twitches and sighs throughout the film, Affleck's own performance as Tony Mendez hits all the right notes. He looks convincing as the committed, sincere 'exfil spesh' dealing with his own personal demons while handling one of the most important covert operations in the CIA's history. Admittedly, the pace of the film does drop along the way, particularly when it often (albeit briefly) tends to drift into Tony Mendez's personal back-story. The film also goes on a little longer than is necessary at the end. A few minutes shaved off here and there could really tighten the screws and possibly improved the overall experience of the film. Still, Argo is a film that I would highly recommend, even though there is a good chance that you'll make a meal of your fingernails by the end of it. ]"
346,"[Just the experience of watching a film like Bhoot Returns in the theater is annoying, where the audience is so sure of having come for a comedy film masked as a horror film that it can never stop giggling. Save a few minutes in the the last quarter of the film there wasn't a minute of silence in the audience. Continious chitter-chatter and/or laughter was on because of what was happening on screen or rather because of what was NOT happening. The plot barely moved an inch in the first half. Night turned into day and day turned into night, with the nights getting longer but the material stayed pretty much the same. The attempt at replicating the Paranormal Activity effect again was superficial and quite plainly didn't work. While days passed, the dialogue was outright hilarious because it was so inane. While some of it might have been intentionally comic like say the hide-and-seek sequence, but it looked all too silly. For a change though background music, albeit loud, had been used a little differently and created a tiny bit of tension. The use of 3D on the other hand, was rather comical. It was employed either to give a wide-angle effect or to make items in the foreground obstruct the view to things/people in the background. While Manisha Koirala did a decent job of being scared, her character Namrata is disturbingly not your standard  loving mother. Even if a mother is self-centered, it is difficult to imagine her yelling at her child who is so obviously in need of help. The rest of the cast was just about okay but the dismal tele-marketing kind of dubbing for Madhu Shalini was extremely distracting. Not to mention, the only reason for her existence in the film seemed to be to add some X factor, for there's nothing she, as the possessed child's aunt did that either parent couldn't have done.Personal judgments and role definitions aside the much advertised horrifying climax was a bit too uncomfortable to digest. And maybe that was exactly the aim of the film - to make its audience uncomfortable at the very thought. Yet, it makes me sick to even think that there might be people out there who are okay with what the conclusion implies. My usual complaint about having child artists play roles of possessed humans stays though, I guess, I can be relatively relieved that it is kept down to just one sequence which was not that intense either. While one can thank Mr Verma for keeping the film short at 90 minutes, the re-return of the Bhoot seems imminent. And that, I am certainly wary of. ]"
347,"[Makhi is a dubbed version of Telugu film Eega. Since the movie has already reviewed by Harish, I would like to point you to his review. Thank you!]"
348,"[What? Was? That? Again, just to see if I can rid myself of the sense of bewilderment, ""What WAS that?"" I can understand the need to experiment and add quirk to a love story that is as simple as it gets. But doing it while maintaining the age-old norms of Bollywood, how much ever spoof-like it was meant to be, just didn't work for Aiyyaa. Aiyyaa is slow, long and tries its best to test your patience. I know, I should be giving the film some benefit of doubt because of the projection issues that the screen I saw it in had first in about 40 minutes and then a second one in another 10 minutes, which was after a 20 minute delay to begin, and following which the show was canceled. So, I watched the film all over again at the next show. Yet, I am willing to go out on a limb and say that the sheer absurdity of the last half hour is worth another ""WHAT WAS THAT?""Yet, I don't write the film off a 100%, just because of the basic idea. The idea of attraction experienced by a woman because of here sensitivity to smells. Love at first sight has always intrigued me. I have always wondered what ticks. I have always imagined communication through eyes and other senses rather than logic or brain playing a role in this one. And then there was this show on either Discovery or National Geographic that was about how smell plays a major role in how couple interact with each other. And thus the concept that Aiyya uses is fairly engaging as the one line plot. But boy, has director Sachin Kundalkar overdone it. Anyway, he seems to be enamored by the miraculous sense of smell considering his Marathi film Gandha had three shorter stories connected using the theme of smell. But by the time you have seen Rani Mukerji heave while closing her eyes for the 10th time, you've had enough. For want of a better phrase and over-generalising it way too much for my own taste, Aiyyaa carries a heavy dose of Marathi film sensibilities (barring likes of Deool, Natarang, etc)Not that that is the only complaint against Aiyyaa. The loud, forcibly quirky characters that Meenakshi (Rani Mukerji) is destined with as her Marathi family, get on your nerves in the first few minutes. Amey Wagh, Jyoti Subhash, Nirmitee Sawant, Satish Alekar - all well known in the Marathi film industry are made plain weird to add to the whackiness element that the director seems to be shooting at. Well, it was an annoying kind of whacky, not the kind you grow to enjoy. And let me not even get started about Maina's (Anita Date) over-the-top, unfathomable derangement. The mockery of people who don't look normal is used yet once again to bring out a few laughs. Rani Mukerji herself is barely tolerable in general, but is especially far from that too when she does her usual shrieky self in monologues. And couldn't anyone in this heavily Marathi crew point out that just exaggerating the ph, ai, sh while speaking English and punctuating Hindi with 'aiyya' and 'aga bai' does not make for Marathi accent. Moreso, considering that she is a nearly naive Marathi girl from Pune was the basic theme of the film. Yet, I do commend her for experimenting with this script. It's a risk and it might have failed, but that she took this risk is admirable. Also, she adds to the list of lead ladies bringing size 8-10 back in fashion. Unfortunately, her depiction of the physical attraction a woman experiences comes too late both in her performance and the story/film to add any value other than make the film look even more ludicrous. The juvenile symbolism makes it even more laughable. The climax is another box of weird worms and simplistic Bollywoodization (yeah, yeah spoof-shphoof).I have read the same synopsis at a couple of places to describe Aiyyaa, something that includesBollywood icon Rani Mukerji plays Marathi girl Meenakshi in this delightful 'Amelie'-style comedy.I just hope this isn't the official synopsis. 'Amelie' style? Really? Such comparisons should be left to the audience, shouldn't they? Also, is that what the makers are admitting to? And I guess, I have to add, having loved almost everything Anurag Kashyap has associated himself with, I never thought I'd ever say this to any of his products, ""aga, aai ga!"" (MUMMY!!)]"
349,"[Rian Johnson's Looper, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, is a thrillfest of a film - fast-paced with twists and turns that hook you by the minute; so much so that in all of the time you spend on the idiomatic edge-of-your-seat, you may overlook some serious screen-writing flaws and plot holes. Still, considering that it is a sci-fi film based on time travel, getting an airtight script is a near impossibility, and Johnson's deft direction doesn't give you enough time to dwell on any of the flaws longer than the time it takes for the next cut.The fun-and-games begin with a voiceover - Gordon-Levitt's - that introduces you to the concept of a 'Looper' and sets the context for the film. In the future (2074 to be precise) when time travel is invented, it gets instantly outlawed. It is then used only by the mob and for one specific purpose - people they need killed are sent back in time 30 years (2044, which is much of the 'present' in the film) to be killed by a Looper. Gordon-Levitt plays Joe, a Looper, who's life seems rosy until his future self - Old Joe, played by Bruce Willis, is sent back to be killed by him to 'close the loop'.The concept of time travel is tricky, because there are virtually a gazillion ways in which one can go wrong when depicting it on screen - simply because there is absolutely no point of reference for it. Rian Johnson's time travel raises a lot of fundamental questions as well, which would be considered plot holes if it weren't for the fact that he has given a number of interviews clarifying these holes. But directors' interviews aren't part of the film, so the flaws still stand. Also, Gordon-Levitt's voiceover popping up every once in a while to clarify things is the biggest problem with this film. It is a directorial and screenwriting flaw, the fact that they couldn't suck the viewer into the world of the film and blow their minds without resorting to something as un-cinematic as a voice-over. Even as it stands, the film does blow your mind. But it could have been taken to the next level if they could have achieved it without the VO.But as mentioned earlier, these flaws are swept away because of the merits and the pace of the film. Rian Johnson's depiction of the future is grungy, with unlikely technological advancements kept to a bare minimum. Tiny details like a new narcotic that is consumed by dropping it into the eye add to the world that Johnson creates. Also, the non-linearity in the narrative is handled with remarkable maturity - no cheap tricks to heighten the drama in repeated scenes shown from different points of view. The film also has an unlikely family angle to it that really sets it apart from regular action flicks.Gordon-Levitt is extremely convincing as the Looper who is trying to hunt down his future self. The prosthetic changes to his face do take some getting used to, but you eventually settle into it, since the point of them is to increase his similarity to Bruce Willis. Willis himself has done well with his deadpan action and dry wit. Emily Blunt is excellent as well, even though I can't even begin talking about her role here, because it will just give too much away.Looper is the kind of the film that will demand a second viewing just to see if your mind is equally blown the second time, but it doesn't lend itself well to too much deconstruction. The mysteries and plot details that beg questioning will mount the more you analyze it. But it is also the kind of the film that will spawn a lot of interesting forums and analyses on the internet - like all such movies tend to do. But then isn't that the point of cinema anyway, to open up discussion, to be ripped and torn apart so that those of us who live cinema can fuel our hunger? Looper must be watched, enjoyed and debated.]"
350,"[Gangster Noir. Coppola and Scorsese showed us how it's done. Tarantino turned it on its head. And every once in a while a Hollywood director comes along and screws it up, sending us running back to the masters for solace. For some reason, I expected writer-director Andrew Dominik's latest film, Killing Them Softly to belong to the latter category. My expectations dove further south after a prominent director, the maker of one of this year's most loved and talked-about Hindi films, tweeted saying that it was one of the most boring films he had seen. How glad I am that I watched the film anyway.Killing Them Softly is easily one of the sharpest, smartest-written films of the year. Dialogue-heavy, yes, but at no point does the film get boring. Also, the film has one of the best-ever endings seen in recent times.Two small-time thugs, played excellently by Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn, attempt a heist a little above their station - robbing a poker game involving the mafia - after an older operator manages to convince them that someone else would take the fall for it. The amateurs, however, don't know just what they've gotten themselves into. A professional mob enforcer, a hitman - Brad Pitt, dressed in all black, effortlessly 'cool' - is roped in by the Big Guys to look into the matter and bring the perpetrators to book, so to speak. The razor-sharp dialogue, mostly tongue-in-cheek, manages to keep the long character interactions interesting at all times. And every once in a while comes an action set-piece that can make your jaw drop. Interestingly, the film's timeline runs with the Barack Obama - George W. Bush Presidential race, the run-up to Obama eventually being elected President of the United States of America. What that does is give every character and every line a context. So there is generous talk of the recession hitting even the mob business, falling rates of pro-assassins in these hard times and of course, the fact that in the US, ultimately it is all about the money. What the film really gets right is the feel of it. The frames aren't picture perfect; they are meant to be gritty. Every shot in the film has primarily been set up to create the mood. The cool it eventually oozes is a by-product of having good actors delivering great lines without making it go over the top. Brad Pitt is first-rate as the ice-cold, no-nonsense hitman roped in by the mob to look into the issue of the heist. It is the kind of role that harnesses Pitt's natural charm, and his deadpan expression goes well with his uber-cool look. He makes a late-ish entry in the film, and his larger-than-life persona is largely kept in check, so that he doesn't come off looking like the 'hero' of the film. James Gandolfini as the expensive hitman from out-of-town, now well past his prime because of his alchohol-and-hooker addiction is excellent as well. Also good to see is Ray Liotta as the gangster who runs the poker game that eventually gets robbed by the amateurs. However, it is easy to understand why the director I mentioned earlier didn't like the film. Indeed, there will be more like him. And you'll know in the first ten minutes if the film is going to work for you or not. Right from the word go, the lines mouthed by the characters are sharp quips meant to evoke a certain amount of quiet mirth. If you aren't smiling at the coolth of it all from the beginning of the film, there is very little else that you are going to like about it apart from some well-shot action portions, which are few in number in any case. But if you are drawn in from the start, then this is the kind of film that you would be itching to watch again.]"
351,"[A movie is often considered a symphony of the audio &amp; visual medium; and sure enough the auteurs have always striven to tread on a path between the said &amp; the unsaid in order to keep us in a trance. To achieve that feat in Thandavam, a self-proclaimed unusual revenge saga of a blind man, A L Vijay employs everything in the rule book &amp; that could precisely be the reason for its inability to interest us.Looking at Thandavam on the whole, the crucial problem with the film clearly lies in its immature treatment. Sure the premise of the action thriller is something even an infrequent film viewer would appreciate. But when the film sets out to express itself, what clearly could be and had been registered through the visuals gets re-registered again and again till one feels nauseated by the events. As this redundancy gradually distances the audience for the silver screen, the age old formulas to invoke emotions becomes too tiresome &amp; juvenile to warrant our attention. Close to the release of the film, a trailer was released by the Thandavam team. Splashed all over the media, it started off with a song sequence followed by a caption stating 'a love story'. It was then followed by snippets of the film's different scenes with subsequent captions like 'a story of friendship', 'family story', 'revenge story', 'fun story', etc; and at the end of the trailer, they claimed it to be 'a complete entertainer'. As any Actor Vijay or Salman Khan film goes by, the trailer simply displayed varied ideas and values like how the 27 states displays its props during the Independence Day parade. As demeaning as it could be to call it entertainment, the trailer otherwise is a perfect showcase for what the film stands for.  The film begins as action thriller interlaced with unintentional comedy, at the midpoint of which it discards that &amp; becomes a complete romantic film. Long past the expiry date of the romance when the movie limps towards the end, it suddenly gets the urge to be a revenge saga again. All this while the main selling point of the film that the protagonist is a visually impaired person, is used only as a second rate prop. With such obscurity looming large on the screen, one wonders who really is the visually impaired - the writer or the protagonist.]"
352,"[Continuing the rather puzzling trend of Malayalam films bearing English titles, Ranjith Sankar's latest film, Molly Aunty Rocks, is a simplistic, occasionally enjoyable film whose primary USP is a set of decent, smile-inducing performances.Revathy plays Molly, popularly known as Molly Aunty, an NRI who has been living in Kerala for the last two years, with her husband and children still in the US. She's upright, law-abiding and slightly comical; a bank employee who is progressive in thought and is used to the manner in which things are done 'by the book' in the US. Thus, she often gets into tiffs with people who, like all of us here in India, aren't too worried about doing things the 'right way'. Molly Aunty Rocks maintains a feel-good, frothy sense throughout. Molly runs into a bunch of situations and handles them in a manner that is intended to make the audience smile and cheer even. However, one can't help get the sense that everything has been too sanitized. The characters that one can identify with the most are her family members who have a problem with the way she is, because that is definitely the most likely reaction one would have to a character like Molly. However, there are a number of characters that seem to go out of the way to help her out, which does make one wonder why. One gets the feeling that in a real life situation, it would be strange for a character like her to have so many well-wishers.The biggest flaw in the film then is its screenplay. The whole set of events that happen in the first half and much of the second half were supposed to build up suspense and end in a revelation that was supposed to clear the audience's doubts about Molly's motivations. However, the build-up is so weak that it is only after the revelation occurs that the audience realizes that there was supposed to be a suspense element in the first place. Also, the film seems way too long for its own good. At a time when Malayalam films are clearly trying their best to compete with World cinema, the right pace for a film is absolutely critical for it to truly hold the audience.As mentioned earlier, the strength of the film lies in the performances. All said and done, Revathy is pitch-perfect. She is one of the finest actresses India has, and her performance here proves it. Prithviraj makes a late entry into the film, but he is excellent. A fine, young actor, he makes the role his own. The supporting cast of the film does a good job.If only the characters had been fleshed out more, with a lot more attention paid to the little details, along with a sharper screenplay, this film could really have been a good, slice-of-life story of the struggles that one has to go through when up against 'the system' in India. However, as it stands, Molly Aunty Rocks isn't a complete waste of the audience's time, because there is some amount of fun to be had in the situations and the performances. But it isn't a must-see by any standard. ]"
353,"[The Indian mom gets her due from Hindi cinema. Finally. No this is not the educated, job-and-home juggler, modern 'aaj ki naari' (Today's woman). This is the one whose full-time job is to makes homes, the one who is so humble about her 'small' business on the side that the rest of the world is only willing to dismiss her achievements.   The woman who has never found expression for her confidence, until one day a slight window of opportunity opens up. English Vinglish takes this opportunity and ever-so gradually talks to us, her family, about our responsibility to empower her. While doing so it keeps the atmosphere light and lets you spend 5 weeks with Shashi (Sridevi) and her gorgeous homeliness.Yes, I saw my mom, my nani (grandmom), my aunt, my cousin and countless other enterprising women in Shashi - warm, modest, coy, technically uneducated but sharp women. She is underexposed to the world outside and yet has a mind so broad, and an attitude so simple and clear that it would make some of the urban seen-the-world, know-it-all snots ashamed of their chauvinism. She is put down by those closest to her and that affects her more than the deep love and support that others might offer. Her pride is hurt and you see her swallow her hurt and even take blame to keep harmony. She beats herself up, for not having stuck to her ""should haves"", before anyone else could get a chance.  And yet given a chance, this meek, submissive lady can fly high if she somehow manages to find freedom.If guys out there think this a women's film because it sounds all touchy-mushy. You might want to watch it so you can empower the women in your life and see your world from their eyes.Sridevi brings out complexities within the life of a simple Indian woman with grace and elegance. Even if it were for a total of just 30 seconds, her dance is much more graceful than many of today's top actresses put together. Sure, her squeaky voice is distracting enough to make you wonder if Urmila Matondkar has dubbed for her in a not-so Marathi lilt in her Hindi. The constant stutter/hesitation and lack of confidence her character demands can seem a little repetitive. But her gorgeous eyes make up for that. And I just don't mean their shape or the way they are made up, but what they convey, the emotions they stir within. I don't know whether to thank her or be disappointed that she has made the typical housewife, larger than life.I doubt she could achieve any of this if she weren't provided with material to play with. Quite a few parts of this simple story manage to convey a lot about the relationships and their dynamics even though only a few minutes are spent on them in terms of time. I especially enjoyed Shashi's relationship with her son and the character of her spirited mother-in-law. On the other hand, the gay effeminate character is caricaturish and the charming, romantic French man is too good to be true. But, if that's what it takes to balance it off with a positive attitude towards sexual orientation and subtle, cross-border love, so be it. The other characters like say her husband and daughter were the stereotypical male chauvinist and ruthless teenager. However, we do have to realize that these stereotypes do find their place in every other household with some or the other variation. And some of them don't necessarily have an instant change of outlook within 5 minutes. I loved the pace at which English Vinglish goes about it's business. No rush, no great strides to cover lots of ground. In fact, at half-time, all you've seen is whatever you know from the trailers in terms of plot. Shashi Godbole is being put down for not knowing English. And you wonder how they are going to close all the threads in just over an hour. Yet, you haven't gotten bored. Even in it's entirety the plot has just the slightest curve in its arc. I'd have liked it better if I didn't know some of the punch lines from the trailers or they had a few more of them. Also, another slight sore point is that it does tend to get a little preachy, even as it gets masked under conversations and real-life speech situations. I also wonder how it'd have been to see Shashi do what she does while living in India, without using the American 'support' system as an anchor.With that we come to the question of the importance given to the English language in English Vinglish. On the one hand, I could get distracted by the supposed moral of the story, and the overt emphasis on the language. Because, surely an Indian home-maker in Pune, can get by without HAVING to know English and she won't lose much face either. The exaggeration is made to make a point. But Shashi's need to learn English is my mom's want to learn driving is my grandmom's drive to learn how to play the harmonium at age 75! It's not about the English or the car or the musical instrument. It's about confidence, it's about independence, it's because they didn't get to do it then, it's about being proud of yourself and finding self-worth, it's about feeling good about yourself. And for the rest of us, it's about giving them space to do so. ]"
354,"[OMG Oh My God reminds you of the coffee table conversations centered around faith, blind faith and the business of faith. It is similar to any argument you'd have between people who blindly believe in the hand of God and the misuse of that belief at the hands of the men of God. The attempt is to represent both sides and keep the arguments balanced while making its point. The frustration of the common man against the oppression of what should be done in the name of religion is quiet adequately represented. But, the happening are way too convenient and ultimately remain good in theory.At first, it seems Kanji bhai (Paresh Rawal) is a staunch opposer of the very existence of God. A non-believer, an atheist. He appears to be very close-minded to anything that the whole world has to say about faith. But, as the story moves forward you realize that his issue is more against the business that God has become and is even open to accepting a change in his attitude. All this is shown in interesting arguments Kanjibhai makes with high-ranking priests. The balance is thrown off with making mere caricatures out of these priests. The exaggeration of these cartoon-ish characters might have been necessary but painting them as dimwits takes away from his fight, makes it too easy for us to take his side. However, I saw balance in the climax. The story is taken beyond the apparent conclusion, the argument though stretched takes it to a proper culmination. Interestingly, the film is set in the most festive period of the year. The months in which we celebrate births and victories of Lords Krishna, Ganpati and Ram. Also, the questions related to existence of God itself are dealt with smartly. Believer or non-believer, you will see yourself smiling and questioning what you believe in.Paresh Rawal could possibly have done this role in his sleep. Not taking anything away from his heartfelt performance, he played it with conviction. Akshay Kumar plays a charming Krishna and does his bit by staying away from the limelight. Mithun Chakravorty despite his overtly caricaturish character brings a laugh every time he moves his eyebrow or moves his little finger - which is pretty much all he does. Most of the rest of the cast though are a pain to bear through and you thank God for Paresh Rawal being there in almost every scene. For people like me who are in almost 100% agreement with Kanji, it is easy to identify with Kanji. The question is how does this film effect people who have blind faith, who are superstitious, people who are represented by the likes of his wife. Like I said earlier this week, it's not that anyone can expect a film to change lifelong beliefs, but this one has the potential to at least reconsider some beliefs.]"
355,"[As expected, Kamaal Dhamaal Malamaal is everything we thought it would be - loud, ridiculously incoherent and annoyingly induces sleep. Yep, I strongly resisted my urge to nod off while waiting for the interval. I guess it was too loud to let me doze off.It is such a shame to watch Paresh Rawal repeat himself endlessly and try to put his heart into it. It is so frustrating to watch Om Puri be at his loudest best. It is so disappointing to see Nana Patekar come back after such a long time and have nothing to do with his character except play emotionless, which of course he does well. And it is extremely upsetting to see Shreyas Talpade reduced to shouting in the name of acting. I am not even going to venture into talking about the plot and how it doesn't make sense, about the character transformations, etc. Any effort I put in seems like it would be more than what the writers could be bothered with. The minutest interest is triggered with how good-for-nothing and shameless Johnny (Shreyas Talpade) is. But that too wears off. How long can you hold on to yelling after all? What I am left with after the film is this ordeal of course of having to review it. But also with this thought. It's easy to pass a verdict and say that such films shouldn't be made. But, what if this is the only thing that keeps these actors in the game? And the trade-off is that it also keeps these directors/writers in too. Tough call. ]"
356,"[Forgive me as I've not been an avid reader of the Marvel comics, so this review might be one of just the film. That said, I found myself hooting, cheering, laughing out loud and enjoying every minute of The Avengers, without being the comic-book fan. I did, however, read up at length about each character and their graph before the film, but even without a background study, The Avengers is a must-watch: for sheer indulgence into a world that is action-packed, entertaining and thrilling all at once. The Avengers intertwine the lives of previous superheroes (with their own movies): Captain America, Thor, Iron Man and Hulk. With Black Widow (Scarlett Johanssen) and Hawk-Eye (Jeremy Renner), they are brought together to prevent an event of global danger. Our heroes (and heroine) are tracking down the Tesseract, a cube of cosmic super-power, which was also present in the movies Iron Man 2, Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor. The Tesseract has landed itself in the wrong hands of Loki (Tom Hiddleson), the film's wily villain and also Thor's step-brother. Loki's intentions are clear - to rule to world and subjugate as King. Director of the secret international peace-keeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D, Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) is worried and desperate. He rounds our super-heroes to save the world from this feudal monster - and it's a cliche that works superbly. It holds you, makes you sit on the tiny, uncomfortable edge of the seat and rejoice/scream/cheer. The film takes no time to establish each super-hero, and through the film makes sure every characteristic of the heroes are brought in. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is sassy and suave as ever, Chris Evans as Captain America is brave and confused as the defiant World War II veteran.  The new entrants are as charming: Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk fits the part to a T, and Scarlett Johansson plays the sly Russian Spy Black Widow incorporating her personal flair to the character. Oh, but you spend roughly 10 mins of the film analyzing the characters. Before you know it, you are picked up from your seat and taken on the epic adventure that these Avengers take. Director Joss Whedon maintains an engaging pace, while the film shifts between blasting action sequences and witty repartee between characters. Ofcourse Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is at the fore-front of the humor, but surprisingly every character follows through. You are given enough moments in the film to laugh out loud and generally, have a good time. It's a balance that has been struck to perfection. Although the plot-line is formulaic and a tad bit predictable, the film does leave you spontaneously wide-eyed with its compelling chemistry between each character and the witty-dialogue/grand-action routine. The Avengers is a mammoth spectacle. And yet, in retrospect you don't feel deceived by an overdose of mindless action. Each character holds their own in the film, and is therefore a treat for those who prefer one particular character over another (Iron Man!). The 3D version adds to the grandeur of the film, with fluid camera work, you feel like a part of an adrenaline-pumped videogame. At 146 mins, The Avengers is worth every minute of your time.]"
357,"[We Are Family...hmmm the name still gave me the creeps as I entered the theater. Shrugging it off, I settled myself in for a cushy, melodramatic, soap opera - the English version of which I've seen. I wondered as I walked out, ""Does one well-made teary scene, warrant a 'good' opinion?"" I didn't have the heart to write-off a film for its thousand flaws when it managed to have one scene that touched me because it was written, performed and directed well. Even if most of the emotion is because of the way I identified with the situation, ""Oh my God! What if I'm dying and I have to tell my kids about it?"" boo-hoo-hoooo-tissue-please Ok, now that we are done with the 'credit where it's due bit', I feel liberated and let the 'ripping apart' begin!We'll start soft, just like the film. It is a mature concept and the big picture is actually non-standard considering the typical Hindi family stories. When you start watching Stepmom you feel like you have started reading a book from the middle of a chapter. We Are Family sort-of covers that gap and gives a more rounded beginning. Also, the missing backstory of the three main leads, from Stepmom, is provided briefly. And the short one or two line descriptions work perfectly. And the stage is set for a fine melodrama...or not. The performances aren't what I feared - shrieks and shrills or over-the-top. But they fail to move or get you interested, let alone involved. Mom-type Kajol; strong yet unsure, Kareena Kapoor and hunk dad Arjun Rampal show you their dilemma and the struggle, but none of them make you don't feel for them. Maybe because the characters have flaws and they are not necessarily good human beings. But they are not bad enough to hate. Awesome gray characters I've always been waiting for, but they still seem out of a book, not real human beings. And it is difficult to point out what exactly didn't work in the writing and execution of these three characters. The kids on the other hand are pretty much caricatures that are plucked from one filmy stereotype to another. Actually, I got that wrong. Not all three of them are designed that way. The little boy, has absolutely nothing to do. His middle name might as well have been, 'Haven't a clue why I exist.' The writer's cluelessness transcends  barriers of the fourth wall to haunt the audience.I don't think there was any attempt at all to make the film's events unpredictable. The trailer itself gives away the main elements of the film by way of dialogue, sequences, songs or make-up. Moreover, why would one watch We Are Family instead of Stepmom? There is hardly any value addition or Indianization. Unless you count making it with 3 kids instead of 2 and having a ""kangan"" (bangle) scene. Oops! How could I forget how they allude to the idea that woman's ultimate aim in life is to get married. And then directly go on to say that being a mother comes with the XX chromosome! Without getting into an argument about the modern woman versus the traditional idea of a woman's role in society, I'd like to say that these concepts are rather regressive. Not to mention that two women who were/are in love with the same guy are shown dancing together. I mean, I'm sure there are many women who'd get along that way, but here it wasn't convincing enough. The concept of We Are Familyconstantly reminded me of what I remember as a beautiful film, Mere Baad where Rakhee Gulzar plays a mom of four kids. It's a soul-touching film about how she goes about looking for foster parents for her kids after she's diagnosed with a fatal disease. No, We Are Family is nowhere close to being that sensitive, but I suddenly feel like digging that one out. Any pointers for where to start?]"
358,"[Welcome to the world of 'babes', one-upmanship, over-reaction. Welcome to the cut-throat world of the Hindi film industry, Bollywood. Or so you are made to believe. Heroine doesn't sink in any deeper than these two lines. However, like a Madhur Bhandarkar film, it does spend quite some time with its lead character, Mahi Arora (Kareena Kapoor). Mahi's character builds interestingly but unfortunately her story has nothing out of the ordinary to hold the film together. It's almost as if the character wasn't written but just happened to happen. It's great that Heroine picks not a typical top star as his lead character, nor is she a struggling actress who's rise we see from the very beginning. Her journey is told to us from somewhere in the middle. At a point in which she's most distraught and finds her way to a police station for a reason that is not told to us immediately and when you do find out, you can't believe the pettiness of the issue. I doubt the character or the writer/director knew why she was there. But meanwhile, Kareena Kapoor gets to insecure, distraught, failure, glamorous of course and bipolar! Though she seemed more depressed than bipolar, but hey that's nitty-gritty, right? But, the point here is that whatever Kareena is asked to do, she works really hard in getting it right. She looks gorgeous even when she is dispirited. And I mean this in a good way. She takes every opportunity she can get and the labor shows. It is not an effortless performance.The character offers her enough layers too - a woman who wants to do well in her career and is a decent human being too. But as it turns out, even if she is willing to put in her best, try everything within her control and resist from sinking low, it's not enough. And after all, she is a woman and thus is needy. There are other times, where Mahi behaves aggressively, over-reacts and takes actions the repercussions of which she hasn't taken into account. Interestingly, the only really good looking actress in the entire clutter of 'top' heroines in Heroine is Mahi. The rest, aren't half as magnificent. Yet, she struggles as a 'star', if not a beginner. For a change, you also have the male leads in sensitive roles, who have their own shades of gray, however unbaked they are. None of the other side characters add any meaning to the film except for maybe Shahana Goswami's Promita.With such textures, you'd hope the story would hold your interest. It meanders, it stretches, it disengages you from the characters. And towards the end it just gets overbearing. And at times, you feel like some sequences, especially ones revolving around sexuality, have been added just to titillate without much relevance to the story. The run-of-the-mill songs slow the film down too. The two and a half hours run-time doesn't help its case either. There is this underlying equation that Madhur Bhandarkar seems to point at, which is annoying as his audience, because it comments about the audience. While belittling the hard-work that people put in their work, Heroine implies that the entire film industry lives in a cut-throat environment where manipulation is the key to success. They do it to so their films do well with the masses. And the masses supposedly decide the fate of a film depending on the controversy surrounding it. Full stop. There is no if or but there, the question about the film's quality or content is a distant one. The audience's love for their cinema is based solely on the associated scandals. And what is poor media to do but to report on these with dramatic effect if that's what the audience wants. !?!? Really? Is that what we are? Naive and basically stupid. Whatever. What it all boils down to then is the same question we could ask about most Bhandarkar products - Is Madhur Bhandarkar's Heroine about ""Bollywood - behind the scenes"" or is it telling us the story of its heroine, her ups, downs and in-betweens? If its the former, you'd get more out of reading your city's daily edition let alone film magazines. And if it's the latter, atypically so, Bhandarkar doesn't engage despite having his heroine perform to the best of her capabilities. ]"
359,"[Boasting of a large ensemble cast and more characters than are absolutely necessary, debutante director Lijin Jose's Friday is an often meandering but still engaging effort, one that must be lauded for its sheer audacity in terms of the number of stories that are woven together.Set in the time span of a day, a Friday to be precise, the film jumps between various characters, ordinary people like you and me, many of whom have come for various reasons via ferry into the town of Alappuzha, better known to non-Keralites as Alleppey.The characters range from an irritable autorickshaw driver, a family headed by a father whose youngest daughter is to be married in a week, a childless couple who intend to adopt a young girl, a couple of hoodlums who are trying to sell some sort of exotic animal on the sly, a pregnant beggar woman with another child in her hand, and many, many more stories and characters. In fact, even as I listed the ones I did, I thought of so many more that I haven't.There are so many characters and stories in Friday that about three quarters of an hour are spent just establishing them. That is perhaps the one big flaw in the film - it could easily have done without so many of the characters and stories, and have still been just as engaging.Nevertheless, once each story reaches its own little turning point, the film picks up steam. The film then proceeds at breakneck speed as every story hurtles towards its own little ending, even as a number of the hitherto unrelated characters come together for a larger, more conventional climax. One of the problems with having so many stories running parallel is the fact that there are too many false climaxes and resolutions. I could sense some of the more fidgety members of the audience desperately wondering what exactly was going on. The narrative is by no means complex, but it demands your total attention in order to truly make sense of what is going on.The experience of immersing yourself into the lives of so many characters is made even more convincing because of the actors playing the characters. Fahad Fazil is excellent as the autorickshaw driver in need of money, who is then faced with a moral dilemma. Thespian Nedumudi Venu is pitch perfect as the hassled father of the bride-to-be, while Vijayraghavan playing the kindly police office helping them out is excellent as well. Many of the other performances, too many to list out, are fairly convincing.What really works for the film is that each of the stories depicts the life of a real person, carving out a little slice of it for the audience to savour. The parallel narrative, something that I always enjoy, adds to the overall experience. The last few moments of the film were daring, something that very few filmmakers would have attempted.While there are no standout technical achievements in the film, with the cinematography and background score being purely functional, credit must be given to the editor for handling so many stories and weaving them together without ever making the audience wait too long for the next snippet of each story. Going back to the background score, I often felt that the choice of background pieces during certain scenes was poor, detracting from the intended impact of the scene rather than adding to it.In spite of its hiccups, Friday is still a film that is worth a watch. It is heartening to see a young filmmaker have the vision to attempt something that is by no means easy and manage to justice to it for the most. Lijin Jose is a director to watch out for and Friday is a film that I'd recommend to anyone who likes being completely engaged and involved in a film.]"
360,"[Usually, 'sweet' films get overbearing and sticky because of the unreal overdose. But Barfi! carries the charm with such elegance and confidence that you can't but want to go along with it. It's not because the lead characters have handicaps that demand sympathy. The film takes you beyond the most obvious and endears you with the inherent charm and innocence these handicaps bring along with them. So much so that it makes you wish the plot didn't manipulate and that it got rid of characters who take advantage of their disabilities, however noble their intentions. You wish they didn't take you into the real world that deviates from the sweetness. More so, because they look like aberrations from the unreal and fantasy world of Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor) and then Jhilmil (Priyanka Chopra).Barfi! is as dreamy as a film can get. Ranbir and Priyanka play their characters so convincingly that you forget that the film is far from reality. Ileana D'Cruz looks lovely and bring her own share of grace. Just knowing our top-ranking 'stars' take on such challenging and risky roles is joy enough. But watching them give performances that make you forget their star status is way beyond expectations. You realize you were watching Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra when you step out of Barfi and Jhilmil's fairy tale story. There are times when the romance doesn't seem romantic enough. But when characters cannot express their feelings in words, when there are things that cannot be said, it opens up a whole new world of beautiful questions. Question marks that Barfi represents in just one scene where he breaks down. It is after you step out of the theater and your analytical brain takes over that you begin to wonder if Jhilmil was over-simplified. If it is indeed so easy to fall in love with an autistic woman? If it was necessary to bring in elements from the 'thriller' genre to this film that is mostly beautiful? Should I let these thoughts take away from the warmth the film created while I was watching it? At its core, it is ultimately your standard love triangle. Yes, there are a few films that Barfi! reminds you of - Hindi, English and silent. But, like with anything as standard as that, it's how the audience flows with the narrative that makes or breaks the film. And Barfi! doesn't let go of one chance to make you smile. Even if it is rather dark masked behind Ranbir's omnipresent charm. Neither does Barfi! let go of being melodious. The songs stay soulful and playful together. This once, I didn't mind the background score coming into the foreground and wanting to stay there most of the time. It made Barfi! the lyrical and soothing film that it is.Other than the light-hearted cloak Anurag Basu's writing garbs the sadness of the characters with, it creates an intriguing atmosphere with it's non-linear narration. The back and forth between the two years in the 70s make the film a lot more engaging, 'thriller' element notwithstanding. As the film closes and you see an increase in the back and forth between the 70s and present time, you wonder if the non-linearity is used to keep you with the tenderness that the film has created and not leave the theater feeling too bad for the characters. These characters don't want sympathy, they want to engage you in their bizarre story. The dark comedy of errors, the slapstick, the romance itself is captured in a series of captivating moments that keep you smiling throughout the two and half hours. Ever-so-slightly Anurag Basu also comments on the sorry  manner in which the mentally disabled are treated with in society. Who would have known there would be a romantic comedy that I enjoyed, where the romance is sweet, the comedy mostly slapsticky with background music running throughout the film. To top it of, it also had non-linear narration that it could have done without. All elements that put me off a film. Boy, do I like it when a film turns my generalized dislikes into things that I like about the film. ]"
361,"[Whatever you've heard about Gasper Noe's Irreversible is true. It is disturbing, graphic and brutal, and definitely not a film that everyone can watch. Maybe that is one of the reasons I wanted to watch the film. Not entirely because of a rebellious streak, but because I remember reading a review about the film long ago that said it shouldn't be seen by women. I don't know if I wanted to make a point or just see what the big deal was with Irreversible, but regardless, there is no denying it is a painful watch, for more reasons than one.Irreversible is told in a reverse narrative, about a couple, Alex (Monca Bellucci) and Marcus (Vincent Cassel) who head out on a regular evening to a party. The movie follows Marcus and Alex's ex Pierre (Albert Dupontel), through a route of revenge for a brutal act against Alex. There are sickening bouts of violence and sexual explicitness through the film, the intention of which seems fairly clear on the director's part. The idea is to make the viewer feel extremely uncomfortable, with swirling, shaky camera movements and jarring, low frequency sounds that dominate the first thirty minutes of the film. Purposed achieved, except what remains unclear is how the fundamental plot of the film justifies this treatment. It's as if Noe decided he wanted to bully his audience, with the experimentation portrayed in Irreversible, barring the fact that hand-held and shaky camera movements are hardly experimental these days. This might be a purist thought, but if a filmmaker decides to use certain experimental techniques in his film, shouldn't the basic story of the film have some sort of connect to it? As a viewer you can deduce why Memento used a non-linear technique, to explain the complexities of the situation involving Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce). Lars Von Trier's Antichrist also has a reputation of being graphic, but after a viewing you can understand that it's a part of the personalities of the lead characters. With Irreversible, however, one feels like Noe wanted to make a film involving sexual explicitness, extreme violence and wanted to experiment with camera and sound - so he chose the first basic story that came to his mind. Irreversible is technically meticulous, no doubt. The overall feel is like the camera's been handed to an omniscient bystander, who has no control of it. The film seems like it's been taken in one shot, the cuts are cleverly included at correct points. He's played around with the idea of time, in terms of narrative structure and thought provoking dialogue - but again the question of relevance comes in. Somehow, at the end of the film you don't feel like the reverse narrative is justified - perhaps it's because the climax, even though a revelation, doesn't match to the build up of the narrative. The official DVD has a couple of basic features like the director's commentary and an interview with Belluci about the film. But the star attraction of the DVD is definitely a making of the violent and sexual scenes - how certain tricks were used and the invisible cuts were planned. In its defense, Irreversible does hold a certain vision of emotions gone wild, and that being translated into a visual experience. Maybe the treatment is faulty, and there might be some viewers out there who'd appreciate blurry, seemingly Avant Garde feel of the film, or maybe I've missed the point entirely. Nonetheless, Irreversible is a hard film; surely one to extract an extreme emotion out of you. Whether you're a man or a woman, be warned before you watch it. ]"
362,"[I have a theory - you can only truly enjoy a Woody Allen film if you carry with you a bit of neuroticism. Like they sometimes ask you to leave your brains at home for mindless entertainers, I suggest you carry an extra set of wit, over-analyses, free-flowing thought and a little craze in order to truly enjoy any Woody Allen movie. Don't ask why; just step right into his world.Of course, his last few films have been celebratory odes to classic cities like London (Cassandra's Dream), Paris (Midnight in Paris), Barcelona (Vicky Christina Barcelona) and now Rome with To Rome With Love, but he never really leaves behind his volley of indulgent, neurotic one-liners and exploration of human emotion. It's the Woody Allen stamp that makes this film charismatic and funny, and you ought  to watch the film for that sheer warm feeling in your heart.In To Rome With Love, he continues to write his on-going love letter to Europe, by introducing a concoction of stories that make Rome such a delightful place to be. He also categorizes Rome as a catalyst for the basic deconstruction of the human emotions that we take granted for: love, loyalty and simplicity to quote a few. Every parallel narrative brings our characters out of their worlds to experience something out of the ordinary, in order to remind them not to take the potential of being alive for granted. Following four separate story lines, the film traces different set of characters and their experiences with Rome. Expatriates and students, Sally and Jack (Greta Gerwig and Jesse Eisenberg) are a couple who find trouble when Sally's friend Monica (Ellen Page), a neurotic, vixen like character. The story is pulled through the looming presence of John (Alec Baldwin), who meets Jack while he is visiting his old neighborhood. John's presence becomes like an older, more mature version of Jack's conscience providing witty insights to his adulterous experience.There's also a small-town couple, Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi), who relocate to Rome to start a new life. They get whirl-pooled into a messy, almost slapstick situation as Antonio has a run in with a prostitute (Penelope Cruz). On the other hand Milly gets lost in the city, and finds herself on a movie set with her favorite star Luca Salta (Antonia Albanese). Their innocence gets humorously trampled as each find themselves giving into temptation and nerves. Perhaps two of the most absurd yet hilarious storylines belong to Roberto Benigni (who plays a common Roman man called Leopoldo) and Fabio Armiliato  (playing a bathroom opera singer). Each of the stories are confusing, complex and ever meandering, and as you're running around in circles with the characters you aren't allowed a moment to retain your calm. To Rome With Love throws at you twisted deductions, as well as known emotions and analyses that are entertaining to watch, nonetheless. Cinematographer Darius Khondji gives us a spectacular bird-eye view of the city and it's cinematic interruptions into the narrative. Allen establishes the flavor of Rome well, and much like his earlier films, makes you want to experience the city first hand.There is a point in the film, when all the mishaps (both comical and contemplative) have occurred, where Alec Baldwin says to Jesse Eisenberg, ""A foolish man once said, Stuff happens"". As a viewer you know the potential of that underplayed sentence because in To Rome With Love, stuff does in fact merely happen. But it brings a well-thought, well-entertained smile on your face. ]"
363,"[Raaz 3 is a very regular horror film. It provides it share of unintended laughs, goes through the motions of trying to spook you with sudden peek-a-boo by the devil. And since there is a devil at work you cannot escape the age old science vs. faith argument. Unfortunately, nothing about the way it is done is novel either. Sure, you get to see Bipasha Basu in a viciously negative role and you do wish death upon her. But what you see in the trailer, is just about what she maintains for the length of the film. Somehow the character's arc sounds way too similar to that from Heroine except the black magic part, hopefully. If Bipasha plays the dark witch, Shanaya, Esha Gupta is the purest of pure whites, Sanjana. Which basically translates to her screaming and getting scared a whole lot. This must certainly be covered in Acting 101, and Esha Gupta does that just fine, except for the times her diction goes off.Bang between the two is gray Aditya (Emraan Hashmi) who is caught between what seems like duty and love. Herein lies the greatest folly of Raaz 3's concept. Something as disastrous as black magic is supported by Aditya for some flimsy reasons. You are never once convinced that he is that subservient to Shanaya's wishes. Emraan Hashmi, must be able to carry such roles with effortless ease, especially since he gets to seal a couple of problem situations with what he does best, a  kiss. Besides the regular stock of songs and aerobic dances, Raaz 3 has its expected share of scenes that are meant to scare with a relentlessly thumping background score. Not a single of these 'scary' scenes come as a shock that will make you edge towards the end of the seat. This is despite a reasonable dilemma faced by Aditya. But, it isn't taken too far and the struggle is too superficial. The 3D too is used either just for the sake of it except for just a couple of times for a few 'horror' scenes, not to mention that you can see the blur/ghost at times even while wearing the 3D glasses.Everything about Raaz 3 feels shallow and very uni-dimensional. Even a character as gray as Aditya, isn't treated with any detail. Raaz 3 is yet another run-of-the-mill, Bhatt horror film. ]"
364,"[On surface level, Mugamoodi (Mask), from the acclaimed director Myshkin, sure poses as a bland name for a superhero movie. Anand (a) Lee (Jiiva) the man, who would adorn the coveted mask in the movie, is a loafer to his father's eyes and the world which consists of his girl. But according to him, he is a dreamer who wants to make it big in the world by doing something that would require his complete soul to be involved &amp; not just a 9-5 of his time.From the many characters and the other unlikely ones (especially Anand's grandfather scientist), one could sense a pattern of sorts emerge from the way they behave. It is as though when Myshkin wanted to make a super-hero flick, his dystopian characters (the ones that we associate him with in his earlier ventures) decided to wear a mask and fill in for the requisite roles of a super-hero flick. This could well be the real purpose of naming the movie as Mugamoodi, the mask that Myshkin's world wears to enter the super-hero world; the point  being so extensively explained in the song 'vaayamoodi summa iruda'. As Anand's friends start to sing the song which would advise about his dazed state of mind after love at first sight, Myshkin just lets his hero jump into Swiss alps, ripping away from his roots and make it into a mere romantic number. Unfortunately, though he stands in a picturisque location, his heart still thinks and talks in a way only people in his world do. For a super-hero movie to stay in our mind, it needs that extra special writing, which Myshkin somehow managed in the first half by borrowing elements from his Hollywood counterparts. Albeit being able to accustom to the 'what if Myshkin's brand of characters were set in a super-hero plot', as the movie moved-on from the build-up phase and stepped into serious 'super-hero' action, I couldn't stand the travesty. From being an inspired effort, the film became a spoof of the American heroes; especially at the fag-end of the tale where we are confused whether to laugh or shout with anger over the happenings on the screen. Looking back, the warning which Anand's friends gave him during the 'vaayamoodi summa iruda' song, could actually be for Myshkin, who intentionally deviated from his roots, then on, into a field he couldn't penetrate.]"
365,"[Yes, nearly 20 years after the last episode - Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade in which Indy went in search of the Holy Grail along with his father Henry Jones senior, Indy is back!The trademark battered fedora is present and so is the bull whip but Indy as played by Harrison Ford is older, more battered, and in seemingly reasonable physical condition.  Spielberg must have wondered as to what he should do with the script of this film, coming as it does nearly twenty years after the last Indy film and twenty seven years after Raiders of the Lost Ark, the film that made Indiana Jones into a cult hero in pop culture.  In the interim, innumerable blockbuster action adventures have made their way onto screens the world over. When Raiders of the Lost Ark was released in 1981 it signaled the birth of the monster blockbuster and practically set the trend for swashbuckling action adventures.  Post that, we have had films as varied as Romancing the Stone to King Solomon's Mines to the recent execrable National Treasure, all of which owe their existence to Raiders.  So what does the latest Indy film have to offer?  Unfortunately, it offers the same elements as the first one - elaborate action set pieces - three in all, including the one at the opening of the film, dry banter between the lead characters, and a plot that involves archaeological hocus pocus with an accent on the paranormal.  I used the word unfortunately, because it is all been done before and Spielberg has nothing new to offer to the viewer either in terms of style or content.So we have the mouldy caves and rotting mummies, flesh eating ants, mysterious riddles written in long forgotten languages, and exotic locales - the Amazon in this case, not to forget the search for some absolutely super duper mysterious artifact.  While the enemies in the earlier films (Raiders and Holy Grail) were the Nazis, this film situated in 1957, has the Russians playing the evil ones at the height of the Cold War, and so we have Cate Blanchett as a very Rosa Klebb type of character (remember From Russia with Love) with a super pseudo Russian accent and creased military pants.Spielberg has stuck to the comic book feel of the earlier Indy films, and the set pieces are quite standard.  True to form, two set pieces involve motor vehicle chases, with Indiana Jones leaping in and out of moving vehicles and Shia LeBeouf indulging in some Douglas Fairbanks style swordplay.Spielberg does throw in an occasional surprise, as in the sequence where Indy stumbles onto a nuclear testing site.  The other sequence where a motorcycle chase ends in a library is also pretty good.I missed Sean Connery and his witty comments; what we get here is the banter between Harrison Ford and Shia LeBeouf, which for the most part is quite flat.  The climax is all CGI generated, and quite tame.Yes, I felt nostalgic while watching this film and thinking of the years gone by, but that is all this film is likely to do for the fans of Indiana Jones.  For the viewer who has not seen an Indy film before I would highly recommend a viewing of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, you could safely give this one a miss!]"
366,"[Joker is not your typical Akshay Kumar action-comedy. It starts of being and looking silly, stays so and ends up even sillier. But this is not the regular slapsticky comedy either. It is cute silly. The characters of the obscure village Paglapur have their quirks as you would expect, but they react consistently with their character without getting too repetitive. And the repetition is mostly enjoyable.A lot of the repetition being tolerable has to do with the perfect length of the film. At a good 15 minutes less than two hours, Joker is just right to make the goofing about acceptable. The complete absence of toilet humor and innuendos feels so fresh in a product like this. But that is what Joker's humor is not. The humor that it does have too, is pretty situational and induces hearty laughs.Unfortunately, the humor fizzles out as Joker turns its focus towards the story. While trying to literally bring Paglapur on the map, the story that Agastya (Akshay Kumar) and company cook up goes out of control. Which would have been fine for the genre that writer, Shirish Kunder wants to keep the film in. But the fun fizzles out and the characters start focusing on the logistics of when and how.While, logistics and logic are welcome in any story, in the fantasy world of Paglapur - where the nights are lit with lanterns made out of fireflies - they distract you from the fun. Not that there is any consistency in logic through the film - for example, a village so remote that it has no power supply, but has electricity to light up the village like it's Christmas not to mention has mobile and internet connection. And oh, this dot of a village is not devoid of item numbers - Maharashtrian ones at that, bang in the middle of the Hindi belt.It is such things that were so easy to take care of and would have added an additional layer of humor. And this inconsistency with sudden focus on the dry story that pulls Joker down. Else, I'd have shocked myself by actually liking this one. As is, I am a little surprised to think of the film as 'not bad'. Especially if you think of it as a film for children that adults can go to, too. The storyline involving aliens and such is not only  in the kid zone, the commentary on Indian politics might also be quick education for kids on what's lined up for them in years to come. Except for the item number, of course. The story in fact, does come across as a bunch of kids sitting around playing, ""make a story"" where every child in turn contributes one line to a story that is built right there as the game progresses. Joker is fun in that kind of a way. Also, Joker does have a lot of other social commentary and analogies thrown in for us to notice. Moreover, this is the rare chance for us to watch Akshay Kumar not play himself but  stick to his character. While it is much too serious a comparison, his character reminded me Mohan from Swades. There are no histrionics, no slow-mo entries, no glamour, no super-hero attitude. He plays plain and simple Agastya who's conscious suddenly wakes up to do well for his village. The rest of the cast has Shreyas Talpade playing one of the most hilarious characters. And this too is well-served by use in appropriate measure and not overdoing it. The other men bring in their laughs too - from Vrijesh Hirjee to Asrani. The women on the other hand have precious little to do and the film could have pretty much done without their characters.They together form this fantasy land, Paglapur, which might as well have been Lilliput from Gulliver's Travels. Unfortunately, it doesn't end with the same dose and style of humor as it starts with. And the story is childish while trying to maintain an adult interest in it. A little bit of neither here nor there and yet a welcome change from what we have come to expect from a Akshay Kumar film.]"
367,"[Radio comes across as an attempt at comic-strip romance - absolutely unnecessary chapter-divisions and all. I realize the chapter titles were supposed to be funny but they fall flat after the third time they come up on screen. Points can be granted for trying to make the entire look and feel incline towards eccentric. And that was refreshing. But the story was so random that even though it was meant to add to the madness, it didn't quite work. Especially after the funky start, the resilient radio that lasted through a monsoon and played Binaca Geet Mala 30 years ago. Wasn't it Cibaca Geet Mala and aired on Radio Ceylon at that time? Anyways, after the initial interest, the film was all downhill. The repetitions of the meaningless ""it's complicated"" stamp on the chapter title cards got annoying really quick. Oh yes, and how can I forget the ""mann ka radio"" sounding itself off every 8th minute. One of those nice tunes which get annoying just because they stick in your head and just won't go away. Not the tune's fault I guess, but something is wrong if you are irritated with yourself while humming it. So, however intentional the randomness might have been, it ended up only getting annoying and boring by the end. The not-so-great, not-so-bad performances of the cast certainly didn't add to the experience. That it didn't take away anything from it, doesn't say much either.]"
368,"[You are not going to get good-looking people oozing with style when you set out to watch this one. On the contrary, there are some scenes in which Abhishek Bachchan (Guru) looks border-line ugly. What you will get though is some outstanding performances. True, the anti-climatic end disappoints. But, fortunately, it's the end; you have already enjoyed two hours of an overall fine product.In Hindi cinema, a lot of the credit goes to the director when almost all the actors give great performances. This is, arguably, one of the finest performances Abhishek Bachchan has given. Many people who were struggling in the 70s and 80s will identify with Guru's ambitions, and how he is pulled down by most people around him. The audience grows with the character...and so does his belly. The success of many movies, in this day and age, depends a lot on ""cute dimples"" and ""wow! What muscles!"". It takes tremendous courage for a leading star to gain so much weight and get rid of  the ""sexy stubble"" because the character needs it. Remember that's not make-up, that is actual flab, which he will have to lose soon enough.Mithun Chakraborty makes you wish that he had acted like this in his times. R. Mahadevan looks extremely comfortable in the shoes of a journalist and Vidya Balan moves you to tears even though her character has had just 4-5 scenes to develop. The only actor that sticks out with a mediocre performance was Aishwarya Rai. All she needed to do was to dance and look pretty. Though she looks her usual dainty self, somehow her dance had a very ""1-2-3-change"" feel. The very little acting she needed to do, came across as mechanical. Guru does not have an earth-shattering story, which is what makes the movie look real. But, it does have a few glaring loopholes with gaps in the plot and thus leaves the audience with questions. E.g., the audience is not told the exact manner in which Guru succeeds. Abhishek and Aishwarya switch in and out of the Gujrati accent and the lack of continuity is obvious. Also, cinematic liberty has been taken while handling technical medical issues of certain characters. All of which could have been forgiven had the climax had impact. It is a shame that a director of this caliber could not resist evoking the demon of melodrama in the last twenty minutes. The whole treatment of the climax looks very out-of-place and surreal. Nevertheless, the outstanding cinematography, the very believable dialogues, the foot-tapping music, and of course the outstanding performances make Guru worth a visit to the cinema halls.]"
369,"[With a title like ""Hridaynath"" ('Ruler of the Heart', apparently) and with the kind of poster this film had, the expectations one would have had while walking in to watch the film would have been fairly obvious. The first few minutes of the film would have cemented those expectations. A soliloquy by the film's lead actor, Jackie Shroff, against the backdrop of a sunset along the Konkan coast, talking about the disconnect between matters of the heart and mind; the touching, if tad dramatic, revelation that he is a schoolteacher in a village who is about to retire after 40 years of selfless service to generations of students; things were indeed set up nicely for a sensitive story about a middle aged man on the cusp of a new phase of his life. Alas, not only does the film go downhill faster than a professional skier, it is the 'how' of it that will truly boggle the audiences' mind. The tragedy here is that I can't talk about the asinine plot twist at intermission that threw one particularly petulant audience member behind me into a hyperventilating rant about the evils of choosing to watch a film based on its promos.It isn't just the absurdity of the plot that rankles though. The entire setup and resolution are flawed because of the excess in them. One whole half is spent repeatedly hammering the character traits of the protagonist on the audiences' head, while the other half is spent deconstructing it, in a sense. Also, while considerable and noteworthy effort has clearly gone into making the film look like it has decent production values, the fact remains that the lack of budget shows quite often. If one were to put a gun to my head however, and ask me to point out at least one positive that can be drawn from this film, it would have to be Jackie Shroff. The man is quite clearly having fun, and in spite of his labored Marathi, one can clearly see the hard work that has gone into his dubbing for the film. And which Rangeela fan wouldn't smile at the sight of Jackie Shroff and Urmila Matondkar together on screen, even if the situation is plain ridiculous? If ever there had to be a movie whose plot deserved to be given away, it would undoubtedly be Hridaynath; discussing the film would be infinitely more fun than the film itself. However, since I truly believe in the ideology behind wogma, all I'd like to say is that unless you like Parinda as much as I do and have grown up in awe of Jackie Shroff's swagger in films like Tridev, Hridaynath can very safely be avoided without an iota of doubt. ]"
370,"[I was in tears, out of boredom. It hurts when you find a film disgusting enough that it gets to your nerves. It is not about mindless slapstick or the quality of humor, it is more about of the lack of anything at all - complete absence of any thought put in creating a half-decent product. Especially, when there was more than enough potential given a middle-aged Parsi couple. Also, there are a couple of interesting dilemmas to play with. But none are taken too seriously and are in fact, left unaddressed. All you can do then, is shake your head in despair. Usually a 'How can anyone..."" question is pretty vain. The most obvious answer is - ""well, like they just did..."" But Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi makes it difficult to control from asking a series of such questions. How could Sanjay Leela Bhansali write such an incoherent story? How could every one involved in the film not see how tedious it was getting? How could they make a film less than two hours feel so long? How could anyone think Farah Khan could act?!The lady talks like she does as a judge in one of the reality shows. Same tone, same expression, plain flat. Any attempt at changing the expressions seem forced and affected. Shirin Farhad... almost felt like it was to make true Farah Khan's childhood wish of playing the lead in a school play, she wasn't allowed to be a part of. Her way of telling the world, ""because I can do it!"" Fortunately, her off-timing can use the lame, predictable lines as an excuse. But, then almost all departments contribute in equal measure to the sinking ship. The songs win the race in taking it down faster. The point that the story tries to get at lacks power too - that some of us make an issue out of little things instead of focusing on the big picture. The narrative is so lackluster that the audience couldn't be bothered wit h it. Sure, Boman Irani tries his best to save the film with a lot of grace. But, all you want to do is give him a bear hug for having had to do this film. He must have his reasons, for how many directors/writers are going to go with him as the lead anchor of the film, despite all his capabilities? And for that the Bhansali brother-sister duo need to be applauded. It takes guts to have non-standard characters as leads, especially in a debut film. But, some points need to be taken off for having Boman Irani participate in this one. Also, the rest of the story is soporific and induces more yawns and snores than laughs. Except for the one or two 'funny lines' in the trailers, there's barely anything that can even induce a smile. And just when you think, ""yay! Just five minutes to go!"", you get a ""Did you think we can't make this worse?"" climax. A supposedly 'cute' romantic comedy with zero chemistry between the lead actors and many moments that want to make you bang your head on the closest wall rather than laugh - that is what Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi is all about. ]"
371,"[I love it when a film shows most of what is covered in the promos in the first few minutes of the film. That means they haven't given away too much and I have a lot of new stuff to look forward to. But, of course, I shouldn't have begun to hope because the twists of Ek Tha Tiger are clear from a mile away. The rest of the story is just another love story, this once, masked under the guise of feuding nations, instead of feuding families. The 'message' being of international peace. Thankfully, the message isn't drilled down in preachy dialogue. Yet, the dialogue isn't what one is used to in a Salman film - oozing of style and filminess. Not that that makes the dialogue subtle or likeable. It is just plain lines trying their best to make an impact. Unsuccessfully.This failure has nothing to do with Salman Khan's usual lack of emotion in dialogue. Nor does it have anything to do with Katrina's reversion to lifeless dialogue delivery (which is sad to watch.) The writing just doesn't carry that kind of weight or charm. Every time, you think there might be a decent 'moment' coming up, you are let down by something very ordinary. The heart vs. brain dilemma or even the interesting crossroads that India and Pakistan's intelligence agencies find themselves in is a very thin thread to hook your interest on. But hey, what do you need any of that for when you have two of the best-looking people in the industry filling every frame of the screen. Interestingly, Ek Tha Tiger, unlike most Salman films or even action films, gives the lead lady a lot to play with and a lot more screen time. A welcome change, however wasted it might have been rendered by Katrina Kaif's emotionless, heavily made up, facial muscles - almost as if she was directed to match Salman's attempt at acting.The songs too have very little Salman about them. They look and sound like any other regular masala flick. Except for 'mashaallah' which you have to wait for until the end credits. The question then remains - should they have attempted to have a coherent story when they didn't intend to make anything substantial, impactful or entertaining about it? Or should they have simply stuck to what Salman Khan fans enjoy best - mindless action. The action too is more or less lackluster, except for the chase sequence in the climax. Seeing a woman in a Hindi film do cat-like moves is entertaining, alright. But, of course, they had to go ahead and spoil it by some awful use of what looks like green screen and shoddy post-production work. Ek Tha Tiger is an underwhelming experience for a neutral party like me. But going by the fact that I heard almost all dialogue and none of it died down with whistles and cheers tells me that would be a fan's take too.Oh yes, ladies, you do get a glimpse of a shirtless Salman Khan. Fine, gents too.]"
372,"[In every mass hero film's opening shot, as the hero poses in his immaculate signature style, the camera zooms in to capture the gushing zeal of a no-nonsense hero accompanied by an earth shattering buildup of tempo; all for the thundering response it would get in the theatres, all over. Eons have passed and yet we aren't sure whether the response is for the signature pose or the mere appearance of the mass hero or the wonderful build-up to the fitting coda. But, when Allu Arjun (the mass-hero of Julayi) comes into the frame as suddenly as a dog crossing the street, we are left with none of the three factors to cheer for the mass-hero. However, the past master that he is, director, Trivikram compensates for that by conjuring an enticing bank robbery as the next scene to show the acumen of our beloved hero.Julayi, its mass commercial formula notwithstanding, is the story about the clash of intellects. While the protagonist is an impatient youth, who can't wait to climb up the ladder of riches, the antagonist is a self-conceited criminal. While the former tends to bend any rules to achieve his dream, the latter exudes passion for his art of robbery. What binds them together though, is their willpower and unorthodox and yet street smart brain. With such an alluring concept, Trivikram starts off as a crazy entertainer with some wonderful witty lines thrown in - dialogues have always been Trivikram's strong hold. Unfortunately, as the game progresses, the dialogues become its own shackle in the incoherent script. Where there should be riveting action &amp; pertinent lines, there is exorbitant action &amp; brimming lines. Not just that; from the songs &amp; their dance sequences to the overzealous comic relief portions to the exaggerated de-glamorization of Ileana D'Cruz (the love interest alias dream girl), every other ingredient thinks itself as the talking point of the film and eventually irritate us.The problem with Julayi, is not the lack of idea, it is the overabundance of it without proper packaging - a pre-requisite for these kinds of movies. It is easy to say Julayi isn't a good movie, but with enthralling set-pieces springing up now &amp; then it becomes really hard to lose hope on the movie; albeit these highpoints aren't promising enough to say the movie is fairly engaging. In the end, Julayi true to its name turns out to be an aimless wanderer, meandering over a lot of wonderful things for the sake of being a masala caper, but ends up being a poorly mixed cocktail.]"
373,"[I suspect the director had a deprived past. He was shown movies that lacked the slo-mo stylization of the ""star"". Also he felt disadvantaged when the writers didn't spell out how a particular thing ""happened"" in a film. So much so that when he saw it for the first time, he decided, ""I swear by everyone dear to me, I'll make sure the viewers don't feel left-out. I'll explain in detail in flashbacks what just happened two minutes ago. It'll also have so much unnecessary style that no child will have to suffer like me."" Only that hopefully, the child in you has grown enough to keep your kids away from Ek. But, if you enjoy the absurdity that our films come up with more often than not, then this is your dose of nirvana. I kid you not; Bobby Deol doesn't have a single regular speed shot or a normally delivered dialogue till minute 40. Complete with loud, pompous background music, weird camera movements and all. The style goes for about a minute and come right back. Maybe that's what the title refers to. O-kay, I'm exaggerating one tiny bit. And just in case you are wondering, they weren't partial to Bobby Deol, they had a bit of that going for each of the other main characters. As promised though Nana Patekar does come in a different, ""cool"" avatar. His casual manner of saying lines adds that required touch of humor. It does require some finesse to deliver such crass lines with charm. While I'm at giving credit where it's due, there are a couple of smart lines when Nandu (Bobby Deol) talks to Joshi (Raghuveer Yadav). All of this is nullified and taken further down with one tiring monologue after monologue, especially towards the end. None of the other characters are fleshed out. They all are just a part of your regular Punjabi family. No creativity at all. The loud women, one quiet lady, the giggling girls, the over-smart kids, the annoying lead actress, the cunning good-for-nothings. And yes the completely avoidable Chunkey Pandey! Yet, the writing is not a 100% loss. The transition in Bobby Deol's character is pretty smooth. And yet, it's a far cry from believable. It comes across as the start of a good thought that didn't go all the way to completion. Just like it is neither a full-fledged comedy, nor a romantic film, nor an action, nor a thriller. A bit of each of these and incomplete in all of them. It serves as a strong reminder of the films in which masala was of utmost importance. This has that too, but again, not in full strength and thus doesn't leave a good aftertaste.]"
374,"[There haven't been very many films in the recent past that traverse the graph that Girish Mohite's Bharatiya does, with respect to the nature of its narrative. Armed with an interesting concept, the film is rocky but intriguing for much of its first hour. Thereafter, it descends into absurdity and preachiness of the kind that is bound to irritate even the most tolerant viewer at some point or the other.The film opens with a wandering soothsayer, played by Makarand Anaspure, breaking the fourth wall and talking to the audience. He introduces the story that is about to unfold, in a forgotten village called Adnide, located on the Maharashtra-Karnataka border. The village itself has a host of expectedly quirky characters. Mohan Agashe and Kuldeep Pawar, for example, play a couple of power hungry old men who are at each other's throats, all the while vying to be the head of the village. The soothsayer goes on to suggest that something explosive is soon going to happen in this village. Enter city-bred lad Abhay Sardeshmukh (played by Subodh Bhave) who intends to return to the village where his ancestors hailed from, for reasons that unveil as the film progresses.The film's one-word theme is quite simple - identity. What does it mean, to belong to a village, a state and a country, especially one like India, perhaps the most diverse nation in the world? Using a sleepy village that seems to run on autopilot as the subject actually doesn't seem like too bad an approach to explore this question. However, the story meanders around such farfetched situations and characters that it becomes hard to take the film seriously after a particular point.That isn't to say that the film doesn't entertain. It does, even if only sporadically, mainly because of some of the dialogue and the performances. Pawar and Agashe are in fine form, injecting their deadpan comedy with near-perfect timing. Jitendra Joshi is another actor who shines. Last seen playing the title role in Tukaram, this one is a little more up his alley - a confused lover forever eyeing the daughter of his rival. Few people play dumb on screen like he does, and he does make you laugh with this character as well.One must grant that Subodh Bhave does try his best as the opinionated, petulant do-gooder that his character Abhay is. However, one can only do so much with a character that is as flat, preachy and, quite frankly, ridiculously silly as this one is. Intended to be the anchoring pillar of the film, Abhay's character is quite easily one of the major flaws of the film. Switching genres ever so often eventually becomes a problem for the film, because the audience rarely knows what to expect. While that may be a good thing for a film that is solely a thriller, this one is not. Not knowing that you are actually watching a political satire means a lot of the situations will actually be lost on you.While director Girish Mohite has definitely moved forward since his last film, the disastrous Pratibimb, Bharatiya is still not a film that I'd recommend. In spite of the generous dose of comic moments, Bharatiya eventually becomes a tedious watch.]"
375,"[Harud (Autumn), directed by the talented Aamir Bashir, isn't the easiest of films to watch. Set in an autumn in Kashmir around the time cellular services are set to be launched in the strife-torn state, it tells the story of a family that has lost one son and is grappling with a tormented other. Poignant and confusing in equal measures, it is a film that can be discussed far more than the run time of the film; a film that is sure to have polarized opinions, ranging from it being called sensitive and beautiful, to it being found slow and downright pretentious. Harud is that rare film, however, which I'd recommend, even if I'm not sure whether the person I'm recommending it to will like it or not. Rafiq, the surviving son of the family, is the focal point of the film. Essentially directionless, his life seems to slowly take meaning when he picks up something that belonged to his brother. Without giving anything away, the best thing for me about Harud is the journey that Rafiq takes between finding his brother's belonging and actually using it for the first time. Co-written, co-produced and shot by Shanker Raman, arguably one of India's best cinematographers today, the film's real victory lies in the manner in which it captures life in Kashmir. No wide, sweeping shots to capture the beauty of the Valley here; Harud is more intimate than that. It is the close-ups, the long, hand-held takes of faces, actions and life that truly bring out the essence of what it must be like to live in such a beautiful place, yet have terror hanging over your head like the Sword of Damocles.The film, however, suffers from some key flaws, which bring the film down considerably. Primary amongst them are the performances. Even though every character looks their part completely, the acting is quite wooden and stilted at places. The dialogues often sound like they are being read out, rather than being felt by the characters and delivered.Also, there seems to be no real clarity on exactly what the makers of the film were trying to convey. Yes, the angst of families living in Kashmir, the fact that youth there are looking to escape that life, the little nuances in the life of a Kashmiri, all of these, and more, are there in the film in abundance. And the fact that clearly, the intention is to draw our attention to it is visible in the treatment. But, visual appeal apart, there seems to be no particular reason for a lot of the happenings in the film. For example, I enjoyed every one of the long, beautiful tracking shots of Rafiq on a bicycle, but I can't claim to understand exactly why there were so many of them in the film.While uninspiring writing and poor acting can potentially cripple a film, with Harud, they come across more as aberrations than anything else. The long takes are compensated for by the edgy camera-work, bringing about a sense of urgency despite the slow pace. The cinematography is one of the reasons I never found the film slow at all. Minimalist in every sense, the film has virtually no background music, relying on the sounds of Kashmir to create emotions that would otherwise have been created by music.Harud is the kind of film that you need to submit yourself to, to immerse yourself in, in order to enjoy the visual and emotional experience that it is. Personally, I've seen a number of films set in Kashmir before, but this is truly the first film that has made me want to actually live there. ]"
376,"[Disclaimer: This review assumes you have watched part I. It might contain comments that refer to event of the previous film.*A movie that uses a strong, scheming woman, who has very little to do in the rest of the film, as bookends  - almost as if she was given the honor of holding the story together. A movie that uses humor provided by a local brass band singer as a leitmotif to mark all significant events - morose or celebratory. Gangs of Wasseypur II is a movie that engages you in its quirkiness because that quirkiness still has bearings with what is real. A fusion of sorts between grit of a village in Jharkhand and pulp-film style whackiness. Gangs of Wasseypur II is as much about these seemingly insignificant characters as it is about its revenge-driven protagonists and the looming theme of the futility of violence. The smaller characters add flavor and ambiance to the brutal environment they are trying to thrive in. The main players of Wasseypur, Faisal (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) and Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia) keep you wondering about their next move. We know their motivations, yet we are unsure if and when they will strike. It is macho to the core. The women too have an undying fire in the belly. Though they don't take matters in their own hands, but they surely don't stress over sending their sons to war. The ruthlessness in the violence is just something else. Some scenes are so gruesome as if compensating for the few that didn't feature violence. Yet, none of it seems misplaced or overdone. A character who has gone through what he has gone through, with those motivations is bound to react with that ferocity. Only that, almost all characters share the same love for hardcore violence, so a viewer who has reservations against blood and gore might do well outside the theater. For others, though it is a release for the latent anger, vicarious as it may be.So much so that, every time someone from Ramadhir Singh's gang is killed, you can sense the success in the audience. The bigger the player taken down, the stronger the sense of victory. Which is amusing too. Because the good guys aren't really good either, right? They are murderers, black marketeers, and brutal ones too. A doped-out good-for-nothing son of a goon, turns into a goon. So?What is it then that the audience is rooting for? This question bothered me quite a bit because I knew not why I am rooting for these barbarous slayers. And the slight difference emerged - their motivations. The loyalty of the Khans to their main purpose versus the political and convoluted reasons of Singh's men. In fact, Faisal is even caught introspecting on why and how he got dragged into it all. He reflects on his personal dreams. And this is where all the Bollywood references fit in. As amusing as they might seem, they point at the unachieved dreams of the masses. Moments and situations like these and the grounded feeling the whole film carries is what make me ignore the two main grouses I have against Gangs of Wasseypur II. The choice of narration - it reads like a book, chapter-wise, without smooth flow. If it weren't for Piyush Mishra's voice and tone, the voice-over would seem never-ending. It felt like the story was in constant exposition, especially when the voice-over continues the second half. That new characters and themes are still being introduced post-interval didn't help either. The other complaint goes with my complaint against part 1 - it is not a stand alone film. I would have much rather seen the two parts as one and enjoyed it as one story. By watching it in two parts, both films feel incomplete. But, I guess commercial needs take precedence over my preferences. :) Otherwise the film leaves no room for complaint. Once again to name one actor as having done exemplary work would be unfair. The women in Anurag Kashyap films always stand-out. Not only for the character accorded to them and their strength but also for the unique sensuality he has them bring out. Similarly, to say an Anurag Kashyap film had awesome lighting, camerawork, sound, background score would be making a redundant statement. Also, something about the way Anurag Kashyap uses his music keeps you involved. Many a time, it makes very little sense (at least on first watch) but I still enjoy it. And for that I love it - making me enjoy something I don't understand. Does it glorify violence? Maybe. It uses it brilliantly for sure, especially to bring the narrative to crescendo in the climax. Maybe, it exhibits the vanity of violence by using it paradoxically. If a gang-war film needs to be made, this is the way to do it. Else of course, we watch Godfather, Pulp fiction, read the Mahabharata. But hey, why not try all three-in-one. Oh actually, make that three-in-two. But like anything that is a combination, it won't compare favorably to any one of those by itself. But is a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. ]"
377,"[One of the most annoying things about films that aren't working for you is the genre switch they tend to make through out the film. Did the writer/director want to make a romantic film? Or was it a thriller they were shooting for? Or was it a psycho's story they were trying to narrate? Or did they wish to comment about the system that we are a part of, which is rotting from the very insides? Or was their intention to have steamy scenes featuring a real-life porn star, trying to see how far they could push the envelope?Jism 2's jerkily shifts from one to another without any attempt at keeping a smooth flow. And this is no directorial/editorial experiment we are talking about. The movie goes about narrating whatever little content it has, with all the time in the world and there is no fast-paced, quirky cuts. It is slow and it is mostly boring. The romance is laden with some mumbo-jumbo philosophy. The thriller doesn't manage to engage you too much despite the potential that a Robin Hood-ish protagonist has. His psychopathic inclinations seem out-of-place because we are not entertained to his life experiences, motivations or perception. A monologue at the end of the film is hardly something to suddenly get us interested. And as far at the steamy scenes go, you've seen pretty much all, if you've seen the trailers. Unless you call heavy-duty heaving a part of body language which contributes to acting, Sunny Leone can't act. She barely has any screen presence in terms of captivating our attention by her presence on screen. Arunoday Singh and Randeep Hooda try their best to emote, but this is just the wrong film. And whatever they do ultimately feels like they are overdoing it. Everything in frame looks just so fake and forced. The emotions, the relationships, the connections, the attractions, the power, the anger, the helplessness. Then you are left with hollow dialogue to fill you in with what might be happening. And that is exactly what the words sound like even they seem like they are trying to make some profound sense. At other times it is just inane. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting much from the film either, so it was just a question of sitting through it and waiting for the slow proceeds to be done with.]"
378,"[I still remember when the first Ice Age released me and my best friend were staunch Shrek followers: the kind who would dismiss any other animation film. But when we saw Ice Age we were immediate converts. Ice Age was simple, funny and the characters were adorably relatable. But with each film, the franchise became more about minting money than rediscovering the characters and creating offshoots of the narrative. Ice Age: Continental Drift is the epitome of exactly that phenomenon - it's formulaic, the jokes are puerile and predictable and your kids might like it, but kids like Bol Bachchan these days as well. (Oh, you'd be surprised with their reactions)In the first few minutes we're introduced to the regulars; Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), sabre-toothed Diego (Denis Leary), Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano). Here Manny can't bear the fact that his daughter, Peaches (Keke Palmer), is all grown up. As the movie progresses, he gets separated from his family, along with Diego and Sid, and the adventure entails his quest back home. They encounter a panther pirate (Jennifer Lopez), a walrus (Nick Frost) and a batch of sea-animals led by an Orangutan (Peter Dinklage) on their way. While they are meant to be worthy distractions for the trio, it's one too many characters. The restlessness could be seen, even among kids, and with time the gags stopped being funny. Even the squirrel Scrat isn't any respite, as his antics are mostly done in the earlier films. What makes the movie worse is an unnecessary overdose of the wisdom of parenting, love and all that. While the animation is charming and you find some solace in watching a film where the protagonists have been the same, the plot becomes heavy with so many gimmicks. The jokes and the comedy are funny in the beginning, and that's mostly because you've watched the three previous films. For a first time viewer, Ice Age: Continental Drift is nothing but a animated mash of colors and loud, overdone jokes. Here's my theory: a fourth franchise of Ice Age was never going to be a fun movie. There's only so much you can recycle, plot and gag-wise. At some point, the film will get tedious, and cyclical. It's a pity because when such films are released you wonder what other films could have been made (maybe more than one film) in that much money. It's a vicious cycle. ]"
379,"[When you have a successful franchise in your hand that had survived three decades of viewership, any maker would want to expand the frontiers. While his counterpart in the Don series moved forward with the story, the Ultimate Star of Tamil films decided to tread a different path, that of going back in time to tell the genesis story of David Billa (the Tamil version of Don).  While an original story usually stresses on the formative days of the titular character, with Billa, the urge to see the history of the much revered Don surmounts thanks to the insufficient material available on the reclusive gangster. But five minutes into the movie, with the best dialogue of the trailer wasted terribly, I suspected dreadful times await me. As it happened, after 2 long hours, Billa-2 stood as a testament that any film, no matter how good a star it has, how tech-savvy &amp; creative technicians are involved, will only be as good as the creative vision of the director at the helm of affairs. The problem I had with Billa-2 is not that it couldn't justify the hunger for violence of the protagonist; we have after all welcomed many a maniac who just want the world to burn. I didn't even mind the fact that the film was monotonously only about the escalation of a rampant man. Hell, I could even tolerate a plump hero whip and win over his masculine enemies in a jiffy.  But the issue really was about the convincing factor deployed in it. You really can't make an action movie with the action sequences being its weakest link. From the opening sequence fight, till the much talked about helicopter fight scene, nowhere did the violent rage that seeps out of David Billa's face fill the screen space. As a result we are only able to see computer generated blood bursting out of the cadaver even before the knife touches it.On the hindsight, with wonderful punch lines and some well-intended scenes that ebb out of the crevice, like a much needed crest after a long trough, Billa-2 did have its moments now and then, making me wonder why the writers couldn't be more diligent in the work. Had the creators understood that taking the audience to the coda is as important as the coda itself.Billa-2 sure would have been an adrenaline pumping movie. Unfortunately in its present form, Billa-2 is nothing more than the 2 hours stretched version of its 2 minutes trailer with 1 hour 48 minutes of boredom. If at all the film answers something, it tells an origin story where a plump Ajith Kumar walks all the way to become the trim &amp; fit Billa in the 2007 film.]"
380,"[Disgusting, regressive, juvenile, crass, crappy. All this is what I expected. But Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum isn't even any of that. The indifference with which I could watch the entire film was pretty saddening. I didn't even feel like disliking the film, like it didn't even deserve that kind of response. Sure, there was lots of loud cackle in the theater. Yet, it wasn't as much as I thought there would be. There were a lot of slack times when there was no puerile pun, no supposedly adult joke, no mockery of gay people. They were just drab spans of few minutes each when you could sense the boredom in the theater, assisted ever-so-slightly with a loud remark, ""stop boring us."" However, when there was laughter, it was so hard that I, for a second, wished that I could enjoy the 'non-veg' jokes the way some of the people in the audience were. It is a release to have such a hearty laugh. But all I could think was, really, THAT was funny?But, this was soon overcome by feeling bad for the lead male actors. Riteish Deshmukh and Tusshar Kapoor try hard, you can see the amount of energy such a performance needs, yet all you can feel is sad for them. They've had to regress mentally by a good 20 years. You can imagine how sorry I felt when I saw  Anupam Kher address dogs as humans and sulk when he sees them mate. Yes, there is a lot of dog-mating talk in the film.The women, have to sit pretty and look gorgeous and they do that all well. And well, of course, dance. The songs are peppy and energetic but the lyrics felt like they were trying too hard to make sense. What I found the most hilarious was they actually tried to have a plot to string all of this together. Along with being mockery telemarketing, Rohit Shetty brand of films, and almost everything else that can be considered intelligent, Kyaa Super Kool Hain Hum ends up being a mockery of story writing itself. Like always, I find myself trying too hard to make sense of films that weren't intended to be taken that seriously. But then again, I am a part of that audience. ]"
381,"[In the very beginning of the movie, an aspiring filmmaker gets money from a big-shot under one condition that he makes the financer's aide (an old hefty guy) the hero of the film. Rejecting the offer, the protagonist comes to a coffee shop from where the story kicks off. At the end of the 2-hour long movie, the movie felt like it had great potential to be the decade's best unintentional comedy, had the filmmaker went on to make the film with that aide. The director of Maalai Pozhudhin Mayakathilaey would have spared us from the insipid tale of romance. Sometimes we make few decisions based on certain information. Many a times, they backfire; one such being my decision to watch Maalai Pozhudhin Mayakathilaey. I could go on blotting this page with negativity about the movie but I didn't choose this film to do precisely that. There were concrete reasons that drew me to the silver screen. The symphony of the scintillating tracks by Achu &amp; textbook beauty shoots of Gopi that looked glamorous in the teasers did appease the peeved mind. Though they occupy a fourth of the time space, song sequences alone can never make a poorly made film tolerable. Maalai Pozhudhin Mayakathilaey is another example that unique concept alone can never carry a film to the podium; in this case not even to the cafeteria of the stadium.]"
382,"[Despite the impressions that social and online media seem to be giving, there were other films that released this week as well, ones that did not have a caped crusader as their main protagonist. One of them, Mumbai Pune Mumbai director Satish Rajwade's latest film, Badam Rani Gulam Chor, is an interestingly written and narrated film that is engaging for the most part, even if it often transgresses into being a tad silly. Upendra Limaye, Anand Ingale and Pushkar Shrotri play three friends who live together in a house named 'Unbreakables', something that supposedly signifies the nature of their friendship. What their characters have been named doesn't matter, because they refer to each other as 'Chaku' (knife), 'Maakad' (monkey) and 'Pustak' (book), respectively. Enter Mukta Barve, nicknamed 'Pencil' - a woman who is destined to change their lives for good. Simultaneously, Anand Ingle's character works at a news channel, which is currently covering a major political story, a bust up between two politicians who belonged to the same party.There is inherently nothing new about either of these stories by themselves. But start watching them together, start seeing near-metaphysical connections between them, start drawing parallels between the two and suddenly they seem to be far more similar to each other than it appears on the surface.These two story lines, the parallels drawn between them and the sheer thought behind intertwining them to tell a story is what sets this film apart. In fact, at the concept level it is a stroke of sheer genius. A tantalizingly intelligent use of a medium whose power is currently in shackles because it is easier to do what has been done and make money than pushing the envelope at the risk of losing it.Using comedy backed by strong performances, the film tries hard to do justice to this thought, and achieves it in some measure, but not completely. The reason? Instead of going full throttle on the concept of connecting two seemingly disjoint stories by using the power of narrative and editing, the effort seems to be more on providing a screwball comedy instead. Not a bad idea at all, but one that ends up affecting the basic premise.Still, Badam Rani Gulam Chor manages to have the audience in splits for the most part, not least because of some razor sharp dialogue and some extremely talented actors mouthing them. Limaye, Ingle and Shrotri are in top form, looking and feeling like their characters all the way. True, they almost seem to walk around with signboards bearing their character sketches on it, but that in part adds to the charm of it, the fact that at least the director didn't hold back on how far over the top he was taking the things.Yet, it feels like a promising film that went unfulfilled. The concept and narrative technique needed a more evolved vision and guiding hand to take it to fruition; the will to hold back when required and to go all out when the need arose; the realization that such an opportunity, material like this, might not arise tomorrow, so why not make the most of it now.Badam Rani Gulam Chor is the kind of film that, had it been treated right, would have made for an intimate, stimulating watch, a home video cult. As it stands, it is a series of smart-and-silly laughs that would make for passable weekend viewing on the tube or a family outing at the theatres.]"
383,"[Christopher Nolan really knows how to play with our minds. He sparked a whole new world of ideas in our heads with The Dark Knight in 2008, and of course, had a field day with Inception, but if you pay enough attention, you'll realize that he isn't trying to impress us with The Dark Knight Rises. Nor is he merely telling a story (or closing one, in this case). As a sensible filmmaker and storyteller, he's left the best (read: eccentric, layered and mind-boggling) parts behind, with the peak of the trilogy, which was The Dark Knight.The Dark Knight Rises is what a finale should be; all-encompassing yet mysterious enough to hold one's intrigue, mature, and not experimental in it's treatment of characters and individual scenes and it builds up to a spectacularly fulfilling, almost calming climax and end. The film begins with a near-dystopian Gotham, a shattered Bruce Wayne and no sign of Batman, 8 years since the tragic night he took the blame for Harvey Dent's wayward crimes. By now, Gotham has taken an economical and global hit (very well merged with real-life crises) and Bruce Wayne shows no sign of returning as the city's ""masked vigilante"".The slowly panned out first half establishes all it's characters and the scenario with meticulous detail. This could have been an impatient viewer's grudge with the film, but Nolan gives you enough to bite on before an impending explosion of a second half. We are introduced to Bane (Tom Hardy), a muscular masked terrorist leader who intends on destroying Gotham City. While Hardy's personality as Bane doesn't match up to the sinister villains of the previous films (and it's safe to say here that Ledger's Joker is very hard to match up to), his sheer gritty look is enough to instill fear. Here his mask does the trick; often you can't understand what he's saying but you're half expecting him to, at any moment, lose his temper and tear everything to pieces. His brute demeanor convinces you that he can break Batman apart, and that coupled with a looming fear is what classic villains are made of. Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) a jewel thief who robs for survival, and has several heated interactions with Batman. Tradionally, she's known as Bane's aid, but in the film she follows her own trajectory. Hathaway is strong, witty and plays her part of the Catwoman (although she is never called that) with much panache. Marion Cotillard plays the millionaire Miranda Tate who is a part of the Wayne Enterprises board, and a means of support for Batman as she encourages him to stand up to his responsibility. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, the young police officer is a symbol of our voices as an audience. Through the film we keep expecting Batman to rise, and we never lose faith in him, and Gordon-Levitt's character recreates the faith that the film continuously needs to fall back on. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman resume their characters as Alfred, Fox and Gordon respectively. All of this is familiar territory; a predictable build up to Bane's terrorist plans and as an audience that has seen the first two films, we know what's in store for us. However, as Batman rises and the film starts rolling into action, every moment that you witness is filled with the baggage of 7 years and 2 films, and Nolan presents every moment victoriously. He gives you what you want to see, triumphs what needs to be triumphed, and slashes what needs to burn. And therefore, unlike The Dark Knight (and my intention here is not to compare the films but our reception of them), this film doesn't knock the ground off your feat, but manages to restore it back in place for your sense of stability. The Dark Knight Rises is mature story telling; it closes ends but also leaves a tiny mischievous slit open. It has a barrage of inspiring dialogue and superhero morals soaked in action-heavy sequences that are visually epic (kudos to cinematographer Wally Pfister and Hans Zimmer for the audio-visual treat). Essentially, the film gives you everything that you would need in a finale. You might have wanted more unexpected craziness and more edge of the seat moments (the expectations this film was riding on was almost unreal). However, The Dark Knight Rises is more about what you need as a viewer (and a follower of the trilogy), which is a fluctuating closure: one that's classic and mature, and yet satisfies your need to be surprised. And for recognizing and executing that, take a bow Nolan. ]"
384,"[I love well-made romantic comedies, I am sucked in by many a romantic tragedies. But a comedy that becomes a tragedy and a fresh comedy that turns into a cliched tragedy, it's just disappointing. True, I didn't think Cocktail would be great. In that sense it delivers as promised. But, the problem is it gives hope in the beginning and then just falters and falls in a great thump towards the end. The good thing though is that Cocktail never lets go of the emotions it has stirred - within the characters and  thus what we feel for the audience too. If only, they had let go of the generic love triangle towards the end.You are introduced to abla naari (damsel in distress) Meera (Diana Penty), self-acclaimed cheesy, flirtoholic Gautam (Saif Ali Khan) and one who could pass off as alcoholic, Veronica (Deepika Padukone). Veronica, as if to further define her character is brought in with a bang, especially compared to  the background music free introductory tracks of Meera and Gautam. The pace at which this happens is not in the regular cut-chop-done mode either. It eases you in and you like your stay with them as the chemistry brews with fun and freshness and makes them into much-needed therapists for each other. Unfortunately, as the film progresses you see that very little depth is accorded to Gautam as he soon starts coming across as a shuttlecock in a long rally. In contrast, the female protagonists seem to be holding their own with their dilemmas and yet they plummet to the regular and predictable outcome which most lady leads are destined to - wanting nothing else but to be with their man. Yep, maybe love indeed makes girls behave like girls - forlorn, beyond logic and turns the finest of them into stereotypical whiners. Yet, I enjoyed the supposed nastiness attached to Veronica much like her namesake from the Archie comics (except the protagonist here seems to be more Reggie than Archie). She carries a palpable loneliness within her and drowns it in the chaos of loud pubs. Deepika Padukone does great in carrying the various emotions without it being necessarily spoon-fed.  Even in a scene where she looks out-of-sorts while trying to seduce her man, you see what she's getting at right after. Similarly, Diana Penty, the demure desi in town puts forth her dilemma, her suppressed angst against how her life has shaped up with great warmth. But when these smart, independent women fall head-over-heels in love with an obnoxious over-the-top charmer you only wonder why two beautiful characters are being drowned in inanity. Saif Ali Khan looks at least five years older than he is made out to be. That besides he goes overboard with Gautam's cockiness. As intentional as it might have been, it doesn't make me root for Gautam and his dilemma comes across as silly and immature. It's not that women like 'these' can't fall in love with men like 'that' - it's love, anything can happen - but why I am being asked to give the writers or their characters benefit of doubt? Why can't I see it? I like both women enough that I want both of them to get what they want, but I don't see why they want what they want. Then come the many other quibbles. Not resorting to needless backstory is one thing, and a vivacious Veronica having no friends before Meera and Gautam is quite another. These are the things that distract from the believability of the story. On the other hand, the backstory offered by way of Gautam's mom (Dimple Kapadia) and uncle (Boman Irani) make you wish it wasn't offered. Their characters are mere pawns in making the story make that twist that turns it into ever-so-blah. Not to mention the two awesome actors are made to play loud, meatless characters. Similarly, Meera's husband's (Randeep Hooda) track is also avoidable thus saving a lot of precious screentime. It is all left to the threesome then to pull it through. They do manage for a bit but what can actors do once the script has fallen prey to standard terms and conditions. No experimentation, no risks, no gut. ]"
385,"[Remember the time when a Tim Burton movie surpassed your expectations on its levels of eccentricity (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands)? Well you can mourn those days, because it doesn't look like they're coming back. Earlier this year he made Dark Shadows, which was quite the dud compared to his earlier films, and therefore I wasn't expecting too much from his co-production with Timur Beckmambetov (of Wanted fame) Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. The title itself is rather appalling, to imagine the United States' 16th president as a closet Vampire Hunter. As if we haven't already had an overload of vampires. It's not a biopic of Abraham Lincoln so you can scratch that off. In this version surrounding the president (adapted from a bestselling novel written by Seth Grahame-Smith), a young Lincoln witnesses the death of his mother as a result of befriending an African-American boy (a prevalent practice back in the day). The film moves onto Lincoln's dual life - as he falls in love with Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and eventually enters politics, but the film focuses on his nocturnal activities and adventures, consisting a slasher, VFX heavy second half that includes fictitious recreations of American History as well. While the visuals are quite gripping with its dark greys and even darker crimsons, the two halves of the film seem like separate movies. Not knowing which aspect of Lincoln's life to focus.  The narrative is disconnected and seems to focus more on the visual appeal than the story at hand. Benjamin Walker as Lincoln is pretty convincing, and for interrupted brief moments you do believe that a world where Lincoln was a vampire hunter could exist. What helps are the elaborate set designs, costumes and background score, which allow the suspension of disbelief to last a while. You are pulled out of it however, with the confused narrative. The cuts between an enraged axe-wielding Lincoln and a historically relevant Lincoln are haphazard. You're kept on your toes about the tone of the film.t partly presents itself as a dark, bloody fantasy film and partly as a biopic offering silly, almost comical alternatives to American History.What you must give Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter credit for, is that it is brilliantly shot. Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel uses the frames to further the dark-palette visuals that merge well with the story. While on one hand you have a confused narrative that doesn't stay with you, the visuals and technical bits of the film will manage to get your attention, and it's the only reason why you should watch it.]"
386,"[Occasionally startling, mostly boring but never scary, this week's Marathi release Aik, directed by Pratik Kadam, is a confused mess of a horror film. The hackneyed treatment of the horror scenes apart, the biggest problem that no one involved in its making seems to have any real idea of what their role in the filmmaking process is.A young couple with a child moves into a spacious apartment in Mumbai that comes their way dirt-cheap. Without too much of a thought into why such a large house in Mumbai is being sold so cheap, they move in, but not before a few hints are provided about an existing otherworldly force in the house. From here, the film shifts to the marital problems that the couple is facing. Before long, the film moves to an abandoned palace near Gujarat, where the husband's TV channel is starting a first-of-its-kind live reality horror show. The story of the film definitely had scope. For instance, one of the interesting things about this film is the nature of the 'haunting'. The reason behind the haunting is unique, and makes logical sense (to the extent that a film about ghosts can) about why these particular people are being haunted. However, it is hard to give the makers of the film too much credit beyond that, because of the manner in which the film has been treated. Starting from the look of the film to the choice of the lead cast and the techniques used to give the audience the chills, everything only gives the impression that a lot of confusion surrounded the making of the film. Swapnil Jadhav and Aditi Sarangdhar, who play the husband and wife respectively, aren't bad, but they just don't look like they can carry a film all by themselves. It is hard to root for them not just because of the manner in which their characters are written, but also because they don't really suit the characters much. The screenplay meanders around too many issues and side characters, particularly during the reality show bits, distracting from what the main purpose of the film is. It takes too long to start getting scary, having already run out of steam by then. The unconvincing content seems worse because of the technique. Shots are repeated with the hope that no one will notice, the cinematography and colour correction is inconsistent and substandard, and the production design is so poor that it often betrays the fact that the film was clearly being made on a really tight budget.Aik can at best be likened to an ambitious student film. The makers of the film had a thought, and had the will to pull it through. What they didn't have is the money and the expertise to make it worth the audience's while.]"
387,"[Let me begin by saying Vettaiyadu Vilayadu is not Gautam Menon's best work. Lauded for making content-heavy ""different"" films, Menon has a pressuring reputation to live up to. This 2006 film starring Kamal Hassan seems like a sequel to his hit film Kaakha Kaakha, with a similar theme of portraying the turbulences of a cop's life. While I still think Minnale is his best film so far, Vettaiyadu Vilayadu is an enthralling watch because of its performances.Kamal Hassan plays a tough, brutal and courageous cop Raghavan, and his larger than life courageous persona is established in the first few scenes itself as he single-handed tackles a bunch of criminals. Hassan as Raghavan is the kind of cop through whom nothing can escape, and even though this is a stereotypical portrayal, you wouldn't expect anything else coming from Hassan. Almost like seeing SRK play a passionate lover. The film carries forward as a series of murders take place in a similar manner - slitting throats, brutally disfiguring young women. Raghavan takes personal interest in the case as his colleague (played by Prakash Raj) Arogyaraj's daughter Rani is one of the deceased victims. After a brilliant performance by Prakash Raj as a grief-stricken father. Here we see a similarity to Kaakha Kaakha, however since the flashback that follows is short it serves as merely an informatory scene. Interspersed with this, is Raghavan's relationship with Aradhna (Jyothika), a girl he meets in his hotel. They have a mellow, engaging chemistry in the film, and Jyothika's de-glam avatar brings out her beauty like never before. You get suitably engrossed in their conversations and it serves as a respite to the fast-paced on goings in the film.Uptil this point, you are thoroughly gripped to the film: calculating your guesses and being cynical trying to figure out who among the people around Raghavan could really be the killer (you've seen enough thrillers to know the killer is always someone you knew and saw through the film). However, halfway through the film the killer is revealed and simply put, you are disappointed. I won't say who or where, but I kept wondering if I was more disappointed with the choice of villain, or whether it was revealed much too early in the film. The thrilling chase then between Raghavan and the killer becomes predictable and largely one-dimensional. You know exactly how the climax is going to be, and at times the predictability gets to you as a viewer, but you are easily distracted by Hassan's screen presence. With all his muscle (some fat too) his brute, over-powering presence convinces you of the scenes nonetheless. Mostly you can't take your eyes off him. The DVD of the film only has a separate compilation of the songs in the film and no other additional features. Music is a trademark pathway to success in most Gautam Menon films; however the music of Vettaiyadu Vilayadu by Harris Jayaraj is mostly confusing - it's neither here nor there with its assortment of overtly westernized beats and traditional melodies to culturally relevant lyrics. This is quite a pity because the Jayaraj-Menon combination has worked extremely well in the past (Kaakha Kaakha and Minnale). I've always held the notion that Gautam Menon's films don't age particularly well because it focuses too much on what is considered to be current and contemporary: be it the background score/music, dialogues or structure. It would have been a better film had it stuck to the age-old tried and tested structure of a murder-suspense. Watch Vettaiyadu Vilayadu however, not because you want to be blown out of your mind but because the film has its moments; best manifested in Jyothika and Kamal Hassan's connection and the performances. It makes for a perfect late-night indulgence film. ]"
388,"[The quality of animation in the Walt Disney logo video (producer), despite repeated views, gets your hopes up for the animation film coming up. And of course, you are disappointed with the first scene. But, it won't be surprising if the money spent on that logo video is close to that spent on the whole Arjun: The Warrior Prince. Given that, I understand it's an unfair expectation and comparison. Even so, the faces and expressions in our animation is far behind.The backdrops on the other hand are much detailed. Even the patterns on clothes and jewelry is pretty intricate. Even the long shots, are conceptualized really well, the colors, the formations in the war sequences are aesthetic. Then, why the lack of imagination in the facial expression department. 2-3 variations each of how eyebrows, eyes and lips move are the only things you see. Same goes for body language and any movement - be it trees, water or animals. All these movements do come across as a few frames are missing between two gross movements. These things take away a lot from the experience of an animated film. Sure, some of these must be a function of money available but a lot of it also comes across as lack of talent. Another department our animated films lack in is the voice animation. That too doesn't have as much variation and thus distracts from the story being told. Mahabharat, the war itself - the events it encompasses, the many characters and their complex relationships - is humungous enough for a movie to cover in entirety. We know, the events leading up to the war are far beyond a single session of story-telling. So, it is indeed unfair to expect a 100-minute to cover it all. And thankfully, Arjun: The Warrior Prince doesn't attempt to do it all either. It clearly conveys that it intends to tell only so much and the rest is either to be looked up outside the film or it indicates that there is a part 2 coming up. However, seeing the war of Kurukshetra as epilogue text was hilarious. Like one would expect, it is assumed that we know of the central characters from earlier on. While I'm glad only few characters are explicitly introduced, the abrupt way in which characters are brought into the picture is rather disconcerting. As if no time was spent in thinking about how and when the character should blend in with the story, case in example, Bhishma Pitamah. Then come some liberties taken with the great epic. While some are acceptable as input by the maker like a tall Gandhari accompanying a short, blind Dhrithrashtra or the short and stout Shakuni (who is the tall Gandhari's brother). But there are others that are a no-no. For example, the way in which the chakravyuha formation of soldiers is shown - it didn't look like a maze at all! Not to mention its use in the Virat war with Arjun and Abhimanyu together is questionable. And a few other such changes in story, while wanting to narrate the story as we know. For a film titled Arjun: The Warrior Prince, I'd expect a lot more of Arjun's point of view. They do try, but it still feels like episodes one might have heard from a grandparent as a bedtime story. There isn't much more insight than that. Arjun: The Warrior Prince works as much as a comic strip book about him would. Except for much more intricate backdrops sans the speech/thought bubbles. ]"
389,"[In spite of the fact that director Chandrakant Kulkarni has to his credit that guilty pleasure Bindhaast in his filmography, his latest film, Tukaram, didn't spawn too many expectations for me, primarily because of the choice of actor to essay the role of one of the most respected and revered saints of Maharashtra. Jitendra Joshi, though not incompetent, has played too many character roles to really be taken seriously. However, his performance in Tukaram grows on you through the length of the film, ultimately leaving you with the feeling that he actually did a decent job.Young Tukaram Ambile is his parents' second child, his older brother being more interested in the ways of God than in earthly life. Because of this, Tukaram shoulders the responsibility of his father's money-lending and trading work fairly early. The film goes on to chronicle the journey of his life, leading up to how he comes to be the mass-popular poet-saint that history now knows him as. Right from the first frame of the film, the authentic feel and setting engulfs you. Not once does the film fall prey to 'modern' gimmickry in terms of technique. Even camera movements are gentle and stable, managing to draw attention to the detailing in the production design. The language and dialogue are an added bonus, contributing immensely in the audience vicariously experiencing life in 17th century Maharashtra.Undoubtedly, the strength of the film is its performances. As mentioned earlier, Jitendra Joshi manages to breathe life into the character of Tukaram, easily making you forget some of the more bizarre character choices he has made in the past. Prateeksha Lonkar, who plays Tukaram's mother, is a joy to watch, like always. Not since Reema Lagoo in the Rajshri films of the 90s has someone made for such a warm screen mother. Sharad Ponkshe as Tukaram's father is excellent as well, managing to switch between being a warm father and businessman with ease. Veena Jamkar and Radhika Apte, playing Tukaram's first and second wives respectively, perform well. Apte, in particular, handles the graph of her character with finesse. Her gradual shift from being young and innocent to being mature and tough is truly exceptional.Yet, Tukaram is not without its flaws. Its most obvious problem is its length. Clocking in at two and three quarters of an hour, the film feels even longer because of its uneven, often slow, pace. Period biopics often find it tough to hold audience attention, and Tukaram falls prey to this as well. The pace slows even more in the latter half of the film, without truly contributing to the story of the saint's life. However, the biggest problem with the film is the graph of Tukaram's character. A human being is most malleable when he is a child and his formative years contribute most to how he is as an adult. Starting off in his childhood, the film abruptly cuts to him being a grown man, thus robbing the film of the impact that the initial reels could potentially have had. Furthermore, Tukaram's adult life has two parts to it - one where he is a man with worldly needs and aspirations, and one where he has renounced materialism in favour of spreading, through his poetry, the word of God. The bridge between these two vastly different characters, the journey between these two extremes had the potential to be far stronger. While a lot of time has been spent detailing these two characters, the connecting link between them has essentially been condensed to just one scene. This scene, though impactful in isolation, is still not enough, not when the two characters are poles apart. Despite its flaws, the film in its entirety makes for an interesting experience. Facets of Tukaram's life that aren't popularly known are brought forth, and the manner in which the cast of the film brings credibility to the characters they play is truly noteworthy. Thus, though Tukaram is far too long for its own good and takes its time to unfold, it still makes for a decent watch because of the performances and the detailed and nuanced production design, which has clearly been worked on with love. ]"
390,"[Malegaon ka Superman - the title sounded funny the first time I heard it, the kind of funny one should avoid. Yet it was intriguing, having known of the little village and a few people from it - those who have suffered the communal riots mentioned in passing in this documentary. What we see is not the film itself, but it's making - a film about the supermen of Malegaon who tried making Malegaon ka Superman. And I haven't seen anything as heart-warming in a really long time.Supermen of Malegaon is soaked in sweet irony. You blink and you might miss one. And it all done without being overt or direct. The simplicity and subtlety with which things are talked about and issues are covered is remarkable - from the intentional mockery of film-making in India to the hypocrisy that a film-maker exhibits in keeping his brother from making a career out of making films.In fact, this making of Malegaon ka Superhero is an advanced lesson on jugaad. The number of innovative fixes to overcome the budget issues while making the film or simple lack of knowledge is just amazing. And these are just the fixes that the documentary decided to focus on. That doesn't mean that we'll like Malegaon ka Superman. But just the number of hilarious things they have Superman do or the characteristics this most unlikely Superman (played by Late Shafique) has might be enough for the ticket money. That besides, how can you not encourage such enterprising filmmakers?Who would've thought we'd be watching a documentary, the making of an almost-no-budget (in today's times) film in  mainstream theaters. We have come a long way, and yet it seems only a beginning - worth celebrating, nonetheless. ]"
391,"[It's a Rohit Shetty film. Which smoothly slides into Anees Bazmee territory and a dash of Priyadarshan 'comedies'. Oh, who am I kidding? Soon, I'm not going to be able to tell the difference. What we know for sure is it is 100% nonstop nonsense. Either you like it or you don't. Or you like the star involved in the ridiculous extravaganza or not. And this time they didn't bother with writing a story. They just picked a classic from yesteryears. Usually with a 'remake' I try to forget/ignore/disregard whatever I know about the original to do full justice to the newer film. But here, try as one might, you aren't allowed to forget the likeness. Time and again, crudely and brutally you are reminded who the makers are paying a tribute to. An exaggerated mimicry of Amol Palekar-Utpal Dutt might work once, but repeating it or making constant references to it only highlights how inept the tribute is. Just calling themselves middle-class doesn't make the characters so, right? The way they dress, whether shoes or make-up deny believability. Oh, there I go again! hmph.So we have Abhishek Bachchan replace Amol Palekar and Ajay Devgan replace Utpal Dutt and you hold back your tears. The interesting point is that this is despite the fact that I like both Abhishek Bachchan and Ajay Devgan as actors. And given the context of the film, the genre, and the director their timing is pretty good and they manage to not annoy you completely despite the characters assigned to them. Especially Abhishek Bachchan as the effeminate Abbas is quite a racket.What I must say is that this must be the best respect(?) homosexuality might have received in mainstream cinema. Sure, he was being laughed at but at least it wasn't mocking and there was some level of acceptance. Some progress. The rest of the cast is as expected, loud and pretty much intolerable except for Asin and Prachi Desai who try to bring in some sort of order and balance to the chaos but of course aren't given enough room. There's a flurry of tributes to other films from Karz to Hrishikesh Mukherjee's other film Khoobsurat. They are all funny conceptually but everything is so loud and disconnected that they work at best as stand-alone one-liners. Not to mention, even the one-liners throughtout the film are no more entertaining than SMS forwards - some jokes at other times inspirational quotes. No, I don't deny it; I wasn't deaf to the resounding laughter at each ridiculous line stuffed with stylized delivery. It's like the Hindi proverb, 'haath kangan ko aarsi kya' that is, 'hand bangle what mirror mirror on the wall?' only imagine that delivered by a muscular Ajay Devgan who makes sure his chest tattoos show just a peek. Yes that's the kind of complete disconnect between the actual proverb, the situation at hand and the humor it tries to use. The humor is indeed to be found in the disconnect. There are a couple instances that are genuinely hilarious. But, the rest of them find their laughs because of how silly it sounds. I, however, could enjoy the humor only a couple of times. Oh, and the action is also a letdown from usual Rohit Shetty standards. Many sequences have the sound design, the camera and the editing do the action instead of Ajay Devgan and Abhishek Bachchan.Everything is too over-the-top, too loud, too in-the-face. There is just way too much room the writers give themselves so that the audience can leave their brains behind. Only that, I am a part of that audience who doesn't want to or rather who couldn't be convinced to. Ps. 'haath kangan ko aarsi kya' means 'you don't need a mirror to look at your bangle/bracelet - you don't need a mirror to see the obvious']"
392,"[Do you remember the days from when you were younger, when you went crazy about something or the other? Trading cards, dolls, a cricketer, a film star, a fellow classmate? Through most of Kshay, Chhai's (Rasika Dugal) obsession with Goddess Laxmi made me think of her as that obsessed child. One who would claim, ""you don't understand!"" to anyone who tried to talk him out of that mania which he thought was perfectly valid. And slowly you see a few adults you know in Chhai's eyes. Their obsession might be different money, power or fame - but the similarity is stark. And while you realize it is counter-productive if not shallow, they don't give up. Kshay is a story that symbolizes exactly that.The parallel doesn't stop there. The irony, that to please Goddess Laxmi, the goddess of wealth - even though she's not asking for it - requires money, never leaves you. Also, Kshay's fixation with people who are fixated for only one thing and none else is shown through the black and white palate, like no other color exists for them, like life has no other shades. Though the same cannot be said about its charactes. Chhai, her husband Arvind, their neighbor Shruti - all are varying shades of gray. They are real, they reach out to you, and you worry for them however tiny their role be. The villain is surely stark black, but then again he is representing the concretized brutality of the business world, this once the construction business. Arvind on the other hand is the perfect example of the guy chasing a dream, one who looks so tired from the chasing that he's willing to accept a compromise, were there someone making an offer.Yet, there are some dots in the script that seem like they don't connect and I it is indeed perplexing. But, if you allow yourself to accept Chhai's fanaticism, you realize that in her world the connection makes perfect sense. Or greater still, her world requires no connection. But, even if she is visibly mentally disturbed, she is supposed to resemble us and our own obsession.Therein lies my only but biggish problem with Kshay. It is not because Kshay can disengage you in the first few minutes with its non-standard and thus absurd sounds and overt attempt at being abstract. It is this niggling feeling that I have with most films that fall in this realm, why do they go that extra length to make the audience figure out the point of the film. I'm not saying you should spoon-feed us, but why do you have to go out of your way to make a simple objective look something more intellectual than it ultimately is. Isn't there a gray between the black and white? The good news though is that once I accept that that is the route Kshay has taken, it is an engaging film.  A film that certainly should be lauded as an indie project that saw light after four years of effort by a group of debutantes. ]"
393,"[When S S Rajamouli announced that he is going to make a revenge saga of a housefly and that too not on the lines of Bug's life, I was appalled to say the least. Now how can a tiny insect attempt to kill a man? Even if he had chosen the blood sucking mosquito as his protagonist there could be some plausibility to the idea. But this is from the director who convinced everyone south of vindhyas of a warrior who could fight and win over 100 soldiers at a time. S S Rajamouli the director with the Midas touch sure must have known what he was doing. The end result is a buzzy little creature called Eega (Housefly) that could give bumblebee a run for its honey at being audaciously capable of doing the impossible.In its screen time of 2+ hours, Eega not just defies almost all laws of nature, but also breaks tons of cliches associated with a masala film while proudly being one. For one, though the title role of Eega is the star of the film, the film relies primarily on its antagonist's angst against the petite fly, portrayed menacingly by Sudeep (known to the Hindi audience through Phoonk). Notwithstanding the fact that his role is modeled on the character Raghuveer (from Magadheera - another Rajamouli film) Sudeep is able to infuse a different persona which effectively evokes sympathy for a computer generated Fly.While Sudeep gets to be a livewire, Samantha unlike the heroines in a superhero/masala film gets to be more than the trusted aide to the efficacious fly. This is a far cry from the heroines of the director's previous films, who were deployed mainly to paint the screen with voyeurism. (Rajamouli is the man behind the original version of now successful Rowdy Rathore).For a movie that revolves around three principle characters, S S Rajamouli should be applauded for intelligently intertwining their actions that test one another's strengths and weaknesses, to move the plot forward. But for a movie that is targeting all ages, it is unabashedly gory, a point that parents of toddlers should think over before taking them to the silver screen. Not only that, the glorified-immature romance that play out in the first few minutes of the film lurks us back to the films in 80s, where men were loafers  pursuing the job of wooing the heroine.These slight glitches apart, S S Rajamouli can be proud of creating a fantasy film without compromising on the Indian sensibilities, that is going to make film lovers throughout the world turn their attention towards India and Indian cinema. In line with the famous Tamil saying, S S Rajamouli &amp; his Eega have certainly proved that 'Vallavanukku pullum ayudham' (even a blade of grass is a weapon for the victor).]"
394,"[Love transcends generations. True love transcends logic. Romantic relationships were the same a hundred years ago and will live their viciously circular life for ages to come. Most of us know this first-hand, yet there are some parts of our lives we don't mind watching Priyanka Chopra and Shahid Kapoor enact. But, three times is two times too much. Teri Meri Kahaani takes the concept a little too seriously and offers no variety in the sameness of love over a century. One of the things Teri Meri Kahaani tries to convey is that when love is at first sight; when connections seem magical; when vibes run too strong to ignore - it could imply a deeper bond. A bond that crosses life-times. A beautiful thought that. But writer, Kunal Kohli doesn't  do anything exceptional with this lovely theme. Teri Meri Kahaani ends up being the same ol' love story repeated in a span of two hours.One would then think that the way the three stories tie in would mean something more than just, 'it's meant to be'. Unfortunately, the climax which builds up nicely is a damp squib. Yet, the film holds up because of the performances, some sparkling dialogue and the inherent sweetness of romantic relationships as they are when they start.We see Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra disarm each other with their charm thrice and if it doesn't get tiring it is only because of their performances. Many moments and lots of chemistry keep you engaged in them as actors, even if the story and characters aren't all that interesting. This is despite the fact that all three characters that each one of them play are almost the same, except for Ruksar who is a meek yet popular film star. Both Radha and Aradhana are strong personalities who know what they want out of life. On the other hand, Govind, Krissh and Javed are all arrogant smart-Alecks. It's amazing then that Priyanka Chopra and Shahid Kapoor manage to emote with a wide variety and bring some flavor to their three almost similar characters. I especially enjoyed what Shahid Kapoor does with Javed. Prachi Desai in her short presence leaves you feeling for her, more so because of the way she portrays the way her character faces the truth. Neha Sharma annoys well as the 'typical girlfriend' character. The rest of the supporting cast has nothing that makes you notice them, but I just don't get why such awful actors are chosen to play the British officers.The period setting of the 1950s is cute - it doesn't look authentic at all, but the textile industry from the times when Phoneix Mills was actually a mill does give you a flavor of the era. So does Shahid Kapoor's  tribute to Charlie Chaplin and Kunal Kohli's tribute to the silent era. On the other hand the culture depicted from those times in terms of say how a girl would behave in a small village in the 1910s or dress in a Bombay chawl in the 1950s is very difficult to digest. And lovely poetry aside, is nothing sacred about the freedom struggle - an energetic, completely romantic  song in the middle of a jail!? Really?There is no difficulty on the other hand in accepting the role technology plays in romance of the 2010s. Neither is it difficult to accept the nastiness of the woman scorned. Bits engage you; parts make you smile, laugh and LOL; and many chunks make you wonder why this film couldn't be at least a little different from just three love stories hurriedly put together. ]"
395,"[Maximum is depressing. It looks like a play between two policemen who are neither at the top of the department nor at the lowest ranks, so they do have a decent amount of power each. But indeed, there are many more, more important characters. Like the umpteen underworld films it is not a war between good and evil, or wrong and right. It is just human beings, each being their own shade of gray. That makes for perfect 'enjoyable story' material despite lack of relatable characters you can root for. Yet, once you get over the sadness that overwhelms you while you watch police officers do what goons do, only with more authority, you realize it is just one of those gang war films. And that's the most depressing bit about Maximum. That a war between two policemen is nothing short of a gang war - thematically and morally. Of course, I'm not saying any of what is shown in the film comes as a shock. If there is goonism and business in politics; politics and goonism in business, why should it come as a surprise that there is goonism, business and politics within law enforcement. Yet, it made me uncomfortable when policemen shot goons down because the were the others' informers or when one had to pay another to save an informer. For this discomfort, for some good performances, for a good start, Maximum might be worth your while, if you were looking forward to it.On the other hand, except for the first half hour or so, there is a lot of dramatization, lots of motifs and symbols thrown in your face and many such pitfalls that a director falls in, in trying to do all the cool things in one film. Maximum spreads itself thin even in terms of giving space to its characters. It is always a tough task to do justice to all the main characters even they are in small roles, especially when they are being played by such good actors. From Naseeruddin Shah and Sonu Sood to Dr. Mohan Agashe, Vinay Pathak to Rajendra Gupta, Neha Dhupia, Amit Sadh - each one make you believe in their character. Most of them make you feel for them at some small level, which is a lot for a film that is a 'goon' story at its heart.Even though you cannot be satisfied with exposure given to most of their characters, you appreciate the attempt at giving them some depth. Which is why the lack of detail to Naseeruddin Shah's character, Inamdaar, seems unfair. While you know almost all there is to Sonu Sood's Pandit, there is very little you know of Inamdaar's background, character or motivations. And despite these shortcomings, Maximum plays out well as an interesting story, especially in the beginning where the meat of the story lies. Close to interval, the pace drops and never picks up after that. The soporific background music and constant use of slow-motion doesn't help. Neither does the constant punctuation by item numbers under the guise of the policemen's dance bar visits. I also liked the symbolic survival of innocence, honesty(?) and loyalty.Maximum felt like it had an interesting story to tell but got lost in its way amongst lots of intriguing characters and too many things to tell. A little prioritization might have allowed the writer and director to focus on what the story was about. ]"
396,"[For those of you who still remember Sam Raini's Spiderman trilogy vividly, (considering the last film was out barely 5 years ago) Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man (director of well-acclaimed indie film 500 Days of Summer) might not have anything new to offer in the larger picture. But don't we all love superhero films for its portrayal of the underdog-nerd who turns into a crime-fighter? While The Amazing Spider-Man doesn't toy with the basic graph of the film, it has enough to grab your attention and ensure a thrilling, enjoyable viewing experience.The story is more or less the same: Of a gawky-lanky Peter Parker as he discovers that he is meant for greater things. After many years of questioning his parent's mysterious disappearance, we are shown his warm surroundings with Uncle Ben and Aunt May (played by the charming Martin Sheen and Sally Field). He then encounters his father's former partner Dr Curt Connor's (Rhys Ifans) genius genetic research and lends a missing algorithm to complete the research.By then he's already been bitten by the spider, and is trying to grapple with his superpowers. He's also going through a teenage puppy infatuation with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Their chemistry is much more developed and crackling, which is a vast difference from the sense of achievement that you feel with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst's (from previous Spiderman films) heart-warming union. It works, regardless of the differences, because of their performances. Emma Stone is sparkling and plays the kind of girl that young boys write sonnets about (or at least the poetically inclined ones). It makes their coming together that much more magical because their chemistry has a solid build up, devoid of any meant-to-be-together undertones. Rhys Ifans as the Lizard is menacing; although you recognize the need for a more sinister villain. The scenes between Spiderman and the lizard are visually gripping though, mostly due to John Schwatrzman's swift cinematography and James Horner's grand-crescendo type background score.Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker is a more nervy, nerdy teenager which works extremely well in this re-telling because the film becomes a coming of age story more than anything. While he's not a spectacled, dorky nerd, he plays the part of an outsider (the kind that prefers his skateboard to actual human company) with precision. It's the kind of performance where you're nearly expecting him to collapse with the pressure he attains after successfully transforming into Spiderman, but you know his sense of responsibility is large (You don't miss the iconic line, ""With great power comes great responsibility"", and that is a big win for writers James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves)The Amazing Spider-Man works, mostly because of the minor nuances that have been paid attention to, to make for a fresh viewing. Be it in Parker and Gwen Stacy's smile-inducing chemistry, a brief viewing of Parker's parents, the homemade costume and the fact that the spider-web in this film is web-made as opposed to the organic web from Raini's Spiderman - all only add to the charm of the film. You're able to watch the film without making compulsive comparisons to the earlier films and you're able to love it all the same. For that reason, The Amazing Spider-Man is a must watch. ]"
397,"[Disclaimer: Amen is based on the true life story of Harish Iyer. Harish is a friend and an inspiration. Amen is currently stuck at the censor board which has refused the 'A' (Adult certificate) because of explicit sexual content. Also, this review is for adults only.Update: The DVD is now available here. Go get your copy. Amen is a beginner's lesson in homosexuality, Homosexuality 101 so to speak. And thus it also teaches us about our homophobia. Not so much the semantics of how it's done, but Amen unveils the various myths associated with homosexuality. Given our immaturity as a society on the subject, it is a much-needed lesson. Amen's focus is clearly on showing the human side to gay people. The frustration that it comes from is apparent. Gay people are misunderstood as different and thus 'heartless' and Amen tries to show you what the misunderstanding is all about. Andy and Harry meet through an online community and Andy hasn't come to terms with his sexuality. He represents us, as a society. From his attitude towards his own sexual orientation to the sexual abuse that Harry faced as a child. The latter, though only one of the elements in Amen, is a genuine concern for us as a society and specifically young parents. Actors, Karan Mehra and Jitin Gulati bring the insecurities and resignation faced by gay people with brilliant sensitivity. In times when homosexuals are used in Indian films mainly as comic relief, or rather to be ridiculed, Karan and Jitin's bravery is beyond applause. It's not only bold, what they portrayed, but it also takes pluck and a strong spine to take the risk, as far their careers are concerned too. The characters are simple and the relationship issues are normal, if you take out the homosexual angle. And that is the main point that Amen tries to make. It is simple, it is normal. There should be no necessity to emphasize it. The opening sequence of the film is extremely uncomfortable. In a culture where two flowers coming together symbolizes sexual attraction and at many a time intercourse itself; straightforward and to-the-point sexual intimacy between two men is naturally going to make one awkward. But, the uneasiness is in us. And it's high time we deal with it. Just for the dearth of films based on the subject, Amen is a must-watch. Sure, there are bits that come across as preachy because of the point that the film is trying to make. It also felt like a documentary, an awareness film made palatable by use of a human story wrapped around relatable characters. Amen is a quick watch at less than 25 minutes. And compared to the innumerable violent and sexually explicit 'item' numbers that make their entry into Bollywood Friday-after-Friday, Amen is a film that needs to see a release. One of cinema's job description is to educate, isn't it the duty of the censor board as the education ministry then to allow what needs to be publicly acceptable knowledge? P.S. Fact file:Amen has been funded by Valentina Erath, who Harish knew only on twitter before she got involved in the film. She has now turned into his strength and is like a sibling.Similarly, Harish didn't know the music director, Jonathan Fessenden from earlier on either. He was found on imdbHarish Iyer has been receiving many e-mails from child sex abuse survivors and homosexuals offering their support and telling them that they connected with the film.]"
398,"['Whacky' - every frame of Gangs of Wasseypur reeks of it. Imagine that in film set in the interiors of Jharkhand. The language, the characters, the dynamics of their relationship with each other, the songs that play in the background all add to the rugged, earthy feeling of the film. An experience very few directors in India can provide. Yet, it is not self-sufficient. As a story the experience is incomplete because we know we have watched only half a film. There's more to come and what we saw so far is not a film that stands alone. Much like its characters, Wasseypur has been pushed from here to there at hands of destiny and the world has been very matter-of-factly about it. In typical documentary tone you are told how Wasseypur has moved from Bengal to Bihar to now Jharkhand over 40-odd years. It is almost ironical when the voice behind that tone, Piyush Mishra is consoling a woman whose husband has cheated on her comment on her destiny. Many a time it does come across as a docu-drama that Anurag Kashyap wants to use to document the messed up system that most of India lived in since independence. Gangs of Wasseypur is a story Wasseypur's story, where Wasseypur itself represents the many small towns in this country that suffer at the hands of politicians and goons. You can't even call it the underworld because the perpetrators are so blatant about the fear they want to induce with their power.  At the same time, humor is infused and character of the film is built with time references to various films along the way. Almost as a pointer to the Bollywood-centric theme that part II is promised to have. While Gangs of Wasseypur touts itself as a revenge saga, you will realize it is a lot more. An anti-hero as a protagonist who finds it difficult to go without sexual release. He almost always comes across as the underdog because of the situations that he gets himself into and often he looks like he is making a fool of himself. Yet he is tender at heart for the people he really cares about. The dry humor used only adds to that judgement. You can't but wonder how his experiences as a son might have changed the equation with his sons. Strong women who aren't lead ladies by Hindi film standards - they are proud of how brutally the men of their lives use power against the entire world (except for them), a staunch friend, a few double crossers, sons who find it difficult to get out of their dad's shadow even though they hate him, all don't let Gangs of Wasseypur remain a standard revenge saga.Yes, it is violent. Yes, it does try to make the same ol' point that revenge films have always tried - that it is futile because too many people on all sides die too gory a death. But Gangs of Wasseypur goes beyond that, it has characters who represent dissent - to them truce is not an option, never. Very few 'gang war' films allow room to those people who were bruised so bad that they cannot forgive. Also you see that exiting the trade is not an option. Even if a goon wants to mend his ways, if he is high profile enough, whatever business he gets into will invite unhealthy attention from rivals. To single out any one or two actors as being good at their job might imply that the others weren't as good and that woul be plain wrong. And what about the other stars of the film - the outstanding music, the way each film uses natural sources of light and keeps artificial ones at minimum, the fairly simple but amazingly perfect composition of frames, the three or four times slow-motion is used, especially in the last scene, the background score that becomes outright crazy given the context it is used in. No review would be complete without mentioning these heroes.Gangs of Wasseypur may demand patience from some of the viewers, but I enjoyed the pace and the time it took to settle down. It's like reading beautiful prose, whether or not you like what is written, you admire the way it is written. More often than not, you find yourself wondering if this is India's very own Godfather. Yet, it doesn't take away from the nagging incomplete feeling. Though what it also means is you are asking for the more you have been promised with utmost eagerness. Ps. What is it about use of abusive language in films that makes young adult males giggle like teenage girls? ]"
399,"[This has been a year of a large number of progressive, yet forgettable films. Starting with Mirror Mirror and Snow White and The Hunstmen, both of which are bolder adaptations of the age-old Snow White fairytale. The focus has been on subverting the largely patriarchal undertones that fairy tales impart with. Pixar's newest film Brave immediately caught everyone's attention with its trailers, involving a gallant, motor-mouth girl protagonist (for the first time in 17 years) with archery ambitions. Princess Merida (the protagonist) is feisty, but Brave is predictable, preachy and yes, forgettable.Brave tells the story of Merida (voice of Kelly Macdonald), who feels stifled by her mother's conditioned upbringing. Her mother (Emma Thompson) tries her best to raise Merida like a lady, but Merida's interests lie in horse-back riding, archery and adrenalin-pumping activities. It all comes crumbling down for her when she is summoned to wed her father's fellow clan chief's son. Fundamentally, the fact that a young girl is used as a protagonist is charming - you have a Hunger Games - Katniss Evergreen hangover but soon the predictable story-line takes over and pours water all over your expectations. There is humour in many of the beginning scenes, between her father King Fergus and her mother (typical husband-wife banter over the child). The Scottish countryside is beautifully animated, with its myriad of colors and depth in landscape - and it's a relief to have a different geographical region being portrayed in the film. My biggest issue with Brave though is the fact that no other character is even remotely as memorable as Merida. Merida herself stands out visually, because of her hair and her Scottish accent. The witch could have been much more menacing, more in the lines of Cruella DeVille (101 Dalmations) or Ursula (The Little Mermaid). A memorable villain always makes the pursuit of the protagonist double-fold, and therefore, coupled with predictably paced action scenes, the film becomes monotonous towards the latter half. Brave had immense potential - the protagonist Merida is visually memorable and relatable. She's the kind of character who if treated well, could have a roaring fan following among children. Coupled with an original story-line, a menacing villain and a certain universal quality that so much of Pixar's earlier films have, it could have been a charming film. As it is, however, Brave is a letdown. ]"
400,"[These alternate universes are making it more and more difficult to deal with reality. Ofcourse, then some of you will argue about how you can tell what is real. But before we can go there, let me warn you that watching Prometheus in 3D IMAX will leave you with an abyss of questions and discussions about the possibilities of the human existence. What's new about that? Believe me, you can never have enough of speculation, and Ridley Scott works on that exact sentiment, playing with your mind with every second of Prometheus. An epic-size prequel to the 1979 Alien, three decades later, Prometheus is a grand film. It's all about the visuals, jaw-dropping and mesmerizing as they are, making the art direction and VFX near flawless. You can't take your eyes of the grandeur, but you are forced to once you move ahead to try and answer the questions the film poses. The film begins in 2093, when archeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) are convinced of the existence of extra-terrestrial beings courtesy ancient cave paintings.They then set out on an expedition to reach the home planet of these beings on a ship called Prometheus, along with the Crew Commander Meredith Vickers (an icy Charlize Theron), a cheeky Captain Jenek (Idris Elba), the creepy, straight-faced android David (Michael Fassbender) and a bunch of geologists and technicians. Their mission to find these beings and their universe is funded by multi-billionaire Peter Wayland (Guy Pearce, whose casting quite doesn't make any sense).Every moment of the film after they land on the planet is gripping, leaving you with not even a moment to catch a breath. What stays with you for many hours after the film is the arresting imagery of the film. It's a combination of break-taking visuals, haunting sound design and smooth cinematography that finally give off a sense of calm surprise. Where Prometheus lacks is in its theoretical questions - the answers of which are hinted at in the future sequel. Having brought up the regular Science versus Faith debate, it doesn't take it's time to establish both sides but rather, conveniently places its ideological stance. On one hand, Scott raises relevant questions about human creation and the basis of our existence; he had immense scope to toy around with the idea and leave you at a peak. However, the film quickly moves to showing a spectacular picture instead and leaves the audience confused. It's not a confusion of questions (because who doesn't like that) but a confusion of choice - why was a particular situation chosen to be portrayed in this manner? The answers are made to seem like they are irrelevant, trivial or worse, patched up with a fast-paced following scene. As a viewer, one hopes it'll all be rounded in the sequel, but that is a lot of pressure on one film, especially since its finale was made 30 years ago.Prometheus' true star is Michael Fassbender as the uncanny android David. His character keeps you on tenterhooks through the film and continues to wow you inevery frame. Following which, each character is well cast. CharlizeTheron plays the icy ship manager, and Noomi Rapace, as a believing, alert protagonist - the kind that every viewer likes to lead a film. Scott's story-telling technique is extremely vivid. You can see how every shot was elaborately planned and bound, and the effort shows on screen. The 3D was subtle, and yet you could see how it enhanced your viewing experience. For the visuals alone, watch Prometheus. To say that it will blow your mind is a given. The movie however, will stay with you for many days after you see it - you'll be burdened with questions, some even nagging. You deserve the experience. ]"
401,"[The brand-combination Rajkumar Hirani-Vidhu Vinod Chopra invariably brings a warm film, fairly well-made film. They make very simple use of the tools, no glitter, no glamor, no grit or grim either. Just an outlandish yet sweet story and a very strict focus on their intention, on what it is they want to convey this time. They do touch upon many side issues that come along organically, but they don't lose sight of the basic issue they take up. And like every other time they manage to make me forgive the irritants and go with the flow and enjoy their film for what it is.I'm not taking anything away from director, Rajesh Mapuskar for all the good things going for the film. Just the performances alone make him worthy of all the credit he deserves. It's just that the Hirani-VVC stamp is so resounding in the story-telling. A 12-year old, Kayo (Ritvik Sahore) is good with the cricket bat, exceptionally good. But his curse is that his dad, Rustom (Sharman Joshi) can't afford a training camp in London which Kayo so deserves to go to. Another deterrent is a disgruntled and non-supportive grandfather, Deboo (Boman Irani). And then you join in on a fun trip on how Rustom makes sure his son's aspirations are met. The means Rustom uses put the film in fantasy zone. But, the makers want exactly that - to suck you into the unbelievability of the basic plot and make you root for its characters. Characters which have been beautifully developed. So warm they are, that you let go of your need for unpredictability. Rustom is introduced to you as the ideal citizen who, given his background and the premise of the story, will have to at some point sell his soul. You know Deboo is in dire need of a cathartic moment and he'll have to find it in the next two hours or so. And yet, the how is engaging and entertaining.This brand's weakness for coming up with an over-the-top, even more unbelievable climax is well-known. And they pretty much stick to it. But hey, a few beautiful moments, some wonderful scenes between characters, a heart that's warming you from the inside as you walk out of the theater - if these are the takeaways, why not? But for a moment or two, the climax sticks to the overall tone of the story thus far. The things that happen in those couple of moments are annoying but the quibble in the head dissolves as you accept it, even if grudgingly so.The many issues the film touches upon either in passing or with a little more importance than that and the subtlety with which it's done reaches out to you. From the standard potshot at media behavior and a little more elaborate one at the bureaucracy in Indian sports and well the, law &amp; administration to the irony of Sachin Tendulkar and his Ferrari - Ferrari Ki Sawari covers a broad spectrum.Parenting - the basic theme that it covers - is the one that attaches the film to its audience. The father-son-father relationship is handled with such brilliant charm. It is a battle of generations, it is a battle of parenting styles. The manner in which Rustom (along with Kayo's coach) handles Kayo's aspirations and behavior issues can serve as a parenting guide. In contrast, only to show a mirror to the regular, and if I may add, Indian parenting methodology you have Rustom's dad and another relationship between a politician and his son. Of utmost importance is the missing mother or in fact, any significant female character. And the one woman in a supporting role has very little feminine about her (which is also subtly alluded to in a scene where she just about passes of as a man). As a woman, I am glad Ferrari Ki Sawaari was conscious to keep the lady-factor out. Behind all the Sachin-Sachin and Ferrari-Ferrari the film harps about, is a very strong thread of the relationship of a child with his father. A role that only HE can play. That I haven't mentioned the fantastic performances so far is a testimony to how much else there is going on in the film. Boman Irani - oh what a performer! - his stagger, the lopside of his mouth, the tongue sticking out demonstrating the slug that his life has turned him into, and I can go on. Rustom's simple-mindedness wouldn't have come across if it wasn't for Sharman Joshi's demeanor. Even Seema Bhargava as the jugaadu event manager is as real as any Bombayite could get. Aakash Dhabade as Sachin Tendulkar's domestic help is a huge take away from the film. The small exchange between Paresh Rawal and Boman Irani itself is worth the ticket money for an ardent film-lover.Yes, it would have worked better if the film was shorter. Yes, a few extra characters could have been avoided to make the film crisper. But Ferrari ki Sawaari wasn't intended to be crisp, it was intended to give you that lovely feeling inside. That feeling of having giving in to the fantasy, the feeling of being inspired and involved while watching a fun film, the feeling of having watched a decent film. ]"
402,"[We as a people want progress. We as a people are disturbed when a section of the society is wronged to achieve this progress. When it comes to 'our' progress, we as a people don't mind collateral damage. Dibakar Banerjee's Shanghai, portrays our aspirations as a people to want to be a 'progressive' nation. A deep concept, with multi-layered connotations and meaningful characters starts seeming half-baked post half-time and is made utterly regular by the end. The age ol' nexus between business, politics, law and administration is yet again scratched and left at just that. What is 'realistic' to the eye ceases to be realistic to the brain after teasing you with details and references that you aren't otherwise used to in a Hindi film.A guy from the 'good' side is a professor, a rebel, fighting on behalf of the wronged and has a thing for his female students - that's what you aren't used to in a Hindi film. A strong female protagonist whose father is implicated in a multi-crore Rupee scam finds herself helpless, has fallen for her married teacher, and yet manages to create empathy towards her - that's what you aren't used to in a Hindi film. A typical politician who genuinely believes in and is concerned about the leader of his party, despite being powerful in his own right - that's what we aren't used to in a Hindi film. For goodness sake, an Emraan Hashmi whose acting capabilities are explored - that's what you are not used to in a Hindi film! And yet by the end you come out feeling that the writers tried to pull wool over your eyes with all of these interesting departures and came up with a sham of an over-simplified climax.  Some things are pleasantly surprising. Sub-plots begin and are left without resolution; you are told things about characters and their inter-relationships using subtlest of details just because - for no apparent reason in terms of the story - these things lend to the beauty of the film and its inherent chaos. Many a time, Dibakar Banerjee chooses to pause, take a breather, gives an extra moment to take the ambience in and these moments strike a chord between the audience and the characters.  That the characters are played by some fine actors only adds to its believability. That Abhay Deol could have sleep-walked as the taken-for-granted senior bureaucrat who is struggling with his conscience only means that we have begun to take his acting skills for granted. I do wish though that his generic South Indian accent was given a pass. Emraan Hashmi, you have to watch, I ain't elaborating on how cool it is to see him so comfortable with something so out of his regular zone. Kalki Koechlin gets to do a repeat of her strong-lady-in-distress role. The smaller roles though are the ones that really stick in Shanghai. From Pitobash Tripathi who has his own kind of screen presence to Prosenjit Chatterjee and Supriya Pathak whose omnipresence is felt throughout despite really short roles to Farouque Shaikh whose presence is strangely comforting to even Anant Jog who plays one of the few representatives of the people who are wronged and are being manipulated by politicians. The problem then comes back to the cop-out of a climax, one that is build up towards really well. And there are other details that seem out of place. For example, the satire in the lyrics of 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' sound more like it'll be sung by the protestors rather than supporters of the ruling party. Yet, interesting, fairly relatable characters are staged on a familiar stage - that of corruption, red-tape and dishonesty. A system that you and I are frustratingly trapped in we want to see the characters wade out of it so that we see light for ourselves. But from this realistic milieu you are thrown into reality - that this is still fiction and life is obviously not going to be as easy as it is for these characters. It boils down to this then - what makes a movie good for you? What are you ok with letting go off, if the rest of it got you hooked? If what you are looking for is some serious, no-nonsense drama, most of Shanghai has it for you. But, if you end up disappointed when build-up towards the climax remains unsatiated, you will come out with that upset feeling. You know where I am. ]"
403,"[Men in Black 3 has all the reasons to remind you why you loved the first film. It's revives the same recipe that made Men in Black  such a success over a decade ago: many laugh-out-loud moments, roaring chemistry between actors, a nemesis worth his salt and a film that doesn't solely rely on VFX heavy sequences to define action.Men in Black 3 is uninhibited, the chemistry between Jones and Smith is crackling and the movie makes you feel nostalgic about the last time you were in the theatre watching the first part. (I'm deliberately excluding the 2nd part of the series; let's just call that one a derailed attempt.)This time around, Agent J is sent back in time to 1969 to prevent their nemesis Boris the Animal, (crazy and convincing alien performance by Jemaine Clement) from killing Agent K. This task lies at the fundamental of restoring the agency's security, which is now headed by Agent O (Emma Thompson). This leap back in time involves Smith jumping from a 40-storied bulding in New York, and don't we all just love that? Well, that was just the beginning. The next few hours of the film will have you duly entertained, not majorly because of a hooking plot but the growing relationship between Agent J and a younger Agent K (played by Josh Brolin). Brolin as a younger K is absolutely bang-on with his mannerisms and you find yourself wondering in awe if he was ever a choice for the original role of Agent K. Smith is his usual humorous self, and their growing friendship plays out as a backdrop to the dire need to save K from a snarling and menacing Borris.Back in the 60s, you find yourself convinced that a time-leap has been made. The set, costumes and characteristics are infact, very 60s. Unlike the first film however, where the charm lay in its unpredictable humour that caught you off-guard, Men in Black 3 possesses a subtle version of that same humour. You do find yourself being engrossed with the happenings, mostly by the contrasts between the two characters (Brolin is serious and unaware, and Smith is constantly jabbering), but you do find yourself always hoping for more, for the plot/characters/action to jump that extra mile. Which they don't.Much like the first film, you are rewarded with action-packed fight sequences and the right amount of special effects, although the 3D seemed a bit forceful and could be done away with. Men in Black 3 is a must watch for those of you loved the first film - its a rightful journey of nostalgia. For those of you who haven't followed the series - watch the film for Will Smith, who's always a stellar performer, and for a reminder of how fantasy films were made in the 90s. ]"
404,"[As hard as it is to believe, Tees Maar Khan subtly remarks about the state of the country. National treasure being passed on from the administrative authorities to thugs. What else is it, if it is not a commentary, when the same thugs make a mockery of the law and order system - standing smack in the middle of a courtroom? All this by a ""con artist"" pulling off a heist almost as if he has the blessings of the police. Trying to make sense out of the non-stop chaos that the rest of the film is, these subtleties may seem like accidents. But, you have to give this one to them. Using a village full of village fools as representatives, the filmmakers are certainly pointing a big fat finger at us, the audience who laps up this stuff in the name of masala.I didn't grow up watching Keislowski and Fellini. Far from it. I was brought up to love masala-makers turned filmmakers.  I laughed and cried with the actors and the characters they played. Then too, it was a world ruled by stars. But now I laugh with contempt and weep at only one person - me. A part of the audience. How and when did definition of masala entertainment change from a coherent story to a broadly set-up plot strung together with the most plainly written sub-sequences? When did strong romantic undercurrent transform into Sheila romancing her own jawaani or the hero overtly and superficially caring about her modesty? The only thing that seems to have come through the decades is the random breaking into song and dance. Oh well, Jai Ho? I agree Katrina Kaif played the annoying bimbo to perfection, but then, was it acting at all? I don't mean this as an insult, I just question her choice of a role. I cannot even bring myself to comment on Akshay Kumar's loud utterances of words that seem to be getting at a sentence. Because most of the time, he's either saying ""ta...f ki izzat ..something..tees maar khan...something..."" or is just narrating what's going to happen in the story in the next 20 minutes. Incidentally the word ""tawaif"" (haaaw, I said it!) is beeped out as per censor requirements. And I think Farah Khan has the last laugh on this one because what we end up hearing is ""beeeep..f..ki izzat..."" That one cracked me up. And a couple of other jokes. I know you are supposed to laugh at the silliness. But I demand that the silliness be funny not lame. I'd like to respect the woman (Farah) for making a film, it's a difficult process, I admit. But, I'd like a little respect in return, for my sense and sensibility.]"
405,"[An exciting start introduces you to a gamut of cartoon characters who largely represent real-life stereotypes but have potential to entertain. Unfortunately, the length of the film is restricted by the attention span of the target audience, clearly under 10. Hence, no justice can be done to any of those characters. So, you are left with a mish-mash of characters that just about stay together as a story. A story of a father wanting to be a hero for his kids, so what if it is fighting cartoons with the help of cartoons.I'm sure kids below ten will enjoy the film, its gimmickry, slapstick included. But, I don't really like the idea of well-endowed women trying to move it and attract the attention of a man they woo by calling him handsome and hot. More so because these women are animated and meant to entertain kidsSure, there's more to the film than the vamp, the anti-vamp and the wife who's insecure of women in sketch. I liked the bit where a dad's presence at a school race is more important to a child than the race itself. Similarly, it felt warm to see the importance a dad gives to his son's admonition and name-calling because the dad sees truth in it. But this warmth fizzles out as characters are introduced and you are disconnected slowly and surely from one and all. You don't root for anyone and you aren't scared for anyone's safety because of the threat the villain poses. In fact, the villain isn't given enough screen time to make an impact at all; most of it is hogged by Ajay Devgn and his childish antics. This is even more evident when some room is given to ""rub-doot"", a cartoon eraser. Those 5-7 minutes of his screen time are thoroughly enjoyable. I wish more such fun times were spent writing meatier bits for other characters. Over and above being superior to animation done thus far, we need some superior writing - animation or not. The wonderful glimpse you get makes you wonder, why you couldn't have had more. For those few moments, I just might send my kids to watch the film. Or maybe will have them wait for the DVD to be out on rent. Or maybe not. Or whatever.]"
406,"[No one, (yes, including me), walks in to watch Yamla Pagla Deewana expecting an intense experience or a strong story line. Everyone is in there to have a good laugh, come out, and laugh that they laughed. And a scene or two that stick in the head, even after you are out, is a bonus. Even with my expectations being what they should be, I found very few funny or entertaining bits. I'm talking of earthen pots pausing in mid-air in pseudo-Matrix fashion. Only to be lamely put away by Sunny Deol's ""dhai kilo ka haath.""  Creativity, element of surprise is not for this filmmaker. The actors, well, they do whatever Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol and (today's) Dharmendra can do. I was worried I wouldn't be able to hear the dialogue in the middle of all the hooting. But it wasn't a concern at all. The trio is louder beyond that. After all, it is supposedly a prerequisite for the genre. Kulraj Randhwa's role exists so there is some sort of coherence to the planned chaos that the film is. As usual, I was disheartened to see Anupam Kher do a role which demeans his talent.The blatant disregard for the 'writing' department is so obvious that I cannot really complain about how the character establishment of Dharmendra and Bobby Deol as conmen had absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film. And there are many such glaring disconnects. In between this mayhem, it was only a pleasure to listen to a few witty lines strewn across that brought that occasional smile. But that is way too little for a film that is just short of 3 hours.Presenting nonsense is an art form. Watching the entire Deol family dance in one frame is not my idea of entertaining nonsense. Other than that, the action sequences and the stylization - the two other reasons why one would consider watching this film - are as lame as they could be. The interesting thing though is that whether you think the film is going to be - hardcore silly entertainment that you love or brainless torture of the senses - your expectations will be fulfilled. ]"
407,"[Whatever you can expect from a film with - an attention grabbing promo; based on a newspaper story that is close to home for one and all of us; directed by the person who made a strong statement with his debut, Aamir; AND aspires to be a commercial success - is delivered.  It's entertaining, it makes its point and it reaches out to us. Then, even if the film simplifies the struggle that the common man has to go through to get his basic right, it feels like it is only so that we keep our hopes strong in this age of a scam a day. Of course, the state of affairs we live in is disturbing beyond measure. So much so that, we applaud something that should be taken for granted - honest bureaucrats, police, and politicians. As the 'aitbaar' song in the film goes - trust is melting away. Thankfully, there are cases like these to restore that faith to however small an extent. And thankfully, there are people in the film industry who can and are willing to make such films to serve as reminders. They also have selected a brilliant team, which brings to screen situations the way that we might have visualized them when we read the newspapers. And more. The story has a good measure of details that are not necessarily known to people who haven't keenly followed the case. The narrative is also kept interesting with the non-linear references to Sabrina's relationship with her sister. The performances only add to what already is an interesting setup. You love the bitch in Mira (Rani Mukherjee) and the cow in Sabrina (Vidya Balan). You get into their story more because of the bit roles played by a reasonably well-staffed supporting cast. The earnest but dumb, junior journalist Aditi (Maanvi Gagroo) is funny because of the situation she is put in. I loved the way Aditi's side-story subtly shows how Mira makes up to her. The submissive, clueless, simple middle class man, Sanjit Lal (Yogendra Tikku) makes you feel the frustration his daughter Sabrina might have gone through. The powerful politician's side-kick is only too proud to ""take care"" of the witnesses and evidence. And the most impressive was the actor who played inspector (name, anyone?). His role in the case is such a huge finger pointed at the country's administration. I could've have done with a little less dramatization, for example entry of the key witness into the courtroom. But, I'd much rather see a commercial success for films like these than cater to my preferences. Isn't it commendable, that a film about such a serious issue leaves you in good humor, without taking away anything from the message. A lot of it has to do with the witty dialogue and amusing (or made amusing) situations. Another huge chunk of credit goes to Amit Trivedi (oh, how I have restrained myself from saying 'the one and only'!) His music in combination with Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics tell you a lot more than the basic story itself. Sure, I would have liked the setup in the first half to have led up to something a little less anti-climactic. Sure, the pace could have been a little better in the first half, which might have made the second half look better. Yet, these seem like mere nitty-gritty when you notice the emotional high that the film has left you with. And especially when you compare it to the huge reminder it is. Of our strength, if only we choose to use it. ]"
408,"[Is anyone else worried about the future of the fairytales we grew up with? How have we come to a place where we have to think twice about taking children to a Snow White film? I'm not opposed to adaptations, but if the only purpose of the adaption is to make a grotesque, violent version of a tested narrative, why choose one that has been used as a bedtime story for children for years? How would you feel if suddenly tomorrow Goofy turned out to be an evil-menacing werewolf-cum-canine who has ferocious animosity against humans? Similarly, while Snow White and The Hunstman is mysteriously dark and has the potential to be a memorable action-fantasy film with stunningly creepy visuals and performances, it seems like making a violent adaption was the primary motive. In which case, I would have preferred the violence and ruggedness be translated into a different plot. The basic story of the film is the same - after killing the king, Snow White's father, Ravenna (Charlize Theron), the evil step-mother imprisons Snow White (Kristen Stewart) in the castle. Vanity is Ravenna's vice, and in pursuit to be the fairest of them all, she is willing to go to any measure. The dwarves aren't characterized as Sleepy, Happy, Bashful etc; nor is Snow White the demure damsel in distress. While this deconstruction seems refreshing on paper, the plot goes in no particular direction. Ultimately, Kristen Stewart's performance is cold and you can't tell the difference between her in Twilight and in this film. Chris Hemsworth also looks like he's dropped out of Thor, into the film. Besides, his role is almost negligible. Charlize Theron is the star performer of the film - positively sinister and she does make you flinch more than once. The rugged quality of the film however, is brought out well. Snow White and The Huntsman serves as an interesting adaptation with potential as compared to Mirror Mirror that was released earlier this year. This is mostly because the mood of the film takes an entire 180 degree turn from the original fairytale. Writer Hossein Amini (of Drive fame) and first time director Rupert Sanders together bring together a gritty texture that does manage to engross you in bits. While the action is more visual effects-heavy and seems a bit forced, the colors and the mood make up for the below-average acting and manage to suck you at particular points during the film.For these reasons particularly, you feel angry that the end result of the film resembles a complacent effort. With a rough makeover of a celebrated fairytale, Snow White and The Huntsman could have been powerful and much more immersive. For now, the film can be lauded for its attempt, but mostly you feel a rising sense of disappointment from the end result. ]"
409,"[Exactly as you'd expect, Rowdy Rathore is a mix of a clever lines delivered in a rowdy style and much melodrama. The action is every bit macho and played out with much gusto. And exactly as you'd expect, Rowdy Rathore hasn't an iota of logic to its paper-thin story. So, yes for the fan of masala and Akshay Kumar, it's a package worth every bit of the ticket money. For others like us, it's exactly as you'd expect - a few laughs at the silliness of it all.Amidst the silliness though, you are introduced to Shiva (Akshay Kumar), a petty crook, who doesn't mind letting the world know he is a thief, and hates children; and has no qualms when he thugs his friend. In fact, you are given an example of each to establish his character. And just when you begin to admire the consistency of his character even though he's the 'supposed' hero of the film, you are asked to lose hope of any major character development. For seemingly no rhyme or reason, he chooses to tolerate a child who he's annoyed with rather than have his way. When the lead character is given such shabby treatment, we didn't really think the female lead would be accorded any respect, did we? Not with a title like Rowdy Rathore. While Shiva's lady love, Priya (Sonakshi Sinha) is thrown in and out of the screenplay, as per convenience, Sonakshi herself does little with what her role offers. She lacks grace in the dance and is equally rowdy. However, in this age of Kareena's and Katrinas, her rubenesque proportions are a welcome change. It's a shame then that it looked like they chose to go for a 'waist double' for close-ups of her supposedly slippery waist. That or she breathed out really hard for those close-ups. There is little damage control she could've done in the couple of scenes she is handed down towards the end.Then you have a few villains who thrive on humiliating people - men, women and children alike; weaker the better. Living in the heart of the country, no law applies to them.Amongst many such cliches is rowdiness  that seeps through the comedy, action, romance and sundry predictable emotional moments. And the film starts with melodrama, which doesn't dip right to the end. This consistency makes Rowdy Rathore an 'entertainer' that requires no laws of story-telling, or good film-making. The attempt at symbolism is hilarious because it is expressed too literally - from raping the police to the references to the mythology of Ram and Krishna, everything is spoon-fed.What I did like though is that amid a lot of the violence, child artists were largely protected from being a part of it or even witness to it. But that there are a couple of scenes where children to witness utmost brutality makes me wonder if it was by design or coincidence. But that's a small reward (if it can even be called that!) for seeing Akshay Kumar as Shiva dressed in pinks, reds, oranges, yellows, lime greens and purples. You can only imagine how loud the background score is to go with these bright colors. But I do get it that that's the central theme - loudness. While Rowdy Rathore is certainly not a film I'd recommend, but it has a carved audience of people who aren't going to wait for any such recommendation. ]"
410,"[Has it ever happened that you overhear a strange conversation, and somehow even though it defies every sense of logic, the words make absolute sense to you? For example, ""We are meant for each other and not meant for each other. It's a contradiction"". I know you understand that line - and Woody Allen knows it too. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is one such film that helps us understand that we are not alone in our chasms of strange thought. As the Woody Allen norm goes, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a character heavy-film. It stands apart from his regular treatment of films, however, because the mood and tone is not portrayed with neurotic dialogues but with scenic surroundings that lend its flavour to the spirit of the film. In this film, Allen has used Barcelona and the Spanish country-side as an additional character, lending its own perspective. The film begins with two friends, Vicky and Cristina, who are on a holiday in Barcelona. They are complete opposites - while Vicky (Rebecca Hall) is disciplined and organized, Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) is more the free-spirit. On a whim, they decide to take upon Juan Antonio's (Javier Bardem, who plays a local painter) offer of joining him on a weekend of self-indulgence (wine, conversation and hours of going-with-the-flow). Through their journey and interactions, we see  their extravagances and their restraints, their discoveries and their ignorance. All come into being through a concoction of mood-setting (lighting and landscape cinematography), performances that depend more on gaze and facial expression than dialogue and that beautiful flamenco background music that gives a sense of freedom. A free-spirit that Allen as the director has allowed the characters to experience through the film.The film picks pace with the entry of Juan Antonio's ex-wife Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz). Maria Elena as a character is a bit of a contradiction - she's easily the most neurotic of the lot, and yet her silence conveys much more than her words. There is a scene in the film, taken from a top angle, which shows her furiously working on a canvas, wearing a torn piece of cloth to cover her. She moves from one stroke to another with absolute silent passion. To me, that scene describes her character best, and makes it apparent that by virtue of mere presence, she's the star of the film.The film's high point is in its interactions; be it a singular character's interactions with the city and its visuals, their interactions with art or photography, or their interactions with one another. Each one lends a different perspective to you as a viewer and Allen knows exactly when to include words/dialogue to seal the scene - like a perfect package that leaves an ever-lasting imprint in your head. The DVD of Vicky Cristina Barcelona doesn't have any extras, but I can tell you that you don't need any. Calling it a sensual film that explores the various possibilities of the visual medium would be an understatement. Vicky Cristina Barcelona is plays out on itself - it's a film that has its own education, where the characters indulge, discover, learn and portray. Surely you'd want to be a part of such an education.]"
411,"[PVR's initiative to release independent films is turning out to be a boon for filmmakers who find it hard to release their films in today's day and age because of 'lack of commercial viability'. Love, Wrinkle-free, directed by debutante Sandeep Mohan, is a film that needed to be released, because it is rare to find a film with such charm and honesty coming out of India today.Set entirely in Goa, the film is essentially the journey of a married couple, Savio and Annie, going through what can best be described as a mid-life crisis. He wants to follow his inner calling - selling his own brand of innerwear. She wants to prove to herself and the world that she's still good enough to be a choir singer, even though the choir would rather have younger singers. And their adopted daughter Ruth has identity issues of her own. She can't come to terms with the fact that she has 'small eyes'. Along the way, they meet a host of mad characters who, for want of a better word, complicate their story just a little bit more.This little charmer of a film is driven by its characters and their journey to come to terms with their self-image. The characters are consistently quirky, and their interactions, though not always 'haha' funny, are laced with such belief and are so grounded in reality, that they always evoke laughter.The film is embellished by earnest performances by the entire lead cast. Ash Chandler, playing Savio, is pitch-perfect as the perpetually hassled middle class man looking to make his family proud of him. Shernaz Patel as Annie - the slightly obsessive-compulsive woman is excellent as well. Sohrab Ardeshir as the local Goan don adds that extra madness to the proceedings. Seema Rahmani, playing a spunky tourist who strikes up a bond with Savio, is a natural. Last seen in Sudhish Kamat's Good Night, Good Morning, she seems to slip into characters that she plays with ease.What truly makes Love, Wrinkle-free's  thoroughly entertaining watch is the indie spirit behind the film. There seems to be no wish to conform, no urge to tell a story with a necessary start and end. The film starts somewhere bang in the middle of the characters lives and ends somewhere in the middle as well. You can't help feel that the story of the characters will continue even after you have walked out of the cinema hall, but the characters and their mad escapades will continue. The core of the film - the underlying theme of identity and image, of one's looks and the concept of youth - will strike a chord with everyone.Setting the film in Goa is another factor that adds to the flavor of the film. The attempt isn't to show Goa the way you would to a tourist. It exists in the background, calm, serene but always there. The earthy colour tone complements the film well. At a time where people get away with tripe saying, 'I don't make films for critics', Love, Wrinkle-free comes as a breath of fresh air. This is the kind of film that is bound to make you smile.]"
412,"[Filmmakers looking to avoid flak for screenplay should usually stay clear of the thriller genre, because it is virtually impossible to have a water-tight screenplay and still make a successfully thrilling mystery that hooks the audience from start to end. While I must confess that I least expected it to, Mohanlal-starrer Grandmaster, produced by UTV, actually manages to avoid some of the pitfalls of a serial-killer-murder-mystery story. Powered by a surprisingly sharp script and a master-class in underplaying a lead character, Grandmaster, directed by Unnikrishnan B, makes for an intriguing watch. Yes, it has its share of flaws in the writing, but the pace of the film rarely lets you dwell on them, diverting attention instead to the mental game of chess that the protagonist is playing, more with himself than with the antagonist.Chandra Sekhar, played by Mohanlal, is a top cop who is past his prime, more because of a personal problem than anything else. He is now heading the newly-formed Metro Crime Stopper Cell, aimed at preventing crime - a department that is underperforming because of Chandra Sekhar's weak leadership. A former National-level chess player, Chandra Sekhar's is jolted out of his mental inertia when the writer of a mysterious letter proclaims that she or he intends to play a deadly game with Chandra Sekhar, one that is intricately tied with Chandra Sekhar's personal life.Thus begins a series of murders, embellished with tantalizing clues and mysterious taunts. With each murder, Chandra Sekhar is sucked in further, as he matches his wits with a faceless opponent in what could be the most important game of chess in his life - one where a checkmate could be fatal. What works the most for Grandmaster is the character of Chandra Sekhar. A man who was once the toast of the police department, now broken and lonely, spurred into action because of a maniacal serial killer. Add to that, a man named Mohanlal. There aren't many actors who use their eyes the way Mohanlal does. Perhaps not blessed with as much natural screen presence as some of his superstar contemporaries, his eyes separate his craft from the rest of the pack. They rove about the screen slowly, partaking in the journey towards the resolution that a cinematic character must invariably be rewarded (or punished) with. Mohanlal plays Chandra Sekhar so subtly and competently that it would be easy to mistake this performance as just one amongst the hundreds that he has given. But look closer and you see just why he is considered one of the finest actors in the country, and why he is my personal favourite Indian actor by some distance. He slips into the character, walking, talking, thinking and fighting the way a wounded tiger forced to protect his domain would.As mentioned earlier, the film has its share of flaws, primarily in the writing and then in the performances. There are plot holes that could have been avoided, and some situations in the screenplay are a tad farfetched. Also, while the beautiful Priyamani, playing Mohanlal's ex-wife, is a competent actor, some important side characters are quite weak, crossing over to plain overacting - a huge problem that is compounded because of how subtly Mohanlal has played his character.It then boils down to just the simple fact that Grandmaster has you on the idiomatic edge of your seat throughout. The film is paced just right, the twists in the screenplay don't really jar, and the climactic revelation really worked for me, though I must confess I'm not sure how many people would agree with me on that. Nonetheless, for those who like being hooked to a thriller, Grandmaster makes for a decent watch. And to truly savour it, pay special attention to Mohanlal's eyes.]"
413,"[The only novelty in Yeh Khula Aasmaan is the grandfather-grandson relationship. The rest is a mix of inspiring 'quotable quotes' that are worth what they are worth and the typical underdog sports story. Behind all the emphasis on not pressurizing a child to score academically is a thick layer of pressure to succeed in whatever it is chosen for him. And that didn't at all work for me. However, if there is one take away from Yeh Khula Aasman it is the brilliant performance of Raghuvir Yadav.Whether or not I agree with what Raghuvir Yadav's character had to do, his performance is warm and endearing. So is debutant Raj Tondon's performance - he comes across as the perfect representative of the confused, diffident, complex age called adolescence. The rest of the cast is actually functional and thus caricaturish. Only these two seem to have real emotions. In that sense then, real emotion is what the relationship is about. That I found it far from ideal is a different matter. While Ye Khula Aasmaan looks down upon parents tendency to put their children down as a way to bring a sense of responsibility, it adds the burden of bearing a grandparent's aspirations. This then boils down to a child having to live up to someone or the others' expectations. What good will that do? So, what if a simple medium of a kite-fight is used signify this larger thing called life. The metaphor is used beautifully in one song, but beyond that it becomes a bit much and all I could see was the need for Avinash (Raj Tondon) to succeed. This brings me to the question, what happens to people who don't succeed? There are people who haven't ever succeeded in anything they did. What happens to them? Or it just might be that there is no story worth making a film out of in there. There are indeed very few 'loser' protagonists who have succeeded as a story in a film. I won't say which route Yeh Khula Aasmaan takes, that one you'll figure out as the movie progresses. But, what I can tell you is that Yeh Khula Aasmaan is not a complete loss because of Raghuvir Yadav, Raj Tondon and the chemistry they create. The preachy dialogue worked just a bit because it was within a relationship between a grandfather and his grandson. You could see it fall apart as soon as Avinash's friends began saying lines meant to inspire. Yeh Khula Aasman has some lovely, warm, genuine moments of camaraderie between  grandparent and grandchild both because of hard work at writing and an heartfelt performances by the protagonists. Unfortunately, it beats its purpose by doing exactly what it pointed a figure at to start with. ]"
414,"[In a film, if there is anything that grates more than the fact that the lead actor can't act to save his or her life, it is over-the-top, shameless in-film branding. Jai Jai Maharashtra Maza, directed by Gautam Joglekar, unfortunately has both these problems. So, despite a story that had reasonable potential, Jai Jai Maharashtra Maza is little more than a waste of one's time. What you'll walk away with after this film are Fair &amp; Lovely, Amanora, Sanjay Ghodawat Group, Volkswagen, Shamrao Vitthal Bank and then some. Ashwini Stevenson (played by Anusha Dandekar) is the world's number one female tennis player. Adopted from an orphanage in Pune when she was still an infant, she was brought up by her American adoptive mother, Gail Stevenson. Meanwhile, Dilip &amp; Amruta Rege are a happily married couple who are still romantic at heart even after 25 years of marriage. Their paths collide when it comes forth that Ashwini's and Amruta's pasts are intricately linked.Mahesh Manjrekar and Mrunal Kulkarni, who play the Reges, are easily the best things about the film. Manjrekar's character, in particular, will be universally appreciated because of the way it is written and the calm manner in which Manjrekar essays the part. Also lending a decent supporting hand are Siddharth Chandekar (who plays their son) and Hemant Dhome, who plays a charming bumpkin from Kolhapur. But no amount of decent acting from the others can take away from the lack or excess of it on the part of Anusha Dandekar. On the surface, she seems perfect for the part of a Marathi girl brought up as an American. But her character seems like it was developed out of screenwriting sessions held purely by five-year olds. Add to that the fact that Anusha's dialogue delivery is extremely weak, be it in English or Marathi. The result is that watching her on screen in this film is a cumbersome task, one that you just cannot wait to get over with. Embarrassing guest appearances by Aditi Govitrikar and Karishma Shah do nothing to help the film's cause.Attempting to shoot the film in vibrant colours, the makers of the film succeed in making the film look fresh. However, like so many films in the past, it is easy to tell which shots were shot with a DSLR. Also, there are often times when it looks like the cinematographer is trying too hard, particularly during some close up shots of faces.The inconsistent writing is another serious flaw in the film. The romantic track between Anusha Dandekar and Hemant Dhome is highly implausible and is poorly developed. There is also a moralistic sidetrack about the ills of sensationalist journalism today, which seems almost incongruent with the manner in which brands are plugged throughout the film. Which brings me back to that which will trouble the audience the most. How is one supposed to take a song tribute to Pune seriously, when the name and number of a cab agency is thrust in front of your face every few minutes? How do you identify with a character when you have the Fair &amp; Lovely signature tune playing whenever she pauses to catch a breath? How is the audience supposed to get involved with the characters, when they pause to extoll the virtues of a group that is involved in construction, which also happens to be the producer of film? Cinema is a powerful medium, one that was always going to fall prey to excessive commercial misuse. But Jai Jai Maharashtra Maza takes it to dizzying new levels of shamelessness. For that reason alone, the makers of the film need to learn a lesson in not taking the audience for granted. Jai Jai Maharashtra is watchable, but avoiding it will do no one any harm at all.]"
415,"[In 1941, Sussex, England, celebrated feminist author Virginia Woolf puts rocks in her pockets and drowns herself in a river. Of the many floating speculations, the largely accepted reason for this suicide was Woolf's much talked about paranoia. Her style and her works have been widely adapted and made into theatrical plays and feature films - yet, only one such film manages to capture the exact concoction of feminism, fiction and bizarre eccentricity that was Virginia Woolf - The Hours. The movie, based on the novel of the same name by Michael Cunningham, is based on three women who are connected by the segregated souls of a character from Woolf's novel Mrs. Dalloway - Clarissa Dalloway. The film is also divided into three time zones. In 2002, there is Clarissa Vaughan (played by Meryl Streep), a New Yorker who prepares a party for her AIDS-stricken friend Richard (Ed Harris). In 1950s Los Angeles there is Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) who is pregnant and vastly dissatisfied in her marriage. Then there is Woolf herself (played by Nichole Kidman), in the 1920s in England, and we see her struggling with her depression and mental paranoia.All three characters are connected - like three lost souls swimming in a fish bowl. They are different aspects of the one character in Woolf's novel. Clarissa Dalloway is an over-analytical, submissive, bi-curious, complex woman and these aspects have been stripped into three vital characters. Moore, Streep and Kidman adapt to their cultural and social time zones perfectly and yet stay true to their complexity, because The Hours is a complex film. It's a film that delves deep into the psyche of these these characters and their battle with their complicated selves. Parallel narratives guide the film, while we get a strong whiff of every character's thought processes and questions. It's a technique that Woolf was famous for - stream of consciousness - the ability to write freely as the character thinks. Director Stephen Daldry adapts this technique well, as you feel you are visually entering the minds of these three women, carefully observing their every thought and every dilapidated query. The Hours is essentially a celebration of complexity of thought. You may not be going in any direction, plot-wise, with the film. You will just find yourself walking around in circles, dissecting every thought-bubble that the film tries to present to you. The most important thing that The Hours does is make you question. The kind of spooky questioning that lets you lie in bed, stare at the ceiling and just think - What is acceptable behavior and what is not? The existential question that rides all our backs - what is life about? What am I doing with mine? More than that, the film offers you three different approaches to sexuality, suicide, depression and three different versions of the same women who have those approaches.The DVD of The Hours has some interesting features: An audio commentary by Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman and 4 Featurettes: Three Women, The Mind and Times of Virginia Woolf, The Music of The Hours, The Lives of Mrs. Dalloway. All four featurrettes are small and explanatory. It provides as a great post-movie viewing as it puts a lot of things into perspective if you haven't read Mrs Dalloway or The Hours.What makes The Hours a must watch, over the novel, are the performances. Kidman is absolutely engrossing, as Virgina Woolf (you might not even recognize her with her nose being drastically tampered with), playing the desolate, complex part. I would go ahead and say she is the best performer in the film, even ahead of Streep, who looks like she got up from her sleep to play this part. Streepis effortless and extremely likeable - a concrete emotion that Clarissa Dalloway doesn't draw. Julianne Moore looks her demure and confused part. Watch The Hours most certainly not for entertainment, but for the deep and difficult questioning of those very human emotions we take for granted. ]"
416,"[Have you ever left the cinema hall with the word ""wow"" written all over your face while your eyes are weeping your heart out? This is the kind of cinema that highlights the balance needed in making a movie out of a social issue. The balance needed between the thought provoking subject itself and the actual art of film-making. The acting, the characterizations, the relationships, the drama all have to contribute to the story, or else the audience's attention is diverted from the topic at hand and the very purpose of making the movie is lost. The movie is real but not boring. The fact that most acts of terrorism occur right in the middle of a normal day has been highlighted beautifully. The audience can feel the tension but not the characters who are going through their daily routine. However, this movie is not as much about the riots as it is about the aftermath. This reality has been brought about with a minimum amount of drama. A little cinematic liberty, which seems out of place, is taken towards the climax. But hey, you are watching a movie after all.It manages to tell the story to that section of the audience which did not know about the degree of the violence, without grossing them out. And yet shocks even those who could visualize the atrocities from what they read and saw in the media (in 2002). The movie very obviously is from the Muslim point of view, but then again, they were the ones who were victimized the most.  The acting leaves you spell-bound. Sarika's immense talent has been underrated all these years. Because of which it is very easy to take Naseeruddin Shah's usual yet exceptional performance for granted. Corin Nemec puts up a good show too. However, what exact purpose his cynical character serves is unclear. It could have been to show the impact internal riots had on a neutral person. Or it could be to point out sarcastically how Indians are nice to people because they are 'white' but a few days later they are cutting throats of their own nationality. Or it could be a way to find distributors at least somewhere in the world. That could also be the reason behind keeping the base language English. The only other things that did not work were that it got a little preachy at one point and the hints to Gandhism were not fully fleshed out. You should try and make a trip to the theaters for this one, because it is certainly not going to have the same impact on a small screen. While you see and hear of a village being transformed into a slaughterhouse, you will try to absorb the fact that this happened in reality. Also, you will realize that this is the story of just one family. How many more were affected by these riots? How many more are effected by all the terrorism around the world year after year?]"
417,"[Chintoo feels like a film that was made by a team that really wanted to make a film for kids and show adults a child's point of view. Therein lies the contradiction. If it is a film for kids then why bother showing their point of view to adults? If the point is to show a child's perspective to adults, then the movie needed to be made for adults and not for kids only. Chintoo doesn't have enough material or rather is too childish to be considered a film for adults. Yet, it does work for kids because it does capture their way of looking at things around them and their imagination. Though it is not a must watch even for kids, it's not like kids have too much choice this summer. Chintoo is full of moments that are both worthy of spending time on and are executed well. But, they do not come together as one complete story. The build-up of the team called the 'waanar vede warriors', their acknowledgement for the need for fitness, the struggle of putting together their stadium, their aspirations, their struggle with an opposing bunch of children, and finally their battle against an adult who can't see their way - are among the many things that Chintoo wants to talk about. In the middle of all this you see various interconnections - parents struggle with today's age of couch-gaming, parents-as-a-unit and their relationship with a child, a mother-son tie, bonding between a grandparent and their child. Unfortunately, all these different things stay different and don't link with each other to form one smooth-flowing story. What makes Chintoo worthwhile (at least for kids) is that each of these sections is treated with a lot of love and care. For its little bit each section engages you and you look forward to what it is going to end up with. That it doesn't end up in anything substantial, meaningful or interesting is a different thing all together. In that sense, Chintoo might have aimed at the attention span of 10-year olds. As an adult, what started off for me as a perfect look into familial interactions between parents and children ended up as an overdose of the same whining that I had left behind at home for some peace and quiet in the theater. Yet, let me not speak on behalf of those for whom the Chintoo comics are reason for nostalgia. I didn't grow up with them and wouldn't know what that means to someone who has. On the other hand, I'd assume the film is directed equally towards people who hadn't read the comics. So, as a part of that audience I know that I have too many problems with how Chintoo panned out. From what has already been said to the innumerable questions that the climax with the many inconsistencies in writing throughout, Chintoo is far from a 'must watch' experience. Sure, the kids acted well but there was nothing exceptional about the performances. The adults all looked and sounded like caricatures except for Vibhavari Deshpande. But she does have too much make-up on which is extremely distracting. That and Subodh Bhave's wig/hair-do. So distracting that I choose to mention it before mentioning the apt amount of cuteness that the child artists have. Just the typical right amount that is. Just for the lack of choice that kids have this summer, Chintoo might be a film worth a watch for kids. For adults, we can survive with another week out of the theaters, can't we?]"
418,"[You see a politician frustrated with the system so corrupt that it doesn't allow justice the way it should be. You see him find a solution. You see him set up a department to blatantly kill everyone they know to be guilty, without any heed to legality. You see the potential this story has to handle something so controversial. You hold off on a smirk when you see that this department will be called....""Department""! Except that you see all of this in the weirdest angles and camera positions imaginable. You want to call it imaginative and ambivalently end up wishing that no one had imagined it at all. Because the histrionics of the camera rob you of anything half-decent that the film potentially had.It hurts to discredit someone for trying to be creative. But the fact remains that, that spurt of ingenuity didn't work one bit. And believe me, experience has taught me to brace myself, as I would in a roller coaster ride, when entering a RGV film - even the ones produced by him, let alone directed by the man himself. I'd have felt less annoyed if the non-standard camera work had a directorial purpose in terms of characters or situations that it's used for. But nothing of that sort happens. The coolness fact ends with, ""I wonder where the camera is as this striker is moving about the carrom board or as this tea-pan is being taken to the cup for the tea to be strained."" If there was something symbolic that I missed, it was not for want of trying. Department is full of quirky characters and performances. And some of the characters are interesting too, mainly because they do carry a few shades of gray despite being in the business of killing people. But none of the grayness is taken further, you are just tempted into the den with it and left there in the darkness of a regular underworld story. The now boring nexus of business and crime called politics, crime and business of politics, and the politics and business in crime - now that's a RGV tweet in the making! That's what some of the dialogue in the film sounds like too - right out of the director's twitter timeline. Yet, there are moments, especially with Amitabh Bachchan on screen where you feel like respite is coming your way. His character's (Sarjerao) enigma is charming right through the end. So much so that if that is what it is going to be about, I don't mind a Department 2,even if I'm bound to be disappointed. Sarjerao's quirkiness makes you laugh out loud. I actually waited with bated breath when it felt like he was going to advocate drinking alcohol, much in the 'daaru peene se liver kharaab...' vein. But alas, nothing of that epic sort happens, or even mini epics. Instead, you are left wondering what was the point of that scene. And many, many more such scenes come and go that are disconnected with the film by itself. The rest is a criss-cross of crossers, double-crossers. Again the regular sort, nothing that you haven't seen earlier in a gangwar film. There is one issue I've always had with use of child actors in violent films. Department has many violent chase sequences where children shown in passing. Not a child is bothered by the shooting going on, they continue to play on ball. Even if the intent is to show how we are desensitizing our children to violence, I can't help but shudder every time I see an actual child in a scene like that - made to act indifferent to the violence around him/her. Irrespective of that, Department had the chance to make us see both sides of any solution that we choose for our degenerating systems. But, the makers chose to focus on camera gimmickry rather than build on the premise it chose. The stuff that you see in any underworld film are done to death, the new stuff makes you wish they hadn't tried and the things in between, they didn't explore to its fullest. ]"
419,"[What you expect from What to Expect When You're Expecting doesn't falter one bit through the 110 minutes of the film. The film is adapted by the non-fiction book of the same name and its main draw, much like other ensemble films like He's Just Not that Into You and New Year's Eve is the variety of familiar faces, (gorgeous Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez playing pregnant woman who look cosmetically flawless) virtually no character-viewer relationship, some funny moments and a predictable story-line. Based in New York, the film graphs seven couples who have one thing in common - they're all having a baby. Soon they realize that pregnancy is harder than they imagined. The many characters include Cameron Diaz, a fitness guru celebrity who winds up with an unexpected pregnancy. While Jennifer Lopez finds trouble adopting a child after having difficulty in conceiving, Elizabeth Banks preaches on a perfect pregnancy but all her rules go topsy-turvy when she's expecting, and Chace Crawford (Gossip girl fame) and Anna Kendrick (of the Twilight saga) play ex-lovers who reunite to result in an accidental pregnancy. The movie does have its funny moments though - mostly to Elizabeth Bank's credit, where she plays the uptight mommy-to-be who becomes a chaotic mess by the d-day. Her trail is the funniest to follow, and you find yourself waiting for her bit to pop up amidst the ensemble. On the flipside, most of the humor adopted for the bigger stars like Diaz and Lopez seem repetitive and remind you of an American sitcom.The film, predictably so, relies on many cliches - the beautiful first touch of a new-born baby, the surge of emotions that a mommy-to-be faces and the parallel track of the husbands, which I would have preferred to be more inclusive. As it is, the husbands are quite negligible, and much to our disappointment most of the couple are pretty straightforward. No gay couple or even inter-racial couples for that matter. A cultural or homosexual complexity while having a child could have provided fodder for further humor. The film unfolds mostly through predictable background score and you can virtually check off every cliche being used in the film: every trouble is eventually justified with the larger joy of being a mother, the character who has the most trouble ends up with the happiest ending and the actual act of conceiving is as glamorous and colorful as the posters of the film. Being the biggest stars in the film, Lopez and Diaz mostly disappoint with the plastic performances.If what you're looking for is a happy-fun film with many faces and characters I suggest you rent Love Actually. What to Expect When You're Expecting is a disappointment. ]"
420,"[""Well, let's just say I like to live dangerously."" - Tommy PlymptonAs the end credits of 22 Female Kottayam roll, the first credit that appears reads 'Filmography', and it lists three films that '22 Female' is inspired from. While two of those three films would make it to my all-time favourite lists, even those to whom the films are not as special would see the similarities that these films share. Naming those films, of course, would be a thorough disservice to those who are yet to watch 22 Female Kottayam.Tessa K. Abraham is a Malayali nurse living and working in Bangalore, who is looking to settle in Canada. In the quest for her visa, she meets Cyril, a man who runs a visa agency. With his school-boyish charm and earnestness, Cyril wins Tessa over and love blossoms. But stories never end when the boy and girl fall in love, do they?While 22 Female Kottayam is a thriller, which has been appreciated because it is at its core an engaging fiction story, why it really needs to be lauded is because of its treatment. Director Aashiq Abu, in the course of narrating the tale, shows rare insight into the life of a young, city-bred woman living in a cosmopolis in India. Women check out a man's posterior, they don't fear revealing that they aren't virgins before getting into a relationship, and some young women get into relationships of convenience with older, married men. All these, and more, are truths with no notions of morality affecting them, and a majority of India is yet to come to terms with it even in real life. Cinema, then, is still some distance away. But Aashiq Abu and his writers weave their story around these facets of life, and therein lies the truth behind why 22 Female Kottayam is being hailed as a path-breaking film.The film however, is far from perfect. Both halves of the film are starkly different from each other, and though one can see that the makers have tried to let each side of the story build slowly, the fact remains that the film tends to sag. There are long stretches which are devoted to establishing and then re-establishing what has been established, rather than carrying the story forward. And this repeats throughout the film. Had the film been pruned by 20 minutes or so, it could have possibly been more impactful.Rima Kallingal, who plays Tessa, has a mysterious presence that is always smouldering just below the surface. She looks convincing throughout, even though she isn't naturally blessed with the acting mettle to pull off the complex character that she portrays. She manages to hold the film up, for which she needs to be lauded. However, I couldn't help wonder if the film would have turned out better if a more competent actress had played the part. Fahad Fazil as Cyril is excellent. He isn't a typical Malayalam film hero and he'll never be able to pull off the grand entrances that some Malayalam superstars make. Instead, he is like a counter-balance to them. Fahad Fazil could possibly be the poster boy for the new paths that commercial Malayalam cinema seems to be treading. Prathap Pothen, in a rather pivotal role as a father figure to Cyril makes a mark.Where 22 Female Kottayam lacks the most is the music. A story like this would have been served well if it had that one hooking piece of music, that one melody which haunts the viewer even hours after he has left the cinema hall, which helps him relive the tale he experienced. 22 Female Kottayam is a film that can be appreciated better with its second viewing in the theatre, but it will possibly miss out on its repeat audiences because of the lack of enduring music. Still, with its twisted, engaging story and effortlessly slick cinematography, the film is bound to draw the claps that I heard once the end credits roll.]"
421,"[Youth is celebrated in the Hindi film industry - where else would you find 40-year-old actors, play college-going students? It's an industry where a female actor is gracefully expected to retire from being a heroine at the age of 35, tops. In contrast to this, what strikes most about The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is that the movie involves the unfolding on the lives of seven elderly British people and their journey to India. For its abashed take on human experience, regardless of age, The Best Exotic Marigold is a delightful watch.The film begins with an introduction of characters, and spends not more than a fast-paced minute or two to wittily describe their current lives. It's a concoction of a cast that you assume (correctly so), cannot go wrong. The ensemble includes Judy Dench as a newly widowed housewife, Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilkin, a married couple of 40 years, Maggie Smith as an uptight ex-housekeeper, Tom Wilkinson as an ex-court Judge, Ronald Pickup (true to his name) as wannabe Casanova longing for companionship and Celia Imrie as a hopeful husband hunter. They all find themselves on a flight to Jaipur to a hotel/retreat for the ""Elderly and the Beautiful"" - where they meet an effervescent Sonny (Dev Patel), the manager of the hotel who tries to sell the dusty, out of order place as an upcoming palace. Evidently, their hopes and dreams of an exciting old-age experience is on the brink of shattering. We see the film take a route of discovery; an interesting mix of self-discovery and a sense of wonder and amazement towards this culture shock. Director, John Madden is able to place the personal stories and the wide array of public experiences with a captivating sense of visual beauty. Within the first half of the film, you get absorbed into the lives of these characters; even Patel's life as the manager of the hotel; he has his own baggage. You find yourself hoping the Hotel will have a makeover soon, and that it looks as beautiful as Patel's Shakespearean mumbling to potential financers. Soon, you find yourself falling in love with the surroundings, even though the choice to portray an ever-Indian aspect in the film is largely cliched (with stress on the heat, stench, over-population, and our obsessive curiosity towards foreigners), you find that an effort has been made. The background score through the film is overwhelming, with its soothing classical Hindustani tones. Most of all, it's a relief to see the Indians in the film talk in Hindi and not with an accented English. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is not a fast-paced film with too much to absorb - it allows you to slowly take in every experience that the characters are experiencing, and every visual that over-powers them. The Indian cliches are calming, and remind you of surrounding that you are used to. Sometimes, the film does ponder over a situation for far too long, trying to bring out the abstract beauty of the scene, but for the most part, the performances, profound dialogue and comical/wondrous perspective of India make the film a worth-while watch. ]"
422,"[Love can be fatal and thus ishhq, dangerous. So dangerous that it cannot be found nor avenged over 500 years and five reincarnations. As ridiculous as it sounds, I do think there could have been a poetic charm about love over many lives, but the way Dangerous Ishhq is done, it comes across more as a field day for the costume and jewelry designers of the film. The setting with common people having super-human powers in real life didn't quite get with the current day story. Yes, we accept it in our Harry Potters and we accepted weapons that spit light and made sounds in our Ramayans and Mahabharats because the entire setting is such, that of fantasy. Here, we are given the mandatory alternate medicine therapist, a doctor who begins to believe and a cop who doesn't trust - as is seen in most Bhatt films that touch upon the supernatural theme - which just doesn't work. You cannot ask me to 'just believe', you have to make me believe - which just about never happens in reincarnation films - be it one reincarnation or five. Add to that a 'comeback' by an actor from the 90s. The consolation is Karishma Kapoor makes nostalgic by being her same old shrill self who alternates her shrieks with playing a painted, plastic doll. The rest of the cast don't do much to engage you either. That would have been a complaint worth elaborating on had there been a plot that involved you with the character's stories. All you can do is laugh at every time Sanjana (Karisma Kapoor) hallucinated about one of her past lives. Ultimately, it ends up being a show case for Karishma Kapoor in different types of costumes and jewelry. Other than that, I didn't see any other reason for making a film based on this theme. ]"
423,"[Love stories with characters belonging to rival families have something intrinsically tragic about them. Sometimes the pathos is overwhelming enough to make you ignore everything else that's wrong with the story. At other times though, it could be an Ishaqzaade which isn't sure about how it wants the audience to react to its characters and thus comes across as confused. Add to that a stretched out, predictable  climax and you have an uneasy, restless audience.The first scene introduces Parmar (Arjun Kapoor) as a ruthless, uncouth brat who the audience will very unwillingly call an anti-hero, let alone hero. And no, right to the end, you cannot warm up to his character; empathizing or rooting for his cause is a distant thought. But that also says two things complimentary about the content - Parmar does nothing out of character and is consistent; Arjun Kapoor plays Parmar to perfection because the feeling of disgust towards the character never leaves you. Exactly the same things can be said about Zoya and Parineeti Chopra the actor who plays Zoya. Zoya is consistently immature and ironically feminine as far as emotion goes, behind all the macho bravado.  In fact, Zoya is likable despite this inconsistency because life is a thrill ride for her and death is equally adventurous too. This charm seeps through and that has a lot to do with Parineeti Chopra's refreshing attitude towards being a lead lady in a Hindi film. Unfortunate as it is, none of this translates into a story that can sustain your interest for over two hours. Ishaqzaade reminded me that ""predicable"" doesn't just mean the audience guessing exactly what will happen. A story is predicable and a tad more frustratingly so, when the audience guesses two (or more) possible outcomes of a particular situation and both (or all) seem equally done to death. You could do all of this in style have good camera work and sense of aesthetics but the lack of content is transparent. The dialogues lack the charm of Habib Faisal's debut Do Dooni Chaar. The references - to a woman's place in Indian society, be it a strong-headed girl or a righteous widow, and similar impotence of a man who does whatever it takes because he seeks approval of his role model - are very interesting but do little to how lame the plot is as it culminates. Social message at the end, notwithstanding.A love story is a love story is a love story. And actually, we expect very little from it, in terms of being different. What we want is to engage with our Romeos  and Juliets, we want to feel that a Majnu should unite with his Laila, in this world or beyond. But in Ishaqzaade, you aren't even sure Ranjha deserves Heer. Amidst the endless gun shots, you are hoping for a gun or two to go with the cliche and run out of bullets, so there is some sight of 'The End'.]"
424,"[Another Tim Burton film starring Johnny Depp - totally did not see that coming! After 7 films together, their films now, are more a celebration of their eccentric partnership than anything else. Dark Shadows is a primary example of this fact. Obviously, Depp plays his part with absolute charm, (he's like the male Meryl Streep, incapable of doing anything bad, but I digress.) Dark Shadows however, is like a well-dressed girl who has nowhere to go. It's a grand production, with an elaborate set design and costumes, but lacks substance.Based on the popular American soap opera from the early 70s, Dark Shadows surrounds vampire Barnabass Collins (Depp) who is resurrected from his coffin at 1972 after 200 years. He finds that the glorious empire is ruined, and his fisheries business is falling. To top it all, the ruthless witch who turned him into a vampire, Angelique (Eva Green) is now ruling their coastal town. The film tracks how he saves his hometown, by teaming up with the Collins' family matriarch (Michelle Pfieffer).The basic premise of the film has scope - here is a vampire from 200 years ago who still believes the world starts and ends with him. He's dated, and the humor stems from that fact that he doesn't fit. Dark Shadows does have its moments, mainly because we all know Johnny Depp has his way with wit. You will find yourself laughing, but it's also a token humor that you know is forceful. You realize that you keep expecting the film to get funnier - but it doesn't.The performances do manage to give you 140 minutes of entertainment, if you ignore the follies. Eva Green as the drop-dead gorgeous Angelique is the show stopper of the film. She's sharp, funny (yes the funniest part of the film for sure) and stunning. Like most Tim Burton films, the setting and mood is applaud-able. Sets, costumes and dialogues all transport you to an eccentric alternate world that governs most Burton films. You also find that the soundtrack is dominating by rock classics of the 70s. Ofcourse, the central factor here is that Dark Shadows is all about Johnny Depp - his extravagant hairdos and frills, his experiments and his charm parade where he tries to knock you off with his humor. Usually, it's the arrogance that works, but in this case it does seem laborious because it doesn't have a story to fall back on. If you're a fan of the Burton-Depp franchise, you might either be extremely disappointed having expected to be blown away or you might just settle for a complacent effort on their part. Dark Shadows could have been a humorous, engaging film as it's made with all the right decisions in casting and setting. As it is though, the film falls short of its expectations - like a half-baked attempt that you might enjoy only if you worship Johnny Depp. ]"
425,"[No matter how much you claim to love the movies, there will always be one man who can rightfully claim to love them more. His name is Martin Scorsese. That Scorsese's knowledge and understanding of film history, film theory and film grammar is virtually unmatched is a fact well known. So if there was anyone who one could bet on, to understand exactly when and how to use the oft-abused 3D technology to get the best out of it, it would have to be Martin Scorsese. So what does Scorsese do when he uses 3D for the first time ever? He makes a thrillingly visual ode to that which he loves the most - the movies. Hugo is a film that you shouldn't miss in the theatre even if you don't like cinema. And if you love the movies the way some of us do, Hugo is an experience that won't exit your system in a hurry. Based on the book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' by Brian Selznick, Hugo tells the tale of an orphan who lives within the recesses of a Paris train station - his home amidst the chains and sprockets that run the clock at the train station provides him with an enviable view of the Eiffel Tower looming large over one of the world's great cities. One of Hugo's most prized possessions is a mechanical humanoid, something his deceased father found years ago in a forgotten corner of a museum. And Hugo's aim is to complete his father's dream of making the mechanical bot work once again. In his quest, he encounters a shopkeeper at the train station, a man whose story is inexorably tied with Hugo's. Shot lovingly in glorious 3D, Hugo is arguably the first film that beautifully meshes the third dimension with the grammar of cinema to create a compelling theatrical experience. Not to mention the fact that proponents of digital over film will be thrilled with the results that the Arri Alexa has produced. Even the Academy Award for Cinematography doesn't do justice to just how good Hugo is visually - the breathtaking opening shot alone justifies the use of 3D. The atmosphere that the film creates with the post-World War I Parisian setting is nothing short of incredible. The fact that a large portion of it is multiple Award-winning VFX rarely crosses your mind. Interestingly, not too deep from the surface of the thrill-ride that the story and the characters take you on, lies the characters' quest for answers to the ultimate existential dilemma - what is one's purpose? What helps immensely is the fact that the entire cast does complete justice to their parts. With his piercing blue eyes, Asa Butterfield as Hugo will charm you. But it is Ben Kingsley playing the old 'shopkeeper' whose performance will leave you with a lump in your throat. Also, Sacha Baron Cohen as the over-enthusiastic Station Master out for Hugo's throat is plain adorable. But nothing beats the ultimate treat that this film offers - its tribute to cinema. Hugo is the kind of film that will show you just how much you love the movies - the intensity of the shivers up your spine will be directly proportional to how much cinema means to you. This, the most un-Scorsese like picture ever, actually feels much closer to Scorsese's heart than most of his other jaw-dropping work.The tragedy then is that Hugo has been released in India over four months since it was released abroad. And this afterthought release itself is nothing short of embarrassing - no multiplex has more than a show a day for 'A Martin Scorsese Picture.' One can only hope that the audience throngs these limited shows to show corporates how to treat a master's work.]"
426,"[In absolute terms Jumbo, the baby elephant will keep kids good company. But relatively speaking it doesn't have the zing of The Lion King or the wit and sensitivity of Finding Nemo, two movies the plot seems to have tried to combine.On the look for his missing father, Jumbo loses his way and is torn apart from his mother too. What more can a child identify with? Separation from parents - the biggest fear and the most traumatic nightmare imaginable. Going ahead too, the plot is not treated with kid gloves. It stays pretty close to dark. That makes it a kids' movie that respects the target audience's intelligence even if the subtlety is not noticed by them.And yet they need the fun and energy, which I think is missing. That kids might not miss it at all, is a completely different matter. The story doesn't have anything new, but then kids love repetition. And hey, it is, in fact better than the alternatives produced in recent times. So, it all depends on what you are comparing it too. There are enough on either side of the scale and Jumbo stands pretty much in the middle. Same goes for the animation, it wasn't entirely appealing. Elephants with long legs, wide eyes, and out of proportion trunks were not pleasing to watch, even if it was only for 90 minutes. Same goes for other animals sketched out. I liked the concept of elephants in multiple colors though. A comment on how the species stays united despite the variation in skin color?In my mind voices of characters are done well, if I have to try hard to recognize the voice - it seems familiar but I cant spot it because of the modulation. So, when a Gulshan Grover does a Gulshan Grover and Rajpal Yadav and Asrani too play themselves, I find it mundane if not annoying. On the other hand despite the tremendous publicity Akshay Kumar and Dimple Kapadia got, they sounded like supposedly-cute elephants would if they could speak. Their inflections sounded convincing.On the Hindi animation scene for kids, there isn't much happening - especially non-mythological. In that sense, it is good to have Jumbo dubbed with the right amount of star value. But otherwise, there isn't anything remarkably different about the story or the animation.]"
427,"[Jason Statham's name appears on the screen and you immediately know what you can expect from the film. Former star of films like Lock, Stock and Two smoking Barrels, Snatch and the Transporter series, Statham has stayed true to the action genre - never really deviating from his comfort zone. Safe however, is an action overdose. It's a case of dumbing down of the basic story, too many unnecessary stylistic elements, a large celebration of Statham and nothing more. In Safe, Statham plays ex-cop Luke Wright who worked for the NYPD and exclusively with the mayor (Chris Sarandon). Fed up with the rising corruption, he decides to quit and get involved in the city's underground rigged fights culture. You are shown that it gives him a vent for his frustration, over visuals of repeated action, minute after minute.The conflict arises when the Russian Mafia gets involved and kills his entire family over a dispute. He decides to seek revenge when he witnesses the same men torturing an 11-year old Chinese girl, Mei. The film is as much about their growing relationship, as Statham plays her protector.However, Safe doesn't hold for long enough to establish any emotional connection. We are told nothing about Statham's wife, and so through the film we have no motive to empathize with any conversation. The action, as a result, isn't soaked in cold-blooded revenge either, and therefore it makes for a stale viewing.Mei's character is written well, and fortunately also has a graph. We learn that apart from her helpless situation, she is also a whiz kid who learns faster than she speaks. The pace of the film becomes a problem; mostly because director Boaz Yakin has decided to depend on fast cuts to establish most of the film. You aren't given enough time to grasp anything - and before you know it, someone is beating up another person.The first few minutes of Safe seemed interesting. The visual texture of the film was gritty and I was expecting a nail-bitter. Statham takes no time to overpower every other aspect in the film (he also looks uncannily like Bruce Willis, so his bar is pretty high) and you are left, wanting to see other parts of the film. A back-story of Statham's relationship with his wife or maybe the terror and hold of the Russian Mafia in the New York crime underbelly could have been a lot more insightful for us to base the film upon. The number of could-haves brings down your viewing experience of Safe. Watch it only if you're a die-hard fan of Jason Statham. ]"
428,"[What is it that makes Vishesh Films name its films to make them sound like sequels? Murder 2 earlier and now Jannat 2 have nothing to do with the films with the same names but for the number attached at the end. Is it that the producers are trying to bank on the success of the earlier films to get in the initial crowd? Is it lack of creativity? Is it pure laziness? Or is it mere disinterest? The same disinterest that shows through the film by the actors and the director.Of the entire team, only the writer seems to show interest right through the end of his assignment. Sonu Dilli (Emraan Hashmi), a small-time gun-dealer finds himself stuck between a cop (Randeep Hooda) who forces Sonu to turn into an informer; his willingness to live an honest living for the love of his life (Esha Gupta); and the bigger-time dons of the underworld (Manish Choudhary). A dilemma that could've been so much more engaging but for some awful performances and a tedious screenplay. Similarly, the dialogues are some of the most inane ones. The kind that actors should have objection to saying out loud, however inept they might be at their work. No, I'm not referring to perfunctorily used profanity Except for Emraan Hashmi, the rest of the cast is rather monotonous, each one seems to take to one expression and hold to it. This fact is more so evident in the cases of Randeep Hooda, Esha Gupta and Manish Choudhary. Anyway, as usual, the lead lady is made irrelevant in a crime saga. Despite all of this, I'd consider the climax one of the bravest ones in recent times. It is surprisingly unexpected for an otherwise predictable story. It is also an interesting one in terms of what it means to the various characters, even if they aren't written with too much depth. Yet, it can't take away from the fact that it is 'too little, and a little too late'. Jannat 2 is another one of those standard crime romances to come out of the Bhatt stable -  only less engaging than the average Vishesh Films' product.]"
429,"[""A film should be like a pebble in your shoe."" - Lars Von Trier Love stories come in all shapes and sizes. Some, like that of our very own Raj and Simran, make you root for the protagonists, they make you want the two to end up together. Then there are some, like my personal favourite, Casablanca, which make you feel like there is no love like one which is unrequited. And then, there is Mahesh Manjrekar's Kaksparsh, a complex love story unlike any other. Set across a time span of a few decades, the film starts off in pre-independence India, where Hari, a man of strict principles, is planning the wedding of his brother Mahadev, with the help of his close friend Balwant. Mahadev marries a teenaged girl, who hasn't even reached puberty yet. Tragedy strikes barely a few months later, as young Mahadev dies the very night they were to finally consummate their wedding. Then starts the journey of a complex, near-exasperating story - a love story. Kaksparsh can make some people uncomfortable, test the patience of some, perhaps even make a select few walk out. It poses questions for most of the narrative and resolves them at the end, only to pose new, larger and more difficult questions as it fades out. The most important of them - what, really, is love? Mahesh Manjrekar deserves appreciation, first for choosing this story to tell and then for the manner in which he has told it. The look, feel and mood that the film creates is first rate, even if the production design had a lot of scope to enhance the feel. One of Kaksparsh's triumphs is the cast of the film. Sachin Khedekar anchors the film with a solid performance. Playing a stubborn man with strong opinions and principles is far harder than it sounds. For such a character to achieve any level of credibility is a task, and he more than delivers. Ketki Mategaonkar and Priya Bapat who play the young widow Uma in different stages of her life are extremely likeable and believable. Sanjay Khapre as Balwant is extremely competent as well. His face radiates the sense of stability that his character is meant to emanate.Kaksparsh holds your attention because of little details and moments. The customs and rituals of a Brahmin family in pre-independence India, little things like the language the older brother uses in a letter to his younger brother, even the historical connection that has been made with the character of Balwant, all these moments lend a texture to the film. Even more intriguing are the scenes involving the life of a young widow in the backward Indian milieu - especially a widow who has been bereaved even before the marriage is consummated. Love isn't just about a man and woman having romantic feelings for each other. It is about how much you are willing to give up and how far you are willing to go for the person you claim to love. Kaksparsh deserves to be watched because the makers of the film dared to do something that few people do - tell a story that needed to be told, even if a majority of the audience will not identify with the characters and their motivations. It re-establishes Mahesh Manjrekar as a director with promise. Most importantly, it opens another trove of questions regarding what makes mankind unique as a race - the concept of love.]"
430,"[""Do appearances matter?"" Should they? This is the question Rajat Kapoor and Co try to answer with Fatso! Only that it would look too plain as is, and thus is masked with an interesting philosophical ""what if?"" What if you died by mistake? And the death-givers wanted to rectify their error in a controversial manner. It sound funny, but unfortunately Fatso isn't funny and neither does it take the philosophical inferences too seriously. So, it's neither entertaining nor engaging. It just stays something that could be.Yet, the performances work big time for Fatso. Be it Ranvir Shorey in the title role or the always affable Gul Panag or the charming Purab Kohli. They are the ones that make you sit through. They and the hope that it will all end with a smile on your face. Instead mid-way a fear starts creeping in that a film that banks on the emotional ties in the relationships is going to end up like any other romantic film - one in which people fall in love for the sake of convenience rather than growing into it organically. There are quite a few issues touched upon, but none of them are delved into more than superficially. From insensitivity of people to an obese person to a friend falling in love with his friend's girlfriend while having a girlfriend of his own - are all cursorily touched upon but not taken too seriously - almost as if the writer/director was scared of making his film too serious. Why have the person be fat and have a title and promo material revolve around the fact, if it isn't even central to the main story? Unfortunately, it isn't un-serious either. It hangs somewhere in between. Same goes for how the characters are written. They are all interesting more because you can relate to them, as friends if not yourself. But, you aren't exposed to their vulnerabilities or strengths. You are kept guessing and thus find yourself half-way there. Even so, there is something very pleasant about how the camera moves or how the lights are used in a Rajat Kapoor film that make it watchable despite content that isn't quite there. That and an attempt at a topic a little different, even if it's ripped off from here and there, is what makes me look forward to films from this camp of Hindi films. The exuberant display of what Fatso! loves life for is symbolic of the film itself. Starts off delightfully, but sticks to the idea for so long without coming to the point that you can predict the point and exactly how it's going to happen too. ]"
431,"[Juno is one of those films that make you forget that you're watching a film. I detest labels, but Juno is an indie film at its best - with subtle characterization, an endearingly refreshing soundtrack and a film with a basic agenda to just tell a story. And it's no wonder that Juno won the Academy Award for the Best Original Screenplay in 2007. After watching Juno, you won't be left with an over-powering cinematic feeling. You'll be left feeling like the character Juno in the film yourself, in a simplistically relatable way.Juno is about a 16 year old quirky girl (played by the remarkable Ellen Page) who is wiser beyond her age. She decides that her sexual curiosity has reached its peak and in order to satiate her, um, ""questions"" she chooses her best friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera). Unfortunately, she finds she is pregnant, and this film begins here. There's no over-dramatic love-making scene - what you remember from the 30 second glimpse of the two making love is that Bleeker's mouth tasted of Orange Tic-Tac - and it's what Juno remembers most as well.The film is broken into the 4 seasons, corresponding to Juno's trimesters. Juno decides she wants to give her child to deserving parents - the candidates are played by Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Gardner). Each character is almost pitch perfect, be it the adoptive couple, or Juno's sassy parents played by J K Simmons and Allison Janney. You can really see where Juno gets her quirkiness.  Juno is an extremely engaging film for many reasons - driven by a pure story, characters that make you want to rejoice and a childlike visual texture that just brightens the screen. But mostly, Juno's strongpoint is its simplicity. What's obvious is how the film doesn't make the whole abortion debate a bag of drama, and deals with it as Juno's experience. But beyond that you realize just how toned down it all is - every relationship that is determined by minute observations and every scene that expresses itself through dialogue that makes you feel like an inquisitive eaves-dropper. The DVD of Juno has some interesting features: a crackling audio commentary by director Jason Riteman and writer Diablo Cody. The commentary is funny, insightful and talks at length about their interpretation of Juno's character. Even here, the discussion isn't pointed towards the social debate about abortion, or pro-choice. The gag reel is hilarious, filled with profanity and each actor pulling the other's leg. It's the kind of humour you can see translate into the grammar of the film.There are 11 deleted scenes, and each one make you wish they were included in the film. I even tried it out where I would put it, and how it would then flow. When was the last time you remember doing that with deleted scenes? I would suggest every one of you to first buy the DVD, but also get hold of the entire extended soundtrack of the film, which unfortunately is not there on the DVD. Each song is so emblematic of the film; one quirkier than the other. And yet they merely breeze through in the film, almost like a wasp of cool air when you pass by an air-conditioner. But if you had to point to one thing in the film that stands out among the rest, it would be Ellen Page's performance. All of 20, she plays an eccentric girl full of back-slapped one liners and a bag of repartee, but even so, you just want to hug her. You can't miss Juno!]"
432,"[Tezz makes your brain go numb - with loud action sequences that accompany shoddy VFX, with its inane dialogue, with content that is mind-bogglingly dim-witted. An illegal immigrant gets so offended for being thrown out of UK that he comes back to threaten, takes along other illegal immigrants  to blow a couple of trains off and make demands of the government!? And the hope is that the his backstory is going to make the audience see the justification behind the actions of this ""anti-hero""?! Even if a part of the audience, like me, thinks of Aakash Rana (Ajay Devgan) more as a villain than an anti-hero, he's not loathsome enough to make Tezz watchable. And it is a huge disappointment in that villains who aren't absolutely nasty have such potential to make interesting characters. But here, Aakash seems as misguided as the writers, assuming there were writers involved in this project.Yep! Beginning to complain about the plot holes implies that there was a coherent plot. All I know is, if I start filling in the 'didn't work' section of the notepad in the opening sequence of a film, the next two hours are pretty much written off. While the film is more or less one chase sequence after the other - some of them well-choreographed, others interrupted by childish graphics and special effects - you wish text on screen said 'The End' when it reads 'Interval'. None of the main characters have roles that require too much emoting or even speaking - the latter is a good thing. Especially, when the potential speakers are the likes of Kangna Ranaut who made me cringe at her diction even for the two lines that she had. Actually both, she and Sameera Reddy, can barely be called ""lead"" characters. Of the lot, in fact Boman Irani followed by Anil Kapoor get some screen space that allows for at least some expressions. But, then they have such awful lines, that you wish they hadn't taken this film in the first place. Then you have the songs that are as out of place even if someone somewhere tried to justify it with some convoluted reason. Mallika Sherawat's 'laila' must be one of the worst choreographed and picturised item numbers of recent times. Tezz gives a weird sense of disappointment - the kind that you get even when you weren't expecting anything half-decent to begin with.]"
433,"[No doubt there is something very charming about a story line that starts with different threads and merges into one coherent story by the end. Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi kills that romanticized idea. It is indeed painful to write a review when you have only bad things to say about it. Except for the one quirky character Ajay Ghosh, Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi has nothing going for it. And this is despite having a cast that consists Kay Kay Menon and Ranvir Shorey!They do try their best, but what can they do with the little their individual threads do to contribute to the film. Individually a couple of their scenes work really well, but that's about it. But even that much cannot be said about Manu Rishi and Neha Bhasin's thread unless you call a hearty laugh at the writers, for calling Shakti Kapoor 'innocent looking', entertainment. Yes, it gets that crass at times. At others it alternates between plain silly and boring. It's difficult for me to get angry or hate something that a small budget film with a new director has tried to do. Life ki toh lag gayi only made me indifferent towards, which as is said, is worse than evoking hatred. ]"
434,"[You know the kind of cook shows that make you want to regret you had some mix veg nothing-ness for dinner? The kind that makes you forget you couldn't pronounce the French dish that is being cooked because it looks divine? When I first heard of Julie &amp; Julia, I thought the movie would make me feel just that - a nagging concern about where my life is going and why I'm not a successfully chef. Or at least a salivating regret on why I didn't have something more creative for dinner. The film is based on the lives of two women - an autobiographical texts by Julie Powell (played by Amy Adams), a hum-drum government employee who takes on the challenge to cook 524 recipes from Julia Child's book 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking' and Julia Child's life from her first cooking class to publishing her book. Both women in their own way admit that food saved their lives. The film draws parallels between the 1950s, when Julia Child (famous American chef, played by Meryl Streep) first started taking cooking lessons in Paris, and the early 2000s when Julie Powell's life changed with her super taxing challenge. We are made to see the similarities with both their lives even though they belong to different time zones and social brackets. Julia Child moved to Paris with her husband, Paul Child (played by Stanley Tucci) a plush government employee who is supportive of her zest to do something with her life - and not just play a domestic companion to him. Quite similar to Child, Powell decides her boring government job is pulling her down, especially since her friends have all climbed the ladder to success. She lives with her husband, nonchalant yet supportive Eric Powell (Chris Messina) above a pizzeria in Queens, New York. Her one year challenge, as you witness through the film, lifts up her life to extremes. She writes a blog about her daily accomplishments, and it becomes hugely popular. The cooking, however, is taxing. You are made aware of the pressure mostly because the film keeps cutting back to Julia Child's inspirational story of how she became a successful chef. The parallel narratives work well with these two stories, as they stand similar and contradictory in many ways. Both women fight with vastly different demons: Julie with her financial situation and job coming in the way of her aspirations, and Julia with the social mindset against women in Europe in the early 1900s. Women cooked at home, and we see Julia Child breaking that stereotype by standing in a room full of men, and a skeptical tutor, and making her own. Yet both women are searching for the same thing: a validation of their talent. Meryl Streep as Julia Child is a delight, but of course. You immediately choose your side, when you decide her side of the story is a tad bit more interesting than Julie Powell's. Amy Adams though, makes Powell's character a lot more endearing and relatable. Both husbands are shown to be extremely supportive of their wives career, but somewhere down the line, the characters get boring. I would have preferred more refined characters, especially since Nora Ephron (writer and director) decides to delve deep into the personal lives of both women. The DVD of Julia &amp; Julia has a bunch of really exciting extras. First up is a featurette titled ""Secret Ingredients: Creating Julie &amp; Julia"", in which we get to hear bits of the real Julie Powell and Julia Child's niece. We also get an overview of the production, and might I say, you can never get enough of Meryl Streep on screen! She's such a charm; you just want to keep watching her perform. A part of me wishes the film focused on making the viewer drool over the food in the film. Most food related shows/movies/books end up making you feel either hungry or inspire you to cook. I felt neither during Julie &amp; Julia, maybe because the focus was on the womens' trajectory and less on what was being cooked. While the performances are the main straw in Julie &amp; Julia, the film surprisingly doesn't make you want to cook or eat. It makes you want to sit back and ponder on the women and their achievements. That's a real win for the film, isn't it? ]"
435,"[Before watching the film, the most interesting pull factor about Kashala Udyachi Baat for me was that this was Anupam Kher's first ever Marathi film. Perhaps one of the most under-utilized actors of our times (partly due to his own doing), the fact that he was said to have dubbed for the film himself was an added bonus. However, Kashala Udyachi Baat, in spite of having an interesting concept at its core, is an unfulfilling effort, primarily because in an effort to get its message across, the film takes to sermonizing.Aditya Pradhan, played by Sachin Khedekar, is an ambitious, career-obsessed IT professional who has no time for those who should matter most in life. For him, they are a cursory duty that he needs to fulfill on his journey to professional success. Fed up with him when he misses an important event in his daughter's life, his wife, played by Mrinal Kulkarni, packs her bags and leaves for home with her daughter. Groundhog Day then takes over for a while as Aditya Pradhan is stuck in a time loop - he wakes up every day to the same day, a Sunday - a means for him to savour the finer nuances of life. In comes a mysterious blind stranger, who acts like a beacon for him in his state of the eternal Sunday.Directed by Pramod Joshi, Kashala Udyachi Baat does have its moments, something that goes without saying. A time loop concept will always be interesting, because there is always a magnetic charm to the idea of non-linearity in life. However, when the time loop is over-done, the concept can begin to grate, much like the cacophony of his neighbours that Aditya Pradhan has to wake up to every Sunday. Adding insult to the injury caused by the draggy screenplay is an item number that really finds no place in this film.Sachin Khedekar is a talented actor, of that there is no doubt. In fact, one can often see why he was chosen to play this part. He is a natural when it comes to showing the exasperation that an ordinary man can feel with his life. However, he is one of those actors who continuously needs to be reined in, because over-the-top comes as naturally to him as subtle does. Mrinal Kulkarni is another actor who I am extremely fond of simply because of the presence that she exudes. Though she doesn't get much to do in this film, her appearance is always a joy. Anupam Kher does a fairly decent job, even with his Marathi, although it did seem a little stilted. I also often got the feeling that it wasn't his voice at all, although that could be just my imagination. What is good to see is that actors like him and Naseeruddin Shah (in Deool) are featuring in Marathi films. Hopefully, this will provide the much-needed fillip to an industry that deserves it.Apart from the said item number, Kashala Udyachi Baat feels like an honest effort. What happens invariably though, is that the film veers towards being preachy and moralizing. Yes, there is more to life than work and success. But hammering it on the audience's head might not entirely get the message across. The film looks and feels right, but mediocre writing will always sink a film, no matter what. The film is a half-decent effort, but a sharper, more insightful screenplay would have made it truly worth a watch. As it stands though, the film is really just something you could switch to on TV if the other options are re-telecasts of Golmaal or Ghajini.]"
436,"['Mi anandasathi kahich karat nahin, anandani karto' (I don't do things for happiness, I do them happily) proclaims Dilip Prabhavalkar, who plays an eccentric scientist who conducts experiments for social good in his homegrown lab - experiments that often go BOOM! This line, and indeed Dilip Prabhavalkar's character, is one of the many quirky aspects of Masala, produced by Umesh Kulkarni and Girish Kulkarni, the men behind Deool.Directed by debutante Sandesh Kulkarni, Masala is another feather in the cap of National Award winner Girish Kulkarni, one of the finds of Indian cinema in recent times. If Deool was though-provoking in an obvious manner, Masala takes a slightly different route to make you think - it makes you smile. Girish Kulkarni and Amruta Subhash play a young married couple who are constantly on the run from creditors. Their life is just a cycle wherein they go to a new place, set up shop, end up owing money to people because they themselves are owed money and ultimately end up sneaking away to a new place in the midst of the night. Along the way, they face situations and meet characters that are like milestones in their quest for a state of equilibrium. While every character in Masala makes you smile, a closer inspection will reveal that they stand for so much more than what they appear to be on the surface - Dilip Prabhavalkar's mad scientist for example - an analogy can be drawn between his life and the life of our protagonist couple.  While Girish Kulkarni's performance undoubtedly needs to be lauded, it is his writing that is the real star of Masala. With crackling, insightful dialogue and a screenplay that makes the film a true journey for the characters as well as the audience, Girish Kulkarni once again proves the old adage - content is ultimately king. Amruta Subhash also delivers an earnest performance as his wife. She is charming and sincere and you truly feel for her character of a woman who stands by her husband like a rock. Of course, watching actors like Dr. Mohan Agashe and Dilip Prabhavalkar is always a joy. Their characters are like mirrors for the protagonist. It is through them that his journey seems to acquire meaning. Dr. Shreeram Lagoo's name on the poster of the film excited me, and his brief appearance was heart-warming as always, even though I least expected him to appear as the character he played in the film. Another place where the film exceeded my expectations was its technique. Masala is visually appealing in terms of its cinematography, even though one can easily tell which shots were taken with a DSLR. Also, a special mention must be made of the background score. It seemed to hit just the right note when the situation demanded it, complimenting the character's state of mind well. I did have some reservations about the manner in which the film was edited, but they were more on the creative side rather than the technical. I would perhaps have structured the film slightly differently, but I'd have to watch the film again to be sure. In fact, Masala is one of the only Marathi films I've seen lately which I feel like watching twice, only because something tells me that in all of the humour and charm, I may have missed out on something that lay far deeper. I only hope that as many people as possible watch this film at least once, if only to spend some time in their life smiling a real smile. ]"
437,"[Mirror Mirror isn't a revisit to the age-old fairy-tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, nor is it a satire. The first thing you'll notice while watching the film is how it's a celebration of the fairy-tale with a concrete contemporary flavour. Fairy-tales are meant to have a universal moral that is passed on for generations, and Mirror Mirror manages to hold that moral and still give the film an interestingly relatable treatment. Julia Roberts plays the evil queen, and by the look of it, rather enjoys her sinister position of authority. We are told the story through her perspective; you instantly figure out this version of Snow White is going to be entertaining. She plays a vain, insecure queen who locks up an 18 year old Snow White in order to maintain her position. The King is dead, and Snow White (played by Lily Collins) is the rightful ruler of the land, but the Queen is willing to do anything to keep her away. Snow White is no tormented damsel in distress though. She escapes the palace to realize the kingdom is in ruins, where the villagers who once used to sing and dance, are now broke and starving. The fun (or what you would call conflict) begins when Snow White meets the Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer of the Social Network fame) and later we realize the Queen wants to marry him for his money. The interactions between the Queen and the Prince are charming, as you see Roberts behave like a drooling cougar, pouncing on ever opportunity to flirt with him. White, on the other hand, encounters the 7 dwarves in the Forest and together they plot to free the land from the Evil Queen's hold. Mirror Mirror's strongest point is its elaborate sets and costumes. Colorful landscapes, beefed up gowns and frilly collars give the film a grand and dramatic feel - you feel like every character has come alive from a vibrant children's story book.  However, Lily Collins and Hammer are rather forgettable in their characters, and their love seems hurried and sugar-coated.The strongest performance (with no surprises) is Julia Roberts'. Even so, the ""true love"" between Snow White and the Prince isn't established enough, and Roberts' could have easily been a tad bit more evil and sassy. The effort to make the film more clever and enjoyable seems laborious and borders on predictable. The film revels in its ability to subvert tradition - in a brilliant scene as a parody to artificial beauty, the queen gets her lip stung by a bee to enhance it. The idea is not to portray that the women were born beautiful but that even Queens and Princesses from fairy-tales need to touch up. The film isn't laden with preachy deductions but allows you to enjoy a contemporary re-telling - Snow White learns to use a sword in order to fight her own battle, the dwarves aren't Robin-Hood thieves but actual bandits and the prince is most certainly not a Knight in shining armor. Mirror Mirror is an entertaining weekend watch and something the children will love especially if they are aware of the original fairy-tale. It could have been a shorter, crisper film with memorable dialogues (like a play on stereotypical things that characters from fairy-tales say) but the film has a bunch of moments to keep you engaged. ]"
438,"[If we are lucky enough to have a potential Hrishikesh Mukherjee amongst us, it would have to be Shoojit Sircar. Vicky Donor made me laugh, brought a tear to my eye, made me think, and it made me care about its characters - all in a setting we could accept as real-life. And it's not like the film doesn't have a good share of quirky characters (We have a whisky drinking granny, for goodness' sake!) but their quirks are made to look like they could easily belong to a neighbor's family, if not your own. For a subject as taboo and giggle-inducing as 'sperm donation', Vicky Donor does an awesome job of making it so regular even though the terms thrown at you are on-the-face. Each time Anu Kapoor says 'sperm' with a hand-gesture it makes you laugh out loud, right till the end. That's how good his comic timing is - that a signature phrase and symbol assigned to a character makes you laugh despite the repetition. Also, that's how good the writing is - because the time passed between two repetitions is just right and the things that come between them is either hilarious or entertaining, if not both. Yes, there is some non-hilarious entertainment. The drama and the romance are both engaging. After a really long time, I didn't have any problem believing a couple when they said they loved each other. Otherwise, either it is said too early, or one is blind to the other's love, or it is too mushy, or the lines are ridiculously shallow. Vicky Donor gets the romance 'Goldilocks' perfect.Same goes for the drama. This coming from a member of the audience who thinks she's has had just about enough of loud Punjabi characters and dialogue thrown at her. Beeji (Kamlesh Gill), Dolly (Dolly Ahluwalia) and the daughter-in-law-mother-in-law chemistry between them isn't something we are going to forget in a hurry and yet will want to revisit them every once in a while. I like Ayushman Khurana - even beyond his dimples. He has an easy-going screen presence that any actor should be proud of. His easy-go-lucky Punjabi munda mannerism is so casual that it is difficult to imagine him as any other character. I guess we'll have to wait for his next for that. Yami Gautam has a sweet charm that makes you reach out to the sadness within her when she's smiling, comfort her when she's obviously sad and identify with her PMS-ing shrill yelling when she's angry. Each character has depth and warmth - even the pushy Dr. Chaddha (Anu Kapoor) and his alter ego in the form of his assistant. Ashima's (Yami Gautam) dad and aunt add their own flavor to the mix - especially the scenes written between father and daughter. The extent to a dad can go to convince his daughter of anything - from choice of husband to how she's being silly in being upset with her husband - might seem outlandish, but we've all seen or heard of similar stuff in real-life.The screenplay is intriguing too. It is rather obviously episodic, it has five clear parts. The first which is covered in the promos where Dr. Chaddha is trying to convince Vicky to donate his sperm. Then you have Vicky wooing Ashima followed by an amazingly witty coverage of inter-caste marriage - a subject covered to death by Hindi cinema. The second half sombers up to cover more serious issues and the entire do has a clean albeit slightly mushy wrap-up. And in the midst of all this, you have a social message that never becomes preachy and will thus be effective, when a family faces an issue like this. After walking out of the theater, the superficial thoughts are that of having had fun for the last two hours, of having watched a good film. But half an hour later, when you have processed the film as a whole, I realized I liked it even more than I thought. And it is primarily because of this - Vicky Donor has so many elements that I thought I've had enough of and would've very grudgingly given benefit of doubt to any filmmaker or writer to cover even one of them with any freshness. But boy-meets-girl, Punjabi madness, repetitive dialogue/phrases, caste-based family issues, post-marital woes and recovery from them - Vicky Donor covers them all with a smile on its face and mine. It could be because it has a novel concept to tie this all in. Who would've thought that could happen?*wogma and Bollywood and Fashion present the Vicky Donor contest. Tell us how you'd react if you are told that your friend is a Vicky donor and win filmy t-shirts!]"
439,"[Isn't it a shame that a woman has been so wronged by such an obnoxious man and I feel bad for her only conceptually? Only my imagination of what it must have been like evokes any kind of emotion out of me? And this is in the first half hour of the film. My exasperation only gets worse as the Hate Story progresses.In the entire film, there are only two things that are just about okay. One is Gulshan Devaiya's stammer and the other is the attempt at making the story a business-mind game. But these are barely things that I can call that 'work' or 'are going for the film'. They just happen to be there for me to be able to say at least a few things nice about the film. Okay fine, Nikhil Dwivedi broods just about right. Talking about Paoli Dam's performance would involve recalling her whispering and sighing in attempt to seduce, which I'm trying my best to resist. And...""ha ha ha ha ha ha"" this is a ROFL at those who went in expecting sizzling, explicit sex based on the promos. Little do they know they've seen all there is to see in the trailer itself. In fact,  the uncensored version of the trailer has even a little more than the film. And another, ""ha ha ha ha ha ha"" at me - for wondering, even for the slightest moment, if Hate Story would finally be the Hindi film that shows two people can be comfortable with their bodies and themselves while having sex. Now, the whole idea behind having the lead lady turn into a top-notch call-girl is obviously to be able to market the film. Then, I am giving it too much benefit of doubt by thinking, ""Sure they didn't tell me exactly why she HAD to turn into a prostitute, but maybe it was the easiest way for her to get what she wanted."" One thing Hate Story does a god job of, is to expose the fragility of the male ego. One male after another falls for this woman whose focus is only her revenge and not one relents even after they know the truth about her. But then again, you don't need to see a movie for that, do you? runs for shelter Oh, the other selling point in the trailer seemed to be the free use of cuss words. Character after character uses the f-word more awkwardly than 12-year olds who use that language. Unfortunately, everything in Hate Story sounds and looks contrived with the sole motivation of getting the audience to the theater - by hook or crook. And it doesn't quite work.]"
440,"[Forgive my comparison, but this year The Descendants has almost taken on the same avatar as last year's little gem, The King's Speech i.e. a feel good film that brightens your day and also, wins all the movie awards. While the films are widely apart in their premise, the one thing you can be certain of is that it will be one of the most emotionally captivating films you would have seen till date. The beauty of The Descendants lies in its exterior - the visual picture gives you no clue about the journey you're about to take with the film. With the backdrop of the serene and beach-y Hawaiian islands, the film tracks Matt King (Clooney) and his family's journey as the family tries to cope with a great loss. They are also left with a large plot of land from their ancestors: a non-touristy, beautiful piece of the island that King, as the sole trustee of the land, has to decide the outcome of. They lose the lease in 7 years. King and his two daughters set the ball rolling as a perfectly dysfunctional family. Along with the land decisions, a tragedy occurs in the family when his wife hits her head rather hard in a boating accident. This leaves King alone with his children while the wife is in coma. And that is not the only tragedy.Clooney as Matt King is emotionally defensive; however the elder daughter Alex (the radiant Shailene Woodley) has troubles with alcohol and a general adolescent angst. The other daughter Scottie (Amara Miller, also the cutest of the lot) deals with her own personal rebellion of the absence of a mother figure. Both young actors are sassy and have a cracking chemistry that serve as a funny sidetrack from the serious business. They are all running in different directions and you almost want to sit them down and comfort them separately. Such is the first quarter of the film, which fills you with concern and frustration as an empathetic viewer. It's not a complimentary bond, and therefore you wonder about placing a film that deals with the sense of loss and rejection in a locale that oozes tranquility. However, the Hawaiian island serves as a perfect catalyst for such a setting. Director of photography, Phedon Papamichael brings out this conflict beautifully. For every emotionally heavy scene, the following cut-away has a sense of hope and calm. The background music is almost surreal; country music coupled with part soothing, part peppy Hawaiian vocals that you would imagine playing in a beach shack. This entire package plays out as an oxymoron, bringing out with even more conviction the brewing storm in every character's head. Clooney is a charm, as the virtual torchbearer of the film, playing single dad in mostly a pair of plain polo t-shirts and colorful Bermuda shorts. He himself asks you not to take the get up seriously; most influential people in the city dress down and casual. We see CEOs in the same avatar; even in a scene when Clooney breaks serious news to his extended family, they're wearing floral dresses and shirts. This becomes a beautiful routine in the film - between the windy palm trees, floral wear and Hawaiian music you experience a deep familial connect with the story. A shout out to the other characters in the film that grow on you immensely - Robert Forster as Elizabeth's (the wife) father is temperamental and scenes between him and the rest of the family are all nerve and smiles. Another special mention is of older daughter Alex's boyfriend (Nick Krause) who is hilariously annoying, and manages to win your heart with his goofy-ness. Clooney's subtle character growth goes in tandem with the sometimes humorous, sometimes deep narrative. It's a character-driven story that manages to beautifully weave into an intelligent and expressive film. Each subsidiary character brings something extra to the table, as you connect with their personal voice in the film (you cry along with Scottie when she is told about her mother, you want to tell Alex to be a bit more sensitive to her dad who is dealing with his own baggage and suchlike). Don't miss The Descendants, as you accompany the film on its path to self-discovery with a warm story. ]"
441,"[I walked out of Battleship this weekend wondering if we could ever create innovative alien-invasion movies. They're so predictable I wish I were getting paid for my thoughts on what came next. In Battleship, the American Navy with all its machismo is our savior - protecting the world from the wrath of the extra-terrestrials. It's ironical however, that they choose Rihanna to be on the posters of the film, while you have Liam Neeson (most noted for Schindler's List) and Taylor Kitsch (X-Men and John Carter) playing more relevant characters. The film begins with American scientists sending radio signals into space (thankfully it's a tad more skillfully done than Koi Mil Gaya) in the hope of finding life in other planets. We all know that's a wrong move - the chance of a blue cute thing with magic powers to appear is quite slim for a big-budgeted Hollywood film. In 3D. Long story short: Giant aliens arrive through the sea with massive transforming spaceships with the intention to invade Earth. It is then the responsibility of a small Navy team off the coast of Hawaii to save the world. The team is headed by Officer Alex Hooper (Taylor Kitsch). Rihanna plays the arms officer on Hooper's warship. She's every man's fantasy in that sense, (a portrayal which is definitely a problem) as she handles guns and screams out in authority every now and then. The problem is, we are given no back story to her involvement in the American Navy, or even reasoning to her brutal character. Actually, none of the characters have any inter-personal relationships as such. We keep cutting between their apocalyptic discussions and VFX-heavy action sequences.Such films usually rely on their grand looking action. Battleship however, is just a lot boom-boom-boom. Too much noise, and mindless non-dramatic action. There's no tension built up between the evil alien invaders and the courageous human fighters. Not even with background music, which seems such a staple in action-heavy films. Rihanna's a plus in the film though, with her army clothes, handling the guns rather well. You've got to give her some credit for making her debut is such a mindless film, and makling it seem like she really bagged a role of a lifetime. The last 30 minutes of Battleship is really what you expect from the film: unadulterated action with no build-up or logic to it. Loud background score, which induces no feelings in you, just makes you wonder if you'll ever be able to hear properly again, and no sense of achievement whatsoever. Hearing a death-metal band vocalist scream would be a better exercise for your ears. My suggestion is, watch the film if you are nuts about Rihanna, or if you really don't want to use your brains at all. But don't curse me if you still come out having a sense of wasted time. ]"
442,"[Bittoo Boss feels like a vehicle that is approaching the end of its life. It troubles you while taking off, giving you a sinking feeling that it's not going to run at all. Then it suddenly kick-starts, and just when it looks like it could give some mileage, it jerks and stalls before finally dying on you. Given that Bittoo Boss wants to awaken its audience to the vanity of the porn industry, the narrative it uses is alternately decent and preachy. And the latter is where it gets annoying, not to mention what happens between the two is amateur and leap frog-ish, jumping from point A to point B without using a reasonably understandable flow.For example, the way the lead lady, Mrinalini (Amita Pathak) falls in and out of love is unconvincing each time it happens - both the ins and the outs. Similarly, our man Bittoo's (Pulkit Samrat) choice of career change is rather sudden given his ideologies thus far. Yet, what happens after this, is a tiny bit unpredictable in that typically a hero whose self-respect has been hurt in the name of money, would usually fall prey to all the no-nos before realizing it's not him. But Bittoo is rather self-aware in comparison. This is a pleasant surprise and he wriggles his way out smoothly even if it is a little too easily. There was something about Pulkit Samrat that didn't gel well with me in the promos, but he sort-of grows on me in a very Ranveer Singh, a la Band Baaja Baaraat kind-of a way. Except for his hair, even though my brain told me often enough that that's what a lad from the interiors who thinks he's cool, would think is cool. There are moments in the second half where Pulkit shows his care for other characters with the warmth in his eyes. That it was very sudden and in the face, is a totally different issue. Amrita Pathak, acted well, but also constantly reminded me of my struggle between being unhappy with only good-looking people in the lead and having to sit 2+ hours looking at not-so good-looking people as a part of the audience. The problem here was also, that the lady doesn't have that screen presence which could have covered up for the non-glamorous persona she has. The quirky cabbie-cum-assistant that Bittoo enrolls in the second half looks awful and yet has an awesome screen presence. That actor (name anyone? - Ashok Pathak, thanks for the information Pradeep!) is one of the takeaways for me from Bittoo Boss, despite being sleazy. Another takeaway, is the subtle way in which Bittoo Boss tries to point out that there is a lot beyond sex that goes on in a bedroom and that is where the crux of our emotions lie. And that sex is the most innocent expression of all. Agree or disagree, a pretty insightful thing for a film to try to say. Unfortunately, Bittoo Boss also ends up getting preachy about it. That and that it goes haywire in the last twenty minutes with all sorts-of new dimensions being added to the mix. Moreover, the entire film misses a zing, an energy (that shows only in the first song) that can hold attention. wogma presents ''Bittoo ne le li"" contest in association with Bollywood and Fashion.Bittoo ko lene do photo, tum tshirt jeeto!

443,"[It has been a while since a film made me smell the earthen floor of a hut, the tulsi (holy basil) in the courtyard, the fragrance that rises when you spill water on the soil of dry, hot land. Baboo Band Baaja isn't the first film to be set in rural Maharashtra, but it is one of those films that will not leave me in a hurry, no matter how many Housefulls and Golmaals I watch along the way. A poignant, touching tale of a simple family, Baboo Band Baaja has been made with the kind of honesty and sincerity that is rare to find in Indian cinema today.Jaggu is a man who runs a band that plays at every occasion in the village, be it a funeral or a marriage. A band that he has named after his only son, Baboo. Baboo's mother does odd jobs for a living and has big dreams for her son - she wants to educate him in the best possible manner, against all odds. But their circumstances are such that they can't even afford to buy him a school uniform. Jaggu, on the other hand, believes that his son should take after him in the band, since that is what the men in their family have been doing for generations. Stuck in the middle is Baboo, a bright little kid who is always thrown out of class for some reason or the other. The film is essentially the story of the cards that life deals this troubled family and how they cope with them. The most striking aspect of this film is the lead cast. Milind Shinde as Jaggu, Vivek Chabukswar as little Baboo and Mitali Jagtap Varadkar as his mother play their parts so well that, for the first time in many years, I forgot I was watching a film. The connect with the characters, their joys, their sorrows, with their very lives felt so real that when the lights came on, first in the interval and then at the end, it felt like a jolt back to reality. No wonder then that Mitali and young Vivek won National Awards for their performances in this film.Director, Pinjani deserves full marks for treating the film the way he has. When making a film like this, it is easy to get over-indulgent. But Rajesh Pinjani keeps any form of indulgence to a minimum, letting the village setting and the spontaneity of his cast do the talking instead. Also, a special mention must go to the editor of the film, Santosh Gothoskar. There is only one thing I can say about him - he has edited the film with love. Baboo Band Baaja is really about the little nuances of life that the director chooses to show - the love that a mother has for her child, the frustrated existence of a man who has resigned himself to the fact that neither he nor his son can ever rise above their financial problems, the spirited grandmother who warms your heart every time she protects the little child from a thrashing, the pride that a mother feels when her son recites the tables of 2. Every little scene evokes a little bit of warmth, a little bit of sorrow, and a whole lot of wonder at the choices that the debutante director makes in the journey of the film.Baboo Band Baaja manages to take a slice out of village life and place it before audiences who are ordinarily subjected to, well, tripe. Like Deool, it is one of those films that makes the Marathi film industry proud. I only hope that there are enough screens that are showing this film with subtitles, so that the audience is not limited to only people who understand Marathi. Baboo Band Baaja is a film worth investing in, not just financially, but emotionally as well.]"
444,"[Kaakha Kaakha  (remade in Hindi recently as Force is another story that surrounds the idea of vendetta, but it manages to stay with you well after the end of film because it is treated in a manner that makes an instant connection. Gautham Menon uses many cliches in Kaakha Kaakha: good versus evil, how opposites attract and the eternal celebration of sacrifice but it's his racy script, Surya's crisp performance and Harris Jeyraj's music that makes the film an investing watch.  I remember reading an interview (and I read a lot of them, courtesy my  obsession with Surya) which mentions the first spark between the two flew during the filming of the song, 'Uyirin Uyire' and it was such a passionate film schedule, they were married before they knew it. Of course, I had to buy the DVD, and after watching the film I was left with the same feeling - a story that had me so involved, with it's simple plot but earnest display of emotions, I'd forgotten that I spent well over 2 hours watching a film. Unlike Force, Kaakha Kaakha doesn't resort to many gimmicks - (No beefed-up hero picking up a motor-bike and throwing it like a strawberry and the likes). It's a gripping plot, played out with a sense of ease and with the genuine need to tell a story. Anbuselvan (Surya) is an IPS officer, working in the Narcotics Department of the Police force and for as long as he can remember he has been on the right side of law.The film begins with a team being formed, headed by Anbuselvan to break the Narcotics rackets across the city. Special training is being undertaken for this mission - all of which is shown to us in well-cut montages. Just before this you are given the peg of the film - he's a stern officer with the advantage of not having a family or emotional responsibility. When he meets Maya, as an audience you instantly know what his plight is going to be. Maya (played by the beautiful Jyothika) is a middle-school teacher and as opposite to Anbu as can be, with all her charm and radiance. While this is a run-off-the-mill opposites attract pairing, you forgive this cliche because their chemistry is almost contagious. While they explore their relationship (through a few songs, his resistance to give into his feelings, her naivete against his professional life and the dangers involved), you are also secretly hoping that their love won't come in the way of Anbu's high-risk job.The film picks pace when Anbu has to fight to keep his relationship out of the spotlight with Pandya (played by Jeevan), a mafia-gang leader who cracks Anbu's weakness. While this premise is enough to grip you, unlike Vidyut Jammwal in Force, the villains in Kaakha Kaakha  aren't as menacing as would have been apt. Especially considering Surya's brilliant performance as Anbu could have done with an equal opposite force; a threateningly psychotic character would have brought out Anbu's plight much more. However, Gautham Menon makes up for this with absorbing action sequences. It's a fresh change to see that a romance angle, in an action film, hasn't been forced for the sake of entertainment but has been duly justified in the plot.A few songs and characters were out of place, like Maya's friend or Anbu's fellow officer, but mostly you would be better off watching Kaakha Kaakha over Force. It's far more earnest, the chemistry palpable and performances impressive (Jyothika's a lot more tolerable than chirpy Genelia). Besides, Surya is way better eye candy. The DVD of Kaakha Kaakha has no features, while the subtitles were apt and synced (I could make out with my broken understanding in Tamil that the translations were rather literal). Mostly you should invest and buy the DVD because Kaakha Kaakha is a pleasantly watchable film - it isn't flawless or a masterpiece but it has an extremely investing narrative.]"
445,"[One more filmmaker realizes the difference between paper and celluloid. Pravin Raja Karale, the director of Bokad, must have felt that the script in his hand had something in it that drove him to make the film. In fact, I refuse to believe that there is a filmmaker anywhere in the world who sets out to make a film with material that he knows is absolute, universal trash. (Yes, even Sajid Khan.) It is that Tolkien-esque journey from paper to film that makes cinema the very driving force behind the existence of some of us. Bokad has a premise that could easily have sounded convincing on paper. A group of college kids from Mumbai go on a field trip to a village, only to be embroiled in the whims of rural life and the political games that are played at the very grassroots of the gigantic pseudo-democratic edifice that controls our existence. And the village sarpanch's goat is at the centre of it all, like a mute, near-inconsequential metaphor for honour, pride and respect. Ignoring the distinct possibility that none of what I wrote above crossed the filmmakers' minds, what the viewers end up with is a mess of a film, put together with all the ability required to set up a toddler's game of 'house-house'.To make matters worse, the makers decided to go with 20 songs in the film, and I'm not even exaggerating. So one miserably choreographed song with more left feet than in all of the Western hemisphere pops up every five minutes, supposedly to 'unfold the mystery behind the story' [sic].The most perplexing aspect of this film is undoubtedly the casting. The unfortunate young men and women playing the collegians also turn up as villagers, reporters and even background extras at various points in the film. I spent much of the first half believing that this was some kind of inspired cinematic decision, giving the makers the credit for doing something so blatantly avant-garde, showing the finger to purists and saving some money at the same time. Eventually however, I came to the conclusion that they were just saving money, cinematic expression be damned. In fact, at various times I felt that Bokad was truly a lost opportunity. There was so much that could have been done when juxtaposing the beliefs and behaviour of Mumbai-based youth in a rural setting. Even something as simple as the yearning for non-vegetarian food is brought up very smartly and then squandered away. Village level politics is also touched upon, then relegated to the sidelines as the focus shifts to tomfoolery and a half-baked love story.Sayaji Shinde and Kishore Kadam, spotted earlier in some of Ram Gopal Varma's films, are the picks of the cast. Devious theatrics seem to come naturally to these performers, and they have the ability to hold your attention as they flirt dangerously with the boundaries of acting and over-acting. The rest of all of those who walk in and out of frames are just there, like the folded paper one would stuff under a rickety table's leg to temporarily stabilize it.Poor writing and a mediocre cast look even worse when combined with the dated feel of the film. In all of this, it is the goat from the title of the film that gets a raw deal. Talked about throughout, the poor fellow gets barely any screen time at all. Perhaps he was used as a metaphor for this film itself. Bokad is just one of those films that will come and go without so much as a whimper. ]"
446,"[I have a nasty reputation of crying at the drop of a hat during sentimental movies. My theory is it all started with my first viewing of Titanic, in 1997. I was a child, unaware of the tragedy of the film. I barely connected with Rose or Jack as an 8 year old, but I cried at every remotely emotional moment, by virtue of the overwhelming feeling that Titanic imparts with. Nearly 15 years later, as a 23 year old, I still cried the same amount after watching Titantic in 3D. I still felt the same rush of emotions through the film: anticipation, heart fluttering and mush even though I tried to fight it. I'll admit I was expecting to be blown away by the 3D technology, especially in the last half hour of the film, but it merely remained a subtle layer of the film. However, of all the films that are being shot/projected in 3D, Titanic seemed the most logical choice - mostly because of the grandeur of the film. The use of 3D doesn't make you cringe at any point, or make you feel like it was a waste of an alteration or your money. The 3D holds your gaze - when the piles of delicate plates fall off the rack, when each compartment gets flooded with water - you feel a lot closer to the on-screen happenings.  By virtue of that, Titanic in 3D is worth watching on the big screen. For those of you who have forgotten what the film is about, it's a revisit to the 1912 tragedy of Titanic. After been hit by an iceberg in the wee hours of the morning, the ""unsinkable"" ship Titanic sunk to bottom of the ocean taking with it close to 1500 people. James Cameron's Titanic portrays the love between young Rose and Jack Dawson who meet on the ship. Theirs is a clandestine affair, as they belong to different social backgrounds. Rose is aristocratic, and has a fiance. Her life is already decided for her at the age of 17. She meets Jack, a vagabond artist who changes her perception of life. Its puppy love at its best - also some of our first ever memories of love seen on the big screen (atleast my generation). Along with Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On', the entire package became sort of an anthem of love for us. I remembered telling myself as a 10 year old that I want to marry someone like Jack. Surprisingly, when I saw the film again this time, I was still that 10-year-old girl. That's the beauty of Titanic. It wraps you in its story and doesn't let you age for the 3 and a half hours that it runs. Titanic is not a film - it's a timeless pop-cultural reference for every movie lover. No matter how much we talk about it, there will still be more to discuss and reminisce. Nobody dare called it melodramatic when it was released - and I'm sure the last on your mind when you watch it on the big screen will be melodrama. Sure, the visuals and background music are grand, but a small part of you sinks with the Titanic. It's a part that will continuously haunt you every time you watch the film, and James Cameron has banked on that emotion with a re-release of the film. Watch Titanic in 3D for every reason you watched it the first time around, and every time it glued you when it came on TV. You might not feel anything new, but you will walk out with a warm feeling in your heart. ]"
447,"[It's difficult to call the makers of Housefull 2 mindless or unintelligent. There's no way someone can make something so silly and not know it. It requires a high level of awareness to write and make a film so profoundly senseless. And from the manner in which the entire audience was laughing it looks like they have done their homework on what the 'first day first show' audience enjoys. Of course, none of this newfound admiration converts me into that part of the audience that enjoys such humor.Given how little typical slapstick makes me laugh, it was almost a miracle that I laughed hard at a couple of the 'repeat phrase/expression' assigned to a couple of characters. And of course, they had to go ahead and spoil it by repeating it, for what feels like, a few hundred times! And that's the problem with films like these. They don't know where to stop, neither with their specific jokes nor the film itself. It's high time, we make it mandatory for writers to spend a year just on the climax. The utter tomfoolery in the last 20-30 minutes makes you want to bang your head on a wall harder than you were doing thus far. What with one of the worst opening sequences ever. Yet, a part of me is in awe of the writer's capacity to keep the utter chaos amongst twelve lead characters at a peak through most of the film. Of course again, I didn't enjoy the chaos but I certainly couldn't stop admiring how the writers seemed to have the story straight in their head amidst absolute commotion. The writing also attempts at a wide range of tools to create humor - from puns to rhymes to toilet humor to sexual jokes to sarcasm to 'pet phrases/expressions' to mimicry to what-say-you. Some work, most don't. Almost all repeat. Also, for a change I enjoyed Akshay Kumar and John Abraham's comic timing. Before it became repetitive. Amongst the women Asin gets a teeny-weeny bit to display her ability to make people laugh. While Riteish Deshmukh and Shreyas Talpade have as banal and inconsequential roles as the rest of the women, they at least are not insulted for being the gender they belong to. Please appreciate the amount of control I've maintained in not going all out and on and on about how ridiculously stupid ALL the women in the film are. Also, the lesser I say about the veterans  the quicker I'll be able to forget how insulted I felt by watching them in such menial roles. Housefull 2 is one of those rare films where I looked forward to the song breaks - nice, colorful, well-dressed good-looking people. That just about describes Housefull 2 in its entirety except that the film has some not-so-good-looking people too. Housefull 2 made me want to experience what it is the writers were having when they wrote it. Worry not, just as an experiment, one should know what it feels like, no? * What is your most 'kuchh bhi kya!?' moment of Housefull 2? Tell us and win Bollywood-themed tees!

448,"[When I first watched Mike Nichol's Closer, I had to remind myself that he also directed film likes The Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. While the former is a rather one-dimensional narrative about a relationship between a younger man and an older woman, the latter plays around with the idea of complex relationships involving two couples, breaking all moulds of structure. To me, that stood as the perfect backdrop for Closer, which also explores the complex and inter-mingling relationship of two couples. And yet somehow, Closer is also trying to break your security blanket of simplicity, as a viewer. Alice (Natalie Portman) and Dan (Jude Law) meet on the street in a bizarre manner, owing to instant attraction. A year later, Dan has moved from writing obituaries to writing a book on Alice, who is a stripper and as you grow with her, you realize she's a vulnerable, complex individual with a little too much love for drama. He then meets Anna, a photographer, (Julia Roberts) while publicizing his book, as she photographs his portfolio. In a more sinister setting, Dan pretends to be Anna in a lewd chat room and lures Larry (Clive Owen), who's a dermatologist, to meet her in an aquarium. Each individual character explores their personal relationship with one another, with chance meetings, forced interactions and sexual relationships that aren't left to any explanations. Why, you ask? Because Closer doesn't claim to explore labels; like monogamy, morality and suchlike. While it's a film about complexity in human relationships, the question it is trying to ask is not, ""Why would Dan sleep with Anna when he is with Alice?"" but ""On what basis do we chart our liaisons?""It becomes extremely difficult to move beyond characterization in Closer. The film is shot beautifully, where tight shots and angles are incorporated to suit the mood of the scene. You move through dislike and fondness for all four characters while they are being portrayed - visually and emotionally. While Portman as Alice is naive and childishly thespian, Anna is quite the opposite with her inability to express the inner recesses of her mind. Julia Roberts is brilliantly cast for a silently volatile role like Anna. Dan catches on to the mysterious charm that Anna exudes, while she chooses to express bits and pieces of it with both Larry and him. Larry is like a typical savior. He moves between being a security blanket and a possessive maniac. It becomes a gripping visual when we see him (as with the other characters) switch between his roles. Closer is a character driven film. My personal favorite character remains Alice. She's young, and brings with her every baggage that a young person carries: Naivete that translates into harsh judgments and impulsive decisions. Impulsiveness that translates into disregard for anything logical - doing what one pleases, even if it means taking the more hurtful path, just because you want to. The beauty of the film, then lies in its ability to move back and forth, in and out of every character's motivations. While there's no plot to boast of, the background score is perfectly layered and deep, to suit the mood of the film. While the soundtrack of the film is largely minimal and soothing, using artists like Jem, Lisa Hannigan and The Smiths, 'The Blower's Daughter' with its signature line, ""I can't take my eyes off of you"" becomes like an anthem for the movie. Because at the end of it, every connection, every bit of complexity, every infidel association and every emotion is derived from a basic bottom-line of instinct. It's as simple and strong as not being able to take your eyes off someone - whether you want to or not.The DVD of Closer has an interview with the director Mike Nichols, while he talks about his motivations to adapt the film from a 1997 play of the same name. It also includes a theatrical trailer and a music video of Damien Rice's 'Blower's Daughter'. In a way, Closer is a lot like Alice's personal character. It's a film just because - no reasons are given for the decisions and actions that the characters take. No analyses about what their actions define about themselves, because life isn't that easy. It's an impulsive film, one that endorses multiplicity in many forms - relationships, thought and structure. But with a disclaimer. ]"
449,"[What would you do if you got stuck in a box? And no, I am not trying to revive the melo-dramatic scene from Guzaarish, where Hrithik Roshan tries to explain to someone the metaphorical sense of being helpless. This is about literally being stuck in a box where you just about fit. It's dark, cold, dirty and you have no idea how you ended up there. Ryan Reynolds in Buried spends 95 mins in a box - buried alive and trying desperately to figure out a way to get out.Be warned, this is not a film meant for the claustrophobic. I started watching the movie with my fan switched off and with a light sweatshirt. When I was done, I was so tense, my room felt like an oven even with the fan on. My bed felt too small and I had to compulsively walk around to remind myself that there was space around me. And I'm not even claustrophobic. Ryan Renolds as Paul Conroy plays a truck driver based in Iraq who wakes up buried in a coffin. How he ends up in this coffin, he's unaware. All he remembers is being hit in the head, and waking up in pitch darkness in a box just as big as his dimensions. The first 5 mins of the film are dark. You can't see anything; you can only hear heavy breathing and uncontrollable fidgeting. More than once, I fought the urge to forward the film to a point where I could see something. Even after Reynolds brings some light in with a zippo lighter, it's flickering and troubled. You're so frustrated by now you just feel like pulling him out of the screen and bringing him into your room! We learn the box has been equipped with a phone so that the kidnappers can make contact with him and demand a ransom. This disturbing introduction is followed by frantic calls to his loved ones, the FBI, 911 in America - all of whom make him hold, take their own time to comprehend his situation. The more frustrated you get, the more Buried pulls your strings. Just when you are hopeful he might find his way out, something goes wrong. The sense of fear has been interpreted superbly by director Rodrigo Cortes and writer Chris Sparling. How much can one work around the idea of a man stuck in a box, anyway?You never once feel the sense of being stuck, ironically. Buried allows you to keep hoping whatever Conroy is planning will work out. You go through the drill of being spooked out, but even as he speaks with various people on the phone, kicks, screams and cries, something always keeps you hopeful that he will get out - it's a gripping series of events. Not much innovation could be brought into the photography and yet the lighting is minimalistic but effective. The extreme close-ups of half an eye and a stubble-beard give the exact sense of the lack of space in the frame. Ryan Reynolds plays his part as a helpless person caught in a messy political situation. Why him, we ask? How is he relevant and what will anybody gain by burying an insignificant truck driver? It's these questions that manage to fuel your frustration as a viewer. What I love the most about Buried is that no back story is offered - it's plain and simple. Paul Conroy needs to escape, and how he tries to, makes for the film. The features on the Blu-ray are rather brief but informative. We learn the film used 7 coffins to shoot, where coffins had one side opened. Director Rodrigo Cortes mentions the filming was difficult but was shot in 17 days. There are no deleted scenes, or a commentary on the filming process but the interview with the director pretty much gives you insight into the making.As an afterthought, Buried could have been crisper. It does tend to get repetitive in some bits, what with melodramatic reactions on Renolds' part. But for sheer courage to make a film like this is 17 days and to be able to spook a viewer to an extent that fast-forwarding becomes an option, Buried is a must-watch. However, please remember to catch your breath every now and then. ]"
450,"[Blood Money reminded me of this incident in school from when I was about 14 years old. We were asked to write an autobiography of a soldier in Marathi. After about 6 pages of turmoil that my soldier went through as prisoner of war, he was suddenly set free because ""The enemy got bored and frustrated with my silence."" The teacher asked me, ""Did the enemy get bored or you got bored of writing?"" That's my question for Blood Money's writer Upendra Sidhaye.After an intense and effective opening sequence, Blood Money falls into the regular zone of 'whatever' - things like, a fresh MBA gets a huge bungalow as a perk in South Africa; a not-so-warm bosses give a settling-in allowance. We have learnt to get over such discrepancies real quick. Especially since, soon enough, you have the wife not only have doubts about their good fortune but voice them too. Not too often do such logical things happen in Hindi films - a husband and wife who talk to each other about their insecurities. That's when I started getting pulled in, despite the annoyingly distracting inane songs. A little surprisingly too, I must add. I didn't expect a film with Kunal Khemu and Amrita Puri to get my complete attention for even a bit. In fact, after a while, I noticed that I had forgotten all about taking notes and just wanted to watch what's going on. The one business deal shown in detail to express Kunal's (Kunal Khemu) aptitude, the way an honest man can get sucked into the unethical because of his ambition, the way he begins justifying his lapses with some excuse or the other. Kunal Khemu does a fine job too of showing both his ambition and disappointment with himself. The audience understands and empathizes with him as they see that his dilemma never leaves him. You see when he's wrong too, but you know he just might mend his ways. The rest of the cast though, are as superficial as can be. While the feminists can be disgusted with the portrayal of a housewife abroad, I liked the way she was shown dependent on her husband in all ways but was the only support he could have is in the strange land. Amrita Puri, though not quite the mannequin she is imagined as in one of the scenes, is not the most emotive either. When her character, Arzoo did have the chance to not sulk, Amrita ended up over-enacting. The only reason Manish Chaudhary caused any scare that a villain ought to, was because of the opening sequence. His stiff dialogue delivery take away from the character, including the said scenes itself. Not to mention the annoying pet word assigned to him. They killed my theory that a pet word/phrase given to a character could work if it were short and from everyday language. Oh well. And yet, I enjoyed how these three characters were written. All of them had a shade of gray, even the villain, Zaveri/Zakaria. He too gave people a chance before deciding that they needed to be put away. The handful other characters though added nothing to the plot. From Zaveri Jr. (Sandiip Sikcand) to Sean (Teeshay) to Nandini (Name?) to to the cop (Karan Mehra) - all seemed mere pawns for the writer to go from point A to point B in the film. While Sandiip and Nandini overacted, thus were annoying, Teeshay and Karan Mehra might have shown us their talent if they had something more to dig their heels into. That brings me to the last half hour of the film. The part where the writers got bored with their job. From a calm potential for brilliant mind games between two intelligent people, it suddenly becomes an action film. It suddenly becomes a thriller. It suddenly gives birth to twists and turns. It immediately becomes material you'll laugh at. It's not that the twists were all bad. But it happens way too fast. I wonder how it'd work out if the same events played out in the even pace that the film ran with thus far. Oh well, that'd be another film. It's always a great feeling to get pulled into enjoying a film that you had very little hope from. But, it is equally bad when the film takes you down with it in a spiral of preposterous  stupidity. Then, you don't know whether to laugh at the makers or yourself for allowing yourself hope. Yet, Blood Money is watchable between ad breaks when it shows up on TV.]"
451,"[The King &amp; The Commissioner is a hard film to critique. While there is very little in the film worthy of a mention, almost of all of its flaws are pounded to a pulp by its two superstar leads - Mammootty and Suresh Gopi. But then let's face it - that is pretty much what they do best - pound things to a pulp, with punches or with punch lines.The pair reprise earlier hit characters from separate films of theirs, only this time, they are brought together in the interest of the nation (and the producers of the film, no doubt.) Still brash, still arrogant and still stylish, Mammootty's Joseph Alex is now a top bureaucrat. He has been put on a special mission by the Prime Minister of India (played by our very own Mohan Agashe) and is to be aided in his cause by none other than Bharathchandran, played by Suresh Gopi - now on 'Special Assignment' and yes, still brash, still arrogant and if possible, even more stylish.There is absolutely no denying that nearly everything is wrong with this film. Right from the opening reels of the film where Pakistanis with Malayali accents reveal their goal of terrorizing India, the film's treatment and screenplay is all over the place. It is one of those bits of writing where it seems like a lot is happening, when very little is - too many caricature-ish characters, too much talk, but very little meat. Sinfully long at nearly three-and-a-quarter hours, it can be an extremely exhausting film to watch. Far too verbose for its own good, its woes are compounded with a host of unnecessary scenes and subplots that pepper proceedings right till the very end. The film should ideally (and could easily) have been about two hours long. The other big problem with the film is the technical aspect. Insanely over-shot and over-cut, this is the kind of film whose shot breakdown I'd die to get my hands on and whose editor I'd love to have a private chat with. It would be extremely enlightening to know exactly how he came up with the idea for those umpteen cuts where the screen is split into ways that would make a butcher feel terribly low about himself.Far more serious is the way in which names have been taken in this film. Pakistan is clearly the villain, with no attempt at being mellow towards them for the sake of diplomacy in the real world. If the promos of Agent Vinod got them riled up enough to ban it, this film could severely hamper Indo-Pak ties for good if they ever happened to chance upon it. Not to mention some vicious attacks on a few public figures who've been in the news in the recent past. This film has clearly been made to play to the galleries, which is a pity. The makers had two megastars who would have set the cash registers jingling in any case. They could have used this golden opportunity to make a film that was topical, relevant and engaging without resorting to needless sensationalism.But then, when the two stars are on screen, really, all else pales. The two are clearly in their zones in this film. They thunderously deliver the over-the-top lines with ease, often making you forget how unnecessary the lines actually were in the first place. Yes, both well past 50 and both have paunches.  The remarkable thing however is that they don't look ungainly in action sequences at all. Suresh Gopi, in particular, looks extremely at ease decimating a dozen baddies without breaking a sweat. The two of them also have the phenomenal ability to make others in the frame look good, no matter how silly they otherwise are. Their presence radiates and enhances people around them, even if the people are mediocre by themselves. Nothing, really, can take away from the fact that these two fine National Award-winning actors are as much at ease playing these over-the-top commercial characters as they are playing real characters in sensible and sensitive stories.The King &amp; The Commissioner as a film is a lot like some of the action scenes in it - two towering personalities standing in a sea of mediocrity. It is the kind of film that I would recommend only to those who would not need any recommendation to watch it at all - they would have watched it any way. For others, particularly for those who like to believe that they are above all the shenanigans that big stars in big films indulge in, I'd recommend settling in with a nice, quiet book instead.]"
452,"[How often have you seen the Indian audience bank their hopes on the director instead of the stars? From my parents to my readers, the voices have turned excited as soon as they realized Agent Vinod is by the Johnny Gaddar guy. And it's not like the stars Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor are disliked or scoffed at. Hence, you resist the disappointment with the director/writer as you jeer, mock-cheer, tch-tch-tch and ultimately slap your forehead in despair as Agent Vinod progresses towards regression. You can sense director, Sriram Raghavan's discomfort with the extra money - just like a person who is uneasy among hoity-toity, snotty people, would be at a page-3 event. For all you know,  Raghavan's original story, like his earlier ones, might have been set between Mumbai, Pune, Goa and Delhi. But, well, what would he do with all the extra money? So, let's make the RDX into a nuclear bomb and voila, you have Morrocco, London, the works. We still have money left. Hmmm...songs, let's do songs. A lavish 'mujra' and a scintillating mix of color and light in a Gothic set should do the trick. Sure, you could call it the pressures of commercializing a product. But, I'd like to give  Raghavan a little more credit than that. I think he's smart enough to know that he doesn't need to commercialize his product. He is the brand. But, oh well. Who said an intelligent person has to be confident about handling money?The sign that things might not be all right show from the first sequence. A quote from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly cuts into a scene which feels like it is right out of that film. Is it a spoof? Is it a tribute? No, it's a desert in Afghanistan. Should you smile at the reference, should you engage with a tortured RAW agent? Thankfully, this is soon followed by a slickly choreographed action sequence. But the confused genres show up again before you can feel reassured that you have some mind-blowing action to look forward to. Like any half-decent thriller, Agent Vinod fools you, leads you on, makes you feel smart about yourself by having characters smile that weird smile which tells you they are upto something, throws in your face a tattoo or a musical instrument-cum-weapon you ought to remember. But at each juncture, Agent Vinod leaves a loophole waiting to be answered. Whatever made sense, left the house at interval. The last 30 minutes feels like another film that started after the first one had the most ridiculous finish. The climax of this climax made me angry. Did they even realize what they were implying an agent from India's intelligence agency did?! People who know nothing about national security would come up with a solution like this after being a few drinks down. That besides and saving a few wise-cracks, the writing had way too many distractions, be it story, screenplay or characters. For example, with every film referenced, from Don to the original Agent Vinod to Charlie Chaplin, you are taken away from the mystery Agent Vinod is trying to solve. So eager is Sriram Raghavan to make his reverent tributes that he didn't realize how they are deviating from the genre. (Oh, how I'd loved the way he paid his respect to Anand in Johnny Gaddar!)Then, throughout the film, characters are introduced either to be killed or they turn out to be an undercover terrorist/agent. I'd love for a psychoanalyst to analyze Agent Vinod (Saif Ali Khan) - he's confused about a childhood memory; he switches between being an aware human with a gut-feeling and an insensitive man's man. But then, that would mean the psychoanalyst and I would be spending more time on the character than the writers. Similarly, Irma (Kareena Kapoor) is introduced as a doctor who is an aide to a terrorist but takes refuge as soon as she sees a capable man around. The way she became a pitiable woman at the drop of a hat, there was an instant when I doubted myself. I wondered whether I'd misunderstood that she was supposed to be either an international agent or a terrorist. The chemistry between the Agent Vinod and Irma was dropped down to pillow talk between Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor. No people, no need to get excited. It's the kind of pillow talk that can put you to bed. No single character has a stay long enough to make an impact or engage except for Adil Hussain who had an elegant terror about him. Ravi Kissen and Ram Kapoor had fun-type quirky characters, while Prem Chopra was an annoying caricature. For the kind of terrorist he is proposed to be, he seemed weirdly compliant. Others like B P Singh and Mariyam had too annoying an accent and delivery style to consider anything else. And there are a few blink-and-miss cameos too.I realize that I'm tipping heavy on the story and characterization in an action film. But that has a lot to with this being a Sriram Raghavan product. I know he has a smart style of narrating his story, but what troubles me is that this is like any other action film, especially since you have a wide range of Hollywood franchises to choose from. Also, somehow when Agent Vinod does it, it doesn't look as real as a Bond, Hunt or Bourne. It might have to do with the impression that MI6 is more capable than RAW. Throughout the film, I marveled at the different sound that the film had and how my feet tapped to the background score continuously. But, did it add to the story's character? It felt like the background music was on a different trip altogether. Similarly, sure, the camerawork, editing and some of the action sequences were state-of-art but they seemed like a different department not necessarily congruent with the story. Parts added together, certainly. But did they make the film whole?Again, the songs, 'Raabta' did a 'khoya khoya chand' from Shaitan. And I can't thank the decision-makers enough for not having 'Pungi' as a part of the film, but I'd have liked to say nicer things about what they did do rather than what they didn't. ]"
453,"[Romantic-Action-Comedy to me only sounded like a mash. So when I heard, that was genre of McG's next film (director of the Charlie's Angels series) This Means War, I was worried. Two things could have happened here: this film could go the same way that most frivolous films go with really good actors. Case in point: No Strings Attached with Natalie Portman right after Black Swan. Nobody can really deduce why serious actors chose to make this genre jump. Or one could also expect actors like Reese Witherspoon and Tom Hardy to salvage the film.This Means War has an aftertaste of the Charlie's Angels films and a bit of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy are CIA agents (and best friends) who happen to fall for the same girl, Lauren (Witherspoon).Let's ignore for a moment that  Pine and  Hardy look nothing like CIA agents, what with male-model type looks and the swanky apartments they live in. As compensation you'd expect some distracting entertainment on their part. But apart from a sprinkling of witty banter, every bit of one-upmanship that they indulge in is borderline creepy and voyeuristic because of the way it's done - unlike the secretive and swift demeanor in which CIA agents act (or what popular culture would have us believe. However, the film does pick up pace in bits, picking comic elements in their fight for love and the leading men are rather adorable in their ""May the best spy win"" rut.Lauren ofcourse, is unaware and rather cute in a regular Reese Witherspoon way (see: Legally Blonde). You would think since she's done many rom-coms, Witherspoon would be able to breeze through this role, but for some reason all three actors perform extremely laboriously. The worst of the lot is Tom Hardy, who is a bad casting option for this film. I found myself regularly zoning out, and making callous references to his better films (Warrior, Inception). The film also has a real villain, Heinrich (Til Schweiger), who seems rather inconsequential in the larger scheme of things. The film categorically revolves around a glorifying set of sequences where Pine and Hardy fight it out for the lady. The action sequences are loud, and by virtue of that it does catch your attention. But in retrospect, they are also very plain and rely on the sound design to jolt you as opposed to the visuals. Having offered a critique though, I think it's only fair to inform you that the kids who had come to watch the movie were having a ball. Evidently the humor in the film was relatable to them and there were moments when, due to sheer peer pressure, I did laugh out loud. There are some funny moments and punch dialogues (and really, that much can be expected with a bunch of good actors in the film). This Means War is not as sassy and fun as the first Charlie's Angels movie was, but it's not a waste of your time either. You might just enjoy yourself. ]"
454,"[A 'Materialism versus idealistic simplicity' theme runs heavily through Jannat. So, who wins? If only it were that easy to answer. Such a deep philosophical question cannot be answered in 2.5 hours, and isn't answered either. So, if you are looking for a conclusion, a closure, Jannat is not for you. I'm sure you could easily replace the cricket-match-fixing backdrop with any dishonest activity and arrive at the same result. But, cricket feels fresh and the season is right, so why not? The dialogues spiced up with references to retired cricketers and some cricketing events in the recent past are good enough to keep you interested too. The climax of the movie reminded me of a 5-6 pages long, Marathi essay I had written in school - ""An autobiography of a soldier"". In the end, my soldier who was taken in as a prisoner of war was released because the enemy got bored of him and his silence. My teacher appreciated the writing style but made a concluding remark, ""did the enemy get bored, or did you get bored of writing?"" I only smiled sheepishly at getting caught. Something similar seems to have happened with the writer here. A nicely developed plot got shot in the middle, absolutely abruptly. Like many other movies out of the Bhatt camp, Jannat revolves around the romance between the lead pair. I really enjoy the way their relationship builds and the tumult it goes through. Important moments are given space and time to develop. There is a certain human element in these movies that clicks and you can sense the expected chemistry.Emraan Hashmi's (Arjun) acting has begun growing on me over the last few movies. So much so that the unidentifiable thing about his looks that used to irritate me, does so a little less now. A fearless gambler who can woo and romance his lady love with the right dosage of style - all this falls flat when he is required to cry. Same goes for the pretty looking Sonal Chauhan's (Zoya's) performance too. What I can't come to terms with however, are the shabby performances by the supporting cast, except maybe Samir Kochchar (Inspector/CBI official). Everyone else, from Javed Shaikh (Don in South Africa) to Vipin Sharma (Arjun's dad - isn't he getting tired of playing the dissatisfied dad, already?!), seem superficial and are just reading out their lines. There was no way to judge how well Arjun's friend was performing, because the bad dubbing was extremely distracting.On the other hand, the tight close-ups worked really well, because they were used rarely when the facial expressions were important enough to deserve exclusive attention. I also particularly liked the use of handheld camera just for Arjun. in the scene just before the interval - sort-of hinting that his life might not be as good as it seems after all. Otherwise the calm camera movements have a soothing effect. Like the softness in the narrative had a Vishesh Films stamp on it, the music had Pritam written all over it. In general, I enjoy this kind of music and enjoyed it as much as the other Bhatt-Pritam combinations that have been churned out earlier. Now, that it is him plagiarizing himself, who had earlier plagiarized some one else, is a different matter all together. And I didn't particularly like the way the title song was picturized though - a tad too artificial to go with the rest of the film.There isn't too much that I didn't like about the movie, but yet, it leaves only an okay-ish feeling while walking out of the cinema hall. Can't really point a finger at what went wrong other than the scenes in which people were crying and weren't very good at it. It might seem a wee bit longer than it needed to be, but that is not really the reason for me to be harsh. So, as always, I'm just going to stick to the feeling I came out with.]"
455,"[Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams look pretty darn good together. He's handsome and manly, she's petite and cute. You've won your battle by casting right in a romantic film - where the aim is for the audience to feel the love. It makes the job easier when the lead actors make a good looking pair. The Vow then is a love story between two fairly young individuals who find themselves in a bit of a spot. Everything seems romantically blissful for the newlyweds, Leo and Paige. They seem merrily in love, and their little parade of glee gets cut short when Paige loses her memory in a car accident. She doesn't remember anything that happened in the last 5 years.On her part, McAdams does the whole confused bit pretty convincingly. Tatum is madly in love with his wife and through regular flashbacks we see the wonderfully romantic things he does for her - and you want to yank her out of her memory loss. But here's the movie's biggest problem: nothing is strong enough. The love becomes corny every now and then, no emotion (be it the horror of a memory loss, the frustration of a husband sharing an apartment with his stranger wife and so on) is established strong enough. Halfway through any portrayal, you already want to move onto to the main question the film poses: will she regain her memory?The Vow is based on a real-life incident involving Kim and Krickitt Carpenter, but it doesn't really grip enough. The first few minutes of the film looks wonderfully bohemian, when we see Leo and Paige's life. Her art studio with abstract clay cut outs, their apartment filled with color coordinated furniture in different shapes. But really, if that's the one thing I remember warming my heart, the real hero of this film is production designer Kalina Ivanov.Unlike similarly plotted film, 50 First Dates, this film doesn't have a comedy streak to fall back on. Or a goofy Adam Sandler. It could have been a fairly gripping film, with an interesting plot, if it steered clear of the regular cliche: love conquers all. Treated differently, perhaps the film could have focused on how Leo strives to make her fall back in love with him. On the contrary, The Vow leaves much to chance for the lead pair to realize their feelings for one another. Sure, it's a well-behaved clean average film. If you're in the mood for a cheesy weekend flick, The Vow delivers promptly. It could have been a crisp film; free from melodrama had the dialogues been given more attention, but with a good looking lead pair and a regular dose of love, this is your run-off-the-mill romance movie. If you're into it, it gives you exactly what you want. ]"
456,"[In a particularly irrelevant scene in Chinu where some men sit down over drinks, a particularly irrelevant side character in the film sees a Little Person and begins humming a famous and relevant  tune from an old cult Tamil film (which also saw success as a Hindi dub). That was perhaps the only moment where the makers of the film displayed at least some semblance of insight, interest and understanding of what they could do to make their film the least bit watchable.Chinu is a spunky and pretty village belle who displays no interest in getting married to any of the boys in her village. So much so that even the village head intervenes, trying to convince her to pick a boy and settle down. But 'nothing doing' for her, because she wants her aging mother to be taken care of and her younger brother with a mysterious psychological illness to be cured and to then be educated. Thus, she dreams of getting married to a city-bred man - something that is taboo in their village.As luck would have it, Sampath, a man from their village who now lives in the city shows interest in her. From here on things go southwards - for her as well as for the film. Chinu, directed by Neelima Lonari is essentially a 'nothing' film. With a script that is all over the place and with possibly the worst ensemble cast in recent times, the film drags along with neither aim nor direction towards a terrible, inane climax. Lead actress Tejaswini Lonari, who plays Chinu, is beautiful in a rather unconventional way. In fleeting moments, she showed flashes of being like - dare I say it - a semi-rustic Smita Patil. She tries hard, but never really manages to pump in enough credibility into her portrayal of the character. One of India's better actors, Zakir Hussain, is wasted in an insignificant role. Popular Hindi soap actor Sharad Kelkar is the only other cast member who shows at least a hint of ability.The film's biggest problem is that it has been treated rather amateurishly. It often seems like an ambitious and lengthy student film, made more to practice track-and-trolley and crane movements than to make a serious piece of cinema. As a result, even its under-2-hour runtime seems so much longer than it actually is. It goes without saying that Chinu is a film best avoided. Perhaps the only benefactor (if I can even use the word) from this film is BlackBerry. Every single character who owns a phone in the film uses RIM's business class phone. There is perhaps no bigger sign of the famous decline of the once-popular Canadian phone manufacturer than the fact that they had to settle for this film for such intensive product placement.]"
457,"[Kahaani is a film that I'd just urge you to watch. You want to watch it for the story, you want to watch it for the character BVidya, you want to watch it for the actor Vidya.Yes, it means I want you to drop reading this review and begin booking your tickets in the next window. Not only because Kahaani is a 'must watch', but more because I fear I might spill the beans. Any word I say (or not say) might give the film away and I'd feel extreme regret if I was instrumental in giving anything away that the makers have so beautifully guarded. Thus far. But Vidya Balan is something we CAN talk about. The lady just makes it difficult for you to pick a favorite from amongst her films. She just adds on to the list. Her character's vulnerability is indistinguishable from whatever the actor might have felt. So stressed is the pregnant Vidya while looking for her husband, that you want her to relax while saying, ""orre orre, shaant-shaant, nai to baby ho jobe"" (""relax else you might deliver"" in whatever broken Bangla I know). And this is in the first ten minutes of the film. Your emotions towards her get only more sensitive as the film progresses.For a thriller that solely rests on the shoulders of a woman character, Kahaani does a brilliant job of exposing just that little amount of material to both move the story forward and to keep you interested. It teases you, the seasoned thriller viewer, along the way too. But mostly by hook and sometimes by crook, it keeps you wanting to crack the puzzle. The smart writing took me as a viewer through a roller coaster ride in just one moment. A moment, a twist when I felt cheated. You know, how you engage in a thriller and you want to feel smart about yourself by deciphering the mystery from the material given to you. And then the writers pull something out from thin air and you are left sulking and feeling deceived. Kahaani has that one moment, but soon enough it recovers. It gives you enough justification that you don't feel like that big a fool after all. Sorry, but saying anything more would be unfair to the makers. In fact, merely naming the genre of the film is giving away a little more than the makers intended to, if the trailers are anything to go by. Interestingly then, while the editing and the background music stay true to the edgy theme, the pace of the story never gets too quick to disconcert. Similarly, the rugged, sordid texture of the film isn't something you'd associate with a thriller. Even more interestingly, the mismatch is either not noticeable at first watch or it doesn't seem to distract. You end up enjoying Clinton Cerejo's background score as you pick up R. D. Burman's popular songs from yesteryears, some of them in Bangla. In equal measure, you notice the quirky editing especially in the first 10 minutes - they'll put to rest any doubts you might have about the genre. Speaking of genres, Kahaani produces one moment of romance that entire 2-hour films dedicated to the genre aren't able to create at most times. Same goes for the couple of times it makes you laugh too. The rare humor blends in very well given the serious topic at hand. Kahaani also has a couple of insightful moments where comments are passed on the prevalent system and you wonder at their truthfulness, righteousness, politically correctness and the debate they open the subject up to. It might sound like Kahaani has it all tragedy, comedy, drama, romance. And it does. Not to mention one of the few times (first?), a mainstream Hindi film's camera has romanced Calcutta. But, it's all gentle and fluid. You are looking at it throughout the two hours and yet you don't realize it.]"
458,"[Chaar Din Ki Chandni is one of the films that make you wonder 'Why did they bother?' or at least 'Why did you bother watching it?' Exasperating and as repeatedly pointed out by Anupam Kher's character - loud and garish - Chaar Din Ki Chandni gets on your nerves almost from the moment the director introduces himself as the narrator, that is scene 1.And loud and garish pretty much describes each character and the over-the-top performance each actor uses to demonstrate the particular idiosyncrasy assigned to their character. From Anupam Kher, Om Puri, and Farida Jalal to Sushant Singh, Chandrachur Singh, Mukul Dev and Rahul Singh. The few exceptions are Anita Raj, Tusshar Kapoor, Kulraj Randhwa and surprisingly Johnny Lever. That doesn't mean Johnny Lever isn't loud, it just means his earsplitting voice is at least justifiable considering what his character has faced. Similarly, Tusshar Kapoor's non-loudness is only relative. And he is mildly amusing when he dons the avatar of a sardar. That just leaves Anita Raj and Kulraj Randhwa who are the only respite from this otherwise insufferable thing masquerading around as a film. The story is the ages-old one about family not approving of a partner that their son has fallen in love with. The sub-plots are contrived and stretched beyond tolerable; and kills the joke in the couple of times there could've been a decent one. Mistaken identities, blatant cover-ups, and a hundred white lies later the plot is so convoluted that you are left with no emotion to attach to the characters or the plot. What with every man in the disapproving family falling for the disapproved woman - head over heels and vulgar in turns - a la but nothing like Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Naram Garam. She of course, is brilliant at exactly the same thing that each of the four men are interested in - guns, alcohol, whatever say you. The exuberant, all-knowing woman that she is. I wonder if the latest courses in story-writing and acting have a separate chapter on the ever-spirited, boisterous yet cultured charmer of a woman that our films invariably have these days. Whether or not they have that, they surely don't have a chapter on thinking long and hard about the name you give your film. The Hindi phrase Chaar Din Ki Chandni is the first part of Chaar Din Ki Chandni, phir andheri raat which translates to 'Four days' of good times (moonlit nights), and then ensues darkness'; very much like the phrase '9 days' wonder'. The lead character is called Chandni, certainly they didn't mean what the title implies for their lead character. Or is this one of those clear cases of viewer spending more time reading into the script than the makers spent on reading it? ]"
459,"[Once during a flimsy duty-free spree I happened to catch a whiff of Chanel no. 5, also Marilyn Monroe's famously endorsed fragrance - and I knew in a second why she was chosen as brand ambassador. It was a naughty scent; a teasingly stimulating musk, one that lingered on for a couple of hours, strong yet subtle and blotches of a sweet jasmine-y smell. I could picture Monroe standing atop a platform, with her dress flying saying, ""that's how I smell, lovelies"". As I watched My Week with Marilyn, I remember those moments in the duty free section. Michelle Williams in the film, based on a book by Colin Clark is an absolute stunner. While the film might be a tad bit weak, story wise, feeling a bit repetitive and clumsy, Williams is like the bottle of Chanel no. 5. She's not the real deal; not nearly close to it (that's also because there has only been ONE Monroe), but every moment she appears on screen, you share her conviction, with which she acts out a lovely, sassy rendition of Marilyn Monroe. The film is set in 1956, and told to us from Clark's point of view. Clark (played by Eddie Redmayne) is an aspiring filmmaker, who finally gets his break as a third assistance director in the England shoot of The Prince and the Showgirl. He meets Marilyn Monroe - and much like his first time, Williams introduction as Monroe in the film, blows our minds too. She's all about charm. And of course, she's a difficult actress - always late, messing her lines, questioning the director's call and other quirks. She develops a soft corner for Clark, for his meekness and awe of her. Through their (warped) relationship -Clark's and Monroe's - we see much discussed traits of her character. Her loneliness, insecurities and brashness is shown to us from Clark's point of view. It's not a diva behavior we as audiences are alien to, we've all read quite a bit on Monroe. It's the idea that Clark as her confidant gets to see a side of hers that isn't restricted to her sultry public persona that is a big win. We see a dreamy, questioning Monroe as she confidently does what she's best at in The Prince and The showgirl. But we also see a disturbed side of hers, as she speculates and gets dangerously close to Clark through the film.There are drawbacks in My Week with Marilyn, though. First one being the script: it's repetitive and doesn't bring forward anything new. The film is extremely performance heavy; without Williams' colorfully sensual performance of Monroe the film would be quite flat. The film has some standout dialogues though. But much accolades to Williams for bringing out the camera-loving side of Monroe. It's a hard task, because Monroe had the notoriously sex-kitten face, that every single human I know has stopped to look at twice at some point in their lives. It's naughty, period. While Williams' face is a lot more simplistic and pleasing, you tend to let your mind wander every now and then.You'll notice how most of this review is about Marilyn versus Williams as her, as opposed to a review of the film. That is exactly what you move out with, once the film is over. You might not even like the film that much, as it's not a story that's adding anything new to your life or one that stays with you. Clark (Eddie Redmayne) as an infatuated boy is a natural, and a perfect catalyst to bring out the nostalgia of Marilyn Monroe.But most of all, My Week with Marilyn belongs to Michelle Williams; for sheer gut to be able to make audiences accept her ""different"" portrayal and for making us want to curse ourselves for not being born during the 50s. ]"
460,"[Ever since I saw the trailer of The Iron Lady, I couldn't imagine anyone else but Meryl Streep play Margaret Thatcher. In my head, with whatever little knowledge I had about the politician, I thought it was brilliant casting, to get someone as able as Streep to play an ambivalent character as hers. This thought stayed with me after I walked out of watching the film. I struggled to place Thatcher's real face. All I could think of, was this one shot of Streep as Thatcher with her husband Denis Thatcher (played by Jim Broadbent), as they stand behind a podium, dressed in blue, with their hands held up together in victory. Streep sold me the visual picture. Using flashbacks as its main narrative device, The Iron Lady traces Thatcher's journey from an unknown British woman who went to oxford, and slowly, through the course of her marriage and twins, finds her way into politics. We whisk through her accomplishments, through a series of montages. We also periodically keep intercutting to the present day, where we see an older Thatcher, battling with dementia, as she has make-believe conversations. We are shown flashbacks of her courtship days with her husband, and archival footage of the British political past. It's a slow progression however; one that not necessarily follows a particular motif.The biggest problem with The Iron Lady is the absence of direction of the script. The film attempts to capture all of Thatcher's life in 2 hours, but as is the case with every biopic, a flavour is necessary; or what is popularly known as a peg. We are shown her involvements in major historical events (A war in Argentina, her invasion of the Falkland Islands, etc). But it goes wrong in its flat, lifeless portrayal. The graph of her political career would have been more interesting had we been shown the impact of her professional accomplishments on her psyche, her loved and mostly on her rivals. No other character has been paid attention to, while Streep gives the performance of the year. While Jim Broadbent as Dennis Thatcher is gripping, Streep is the clear show-stealer. She takes on the voice, accent, demeanor, and powerful-eyes of Thatcher - this film has nothing else going for itself. She captures the confusion and nuances of a person suffering from dementia perfectly, and you're able to sit up in awe when this is intercut with glimpses of her longstanding political career.The Iron Lady would have been a much more impactful film has the script managed to hold our interest. Instead, we end up getting confused about the tone of the film, and the message it wants to convey. It is merely a document of dull facts being played out one after another, and the use of flashbacks have not been justified. Was the Oscar worth it, is a question that this film cannot answer. Streep has given a powerful performance, but because the film doesn't bind it together - I personally prefer her in The Devil Wears Prada. Watch The Iron Lady for Meryl Streep alone, though if you miss this one, you won't really be missing anything. ]"
461,"[No Strings Attached is an expression for a casual relationship between Adam and Emma with some established ground rules - no attachments, no jealously, no lying, no flowers. Life is fun until they start to actually enjoy time with each other. It answers the 'not so mind-blowing question' - can they stay without falling in love?The characters have been played very well, both by Ashton Kutcher (Adam) and Natalie Portman (Emma). I thought Portman was a very serious actor. But she pulls off a girl next door role (and a tough one at that) in this film very well. After seeing her play something so intense, something so critical in Black Swan, it is a pleasant surprise to see her play a part so simple and regular where she smiles to the fullest and dreams like any other girl. Emma is busy pursuing a medical career and wants to live a life without any liabilities. She doesn't want to get into a relationship that demands too much time or emotional energy. In a couple of places, though, she blew the emotion off completely. But given her acting capabilities, I'll blame the direction for it. Kutcher, on the other hand, is the same that he was in almost all his romantic films. I absolutely love his part as Kelso (That 70's Show rocks, man!), and therefore it feels unnatural to see Kutcher act so normal. He somehow flows really well into a handsome guy, who is charming, with a good sense of humor, who lives life to the fullest, and doesn't expect much from anybody. These guys get together, and obviously... life happens. The story goes from fast and unsurprising in the first half to slow and unsurprising in the second, and yet isn't all that boring. . The film lies somewhere between a chick flick and a rom-com. Though the dialogues are funny, many of them are in the trailer. Of course, it is predictable to the last dialogue, but there is always the chance that you notice things other than the story. For example the architecture of Adam's house, the beautiful dress that Portman wears for her date, the funny period mix that Adam makes for Emma. All the supporting characters did fairly convincible jobs and deserve praise too. I especially liked Lake Bell, who plays Adam's colleague, strong by herself but still almost in love with him. No Strings Attached is sweet and affectionate, but not a must watch. Oh and the last bit which goes without saying - lots of suggestive romance scenes, so avoid watching with family.]"
462,"[I was rather wary of watching the fifth rom-com/romance  in four weeks. Images of Ali Zafar from Mere Brother Ki Dulhan didn't help. So, you can imagine my surprise when I started being drawn to the characters and involved in their stories within the first ten minutes or so. The cute lines, the casual build-up and the performances keep you engaged and smiling throughout. When Ali Zafar doesn't do the sigh-in-mouth dialogue delivery, he is quite the charmer. You'd fall in love with Nikhil, the character he plays, for just the way he looks at Lalitha. You don't need anything else to convince you how much he is in love with her, even when she's questioning it. His disappointment reaches out to you whenever you, with him, think that he can't have her.For now, Aditi Rao Hydari, didn't need to do anything other than just be there for me to not take my eyes off hers. Her eyes emote genuine warmth, and more generally her persona is captivating. That besides she carried both the regular girl-next-door, disheveled-hair look and the sizzling Parisian style with equal ease.And there is nothing more to London Paris New York. Just Nikhil and Lalitha. The usual cinematography of these cities have ceased to impress me to the extent that I might not be in awe of the Eiffel Tower/Statue of Liberty or the London bridge when I see them the next time. Nikhil and Lalitha though, being shown their way by Ali Zafar and Aditi Rao Hydari are delightful. Their chemistry is riveting and goes beyond every time they come within a foot's distance of each other. Even otherwise, it was fun watching them hold the mirror to each other's shortcomings. Made them very human and relatable.It's only a bummer then, that they chose the regular route to end the film - long-winded, unimaginative, disappointing and thus unforgivable. When the film broke for half-time, I could hear surprised sounds from the audience, many of us didn't realize how 45-50 minutes of the film had passed by. Even post-interval there were some well-composed sequences that made me worry about how little time the film had to wrap itself up. That is ALWAYS a sign of a film made well. Thus far.No matter how many films I see suffer from the first-half-second-half syndrome, often after seeing a good first half, I find myself forgetting at interval that it could still go downhill. The last ten or so minutes of London Paris New York rudely reminded me of that common pitfall. But thankfully, the film is short enough that the good parts are impactful enough to overcome a part of the disastrous last ten minutes.]"
463,"[Paan Singh Tomaris the angst of an athlete who did the right thing and tried his best to work within the system to get justice for himself and his family. But then he was pushed. Pushed beyond his limits. And then he turned into a revolutionary, what we call a dacoit. The irony, that he got more recognition as a dacoit than a sportsperson representing his country in international events, never stopped to boggle him. Does it bother us though? Then, why hasn't the situation changed in the last 40-50 years?Even now, the plight wouldn't have reached us if it were not for Irrfan Khan who plays Paan Singh Tomar. He completely bowls us over with his simplicity and then, frustrated aggression. Moreover, after Paan Singh turns into a dacoit rebel, the pride of a military personnel and a national-level sportsperson never leaves his eyes. He is very rooted in his cause and yet reminds you where his heart lies, time and again. Mahie Gill provides wonderful support by showing us why she is Paan Singh's vulnerability. And this must be that rare film when a character who plays a prominent part in the first half of the film disappears later and the disappearance seems justified. Paan Singh had to forgo his family life including his wife, after all.Paan Singh Tomar invokes your curiosity by exposing the rebel Paan Singh before telling us about how he was as a sportsperson. That created just the right amount intrigue because as the flashback progressed you wanted to know how this simple, straightforward person took to becoming a dacoit. Paan Singh's achievements as an athlete is shown in good detail and so is his transformation into a person who had to take the law in his hands. The part where he becomes feared and successful as a dacoit is sorely missing. And that according to me is the film's biggest letdown. The meek and largely submissive Paan Singh suddenly becomes a dreaded outlaw and we are asked to take that as a given. And despite this major gap in the writing, Paan Singh Tomar is commendable and recommended watch because of the issue it tries to address. If there is one thing about sports in our nation that needs dire attention, it is the condition of and apathy towards our non-cricketing sportspeople.]"
464,"[The fact that the last film I saw before Matter on the big screen was Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, has nothing to do with what I eventually felt about Matter. A film so poorly written that even school plays parodying 'Indian Idol' seem better, Matter is the kind of film that, apart from doing nothing for the cause of Marathi cinema, may also have ended up having an adverse effect on the mind of that young boy who was sitting with his parents in the last row of the screen where I saw the film. He will probably grow up not believing in the magic of cinema.Three young kids growing up in a rough neighborhood in Mumbai commit a murder to avenge the rape of the sister of one of them. They are sent to a juvenile delinquent home for reformation, where they become friends with another young kid, Ronnie. Together, the four of them grow up to become the main leads of the film, four wastrels who can't find decent work because they are branded as criminals or bhais because of one mistake in their childhood. Their solution? ""A bad name is better than no name, so let us just become actual bhais instead."" And thus begins a torturous couple of hours comprising primarily of guns, girls and gaalis (profanity) (or whatever they could get through the censors). Riddled with showboating technical gimmickry, including crass transitions and unnecessary camera movements, Matter has almost nothing right with it. The screenplay is so poorly written that I can't even use my favourite phrase, 'lost the plot' to describe it, simply because they never had a plot in the first place. A host of mindless characters, situations, scenes, songs and twists pepper proceedings until the merciful end, something that I have never been more grateful for.To be fair, the four male leads, played by Santosh Juvekar, Jitendra Joshi, Rajesh Shringapure and Sushant Shelar, share a decent camaraderie. The best scenes of the film are invariably those where the four of them are needling one another. Acting is clearly in the blood of not one of them, but they are all endearing in a goofy way. It is when they decide that they want to 'rule' Mumbai that they end up looking like the clowns that they are.And then of course, there is Sameer Dharmadhikari playing bad-ass cop Vikram Pradhan, who believes that 'Mumbai saaf toh sau gunhe maaf'. (If Mumbai is clean, then all crimes are forgiven) He leads a pack of caricature-ish side characters including Muslim dons in South Mumbai and an unscrupulous female politician who shelters the underworld. The film meanders along aimlessly without a message or a story with a very clear single point agenda - 'let us make a cool film on the Mumbai underworld', an agenda which it miserably fails at.Clearly, someone who held the keys to the safe saw the disaster that was in the making midway through, because what starts off looking like a film with a certain level of production value eventually descends into a mess of digitally shot, poorly colour-corrected footage put together to complete the film.Matter is a film best avoided, one that children in particular must definitely be kept away from. ]"
465,"[Roman Polanski's latest offering, Carnage, based on a play by Yasmina Reza, is a unique film. Unique, because unlike almost every other film that has ever been made, the entire film (apart from the opening and closing credits) plays out in real time. So, the 80 minutes that you spend in the cinema equals the 80 minutes that the stellar cast spend with each other in the film. What makes Carnage such a delight are the sharp dialogues, delivered finely that together will plaster a silly smirk on your face through the film, provided you pay attention.A perfectly innocuous (if a little violent) fight between two kids in a New York neighborhood is escalated to their parents. The parents being, well, 'parents', attempt to resolve the issue in a more 'mature' manner, trying to talk it out between themselves. So, the Longstreets, played by Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly call the Cowans (Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz) over to their home.Over coffee, cobbler and eventually, scotch, all facades are quite ungracefully pulled down as each couple's relationship unravels at the seams, and each character's quirks begin to surface in a rather 'dramedic' manner (if I may coin a word.)What is marvelous is the way one rarely ever feels a sense of discontinuity in the proceedings. It is hard to believe that this film was shot as a 'film' and not as a continuous one-act play in a multi-cam setup. Perhaps the only thing that really gives it away visually is the changing colour of Kate Winslet's lipstick. Over the course of the film, everything, from pseudo-political ideology to gender stereotypes, is discussed through the characters. What is interesting to note is how certain situations cause certain people to group together irrespective of how much they dislike each others' personalities. Carnage is, in that sense, a perfect study of urban human behavior. The film is made so watchable because the actors are made to pump in credibility into their parts like few ever do. Jodie Foster is incredible as the seemingly mature aspiring writer with a soft corner for the sufferers of the atrocities in Darfur. Her character has a strange graph through the film, and though she goes from being the most level-headed to being the most hyperactive within seconds, she deserves full marks for making it look natural. Even in her level-headedness, one could easily make out what exactly was bubbling under the surface. John C. Reilly as her hardware store owner husband is perhaps the weakest of the cast, but is still competent as the typical man who believes problems between men should be sorted the way 'men solve problems'.Kate Winslet plays the career woman who is forced to look into domestic problems because her husband is too indifferent towards these matters and 'expects' her to take care of it. Like Jodie Foster's character, hers also has a see-sawing graph which requires an immense understanding of the art of 'being' a character. Needless to say, Winslet excels.My personal favourite in the film is the immensely talented Christoph Waltz as the BlackBerry addict attorney who is forced to be a part of the proceedings because he is the 'father' of one of the children involved. His BlackBerry seems to buzz at precisely the moment it shouldn't, and every single time, his response to it, though the same, is priceless. While the title Carnage makes it sound more like an ""I'm Duke Nukem, I'm gonna blast the beep out of your beep"" film, the carnage here is more metaphysical. A classic character study, it is insightful, quirky and immensely entertaining. Though not necessarily a big screen watch in terms of visuals, Carnage is a film ideally enjoyed in a crowd. It is a real pity that the crowds are clearly not flocking to the theatres for this one.]"
466,"[It's a bit overwhelming to write a review of a film that has won 3 Academy awards barely 4 hours ago. Every person around me is throwing their opinions on The Artist - ""Did it deserve 3 awards?"" ""How it's preposterous that so-and-so did not watch the film over the weekend."" ""How it's actually an overrated rom-com"" and the likes. While the Academy awards usually bring about healthy debates post its early morning broadcast, this year The Artist has been favored by most. Allow me to reason out why. The Artist is set during the mid-1920s. The plot seems adapted from films like Sunset Boulevard and Singin' in the Rain (which talks about the rise and fall of a silent superstar with the introduction of the talkies), but where the The Artist stands out is in its lead pair's ability to convince you that you're actually back in the day. Not once does it give you the feeling of watching a homage film and primarily for that, The Artist holds your complete attention in its first 5 minutes. Jean Dujardin plays George Valentin, a famous silent star with the charming smile. It's one of those pre-requisites that the lead actors walked around with: a charming smile, a thin mustache, a tap-dancing ability and you're good to go. In Valentin's case, he also has a pet dog, Uggy, who remains faithful to him till the last breath of the film (admittedly also my favorite character in the film, as he reminds me so much of Odie from the Garfield series). Anyhow, Valentin bumps into Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) at a movie and they have a moment. What follows reminds me severely of a scene in The Social NetworkThe Social Network, Eduardo mentions how Sean Parker made his biggest contribution to Facebook by excluding the 'The'. Valentin in all his star wisdom adds a mole above Miller's lip with a pencil. It's this same mole that takes her places, that turns her into a superstar just when talkies have started to trend.We then see the fall of Valentin, his charming smile stands as nothing compared to the epidemic of hearing one's favorite superstar speak. Every dramatic emotion is played out beautifully with orchestrated background music - from Valentin's silent fears manifested in his dreams, to his tragic loss of fame as compared to Miller's instant shot at success. And yet, every time they both appear on screen you wonder when all troubles will come to an end, and when life will only be about the dances. Berenice Bejo is downright lovable; you can see why the audiences adore her. She appeals to all also because she's not the typical poofed-blonde-hair, curvaceous, uptight heroine (although a rarity now). Peppy Miller, on the other hand gives every woman who aspires to be a Hollywood star the permission to dream. The real winners of The Artist, then are not Dujardin and Bejo but the characters George Valentin and Peppy Miller, because together they make you fall in love with the movies. They make you forget you're being told a story that is not new, and make you concentrate on the medium that is being chosen to tell it. Together they make you believe no matter what the mode The Artist, cannot be made without a charming lead pair. Where The Artist holds a disadvantage is addressing an audience that is so used to verbosity. It does tend to drag a bit, in parts where you have managed to overcome the awe of experiencing a silent film. That is so because even in similarly plotted films, the medium is contemporary and the silent era is only being referred to and discussed. Whereas, The Artist uses the very same medium to tell its story - the 4:3 aspect ratio reminds us of noisy projectors through which the movies were screened, glow lighting that created a unreal halo around the superstar of the film and heavily orchestrated music that serves as your cue to emote. For its sheer courage and innovation then, you willingly keep debates and speculation on hold, and MUST watch The Artist on the big screen - because anything else would be a crime. But more importantly because The Artist makes you fall in love with the movies all over again. ]"
467,"[There are sports films and there are sports films. And there is Moneyball. There are sports films that show you the sport. They make you feel the adrenaline, they make you want to get up and cheer. And at the climax, when who you are rooting for wins, they give you that shiver up your spine, because victory is an emotion like no other. And then... there is Moneyball. Nearly seven years after his first feature, the beautifully acted Capote, Bennett Miller returns, this time teaming up with star screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin, to deliver a sports film, a baseball film to be precise, that is more about the underlying passion for the game than the adrenaline that goes with playing or consuming it. At the same time, it is also more about using logic to get things right in sport, instead of relying on 'perceptions' of skill and talent. Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), a former prodigal but failed baseball player himself, is now General Manager of the Oakland Athletics - a team that has been on the fringes, primarily because of their incredibly low budget compared to giants like the Boston Red Sox or the New York Mets. As a result, they are also faced with the problem of attrition - their star players invariably go along with fat pay packets to play for the big guns. A chance meeting with a Yale Economics graduate Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) convinces Beane that there is a way to put together a winning team even on a low budget. Chak De! India meets Jerry Maguire meets The Social Network, who then meet Zaillian and Sorkin, both masters of the screenplay. Moneyball takes you off the field and into the rooms where the decisions are taken. It is layered and purposeful, because that is how mental games are. Though quite long, Moneyball is still exceptionally written, with full credit to Miller for not hurrying with proceedings. Brad Pitt's character is still haunted by the ghosts of the days gone by and those long, silent scenes of him contemplating his past, present and future, his love for the game, his belief in his tactics may bore some, but if you pause the way his character has, you might just see why they are necessary. Along with the obvious developments in the team-building aspects of the film, a number of other, at times more pertinent issues are touched upon. How difficult is it to let a player 'go'? How difficult is it to be the man at the helm, the man at whom the buck stops? What do you do when you have so much at stake, but you also have in you a sense of being a jinx? And what do you really have at stake when you are a middle-aged divorcee with a daughter who hero-worships you? How much can you really put on the line? Moneyball is immersive because it is a film that transcends the obvious traps that a film on sport can fall prey to.Brad Pitt combines his natural, cocky movie-stardom with intensity, purpose and a firm sense of being, to deliver a standout (and incidentally, Academy Award-nominated) performance. Jonah Hill, better known from earlier comic roles, is cast in a dramatic role for the first time, and he does it justice - he has also been nominated for an Academy Award. He is genuinely adorable, and he holds his own in front of Pitt, a feat in itself.Moneyball is a film that Hollywood normally finds hard to make. ""A sports film without slow motion? VFX heavy on-field action shots? Bah!"" In spite of that, it is a film that would only be completely comprehendible with at least some knowledge of baseball. There is no attempt to 'explain' baseball to those who have no knowledge of it, and baseball jargon is part of the day-to-day language for the characters in the film. It is also the kind of film that will grow better with subsequent viewings, because the viewer can gently unpeel the layers in the writing and the performances. For the first viewing though, some prior reading on baseball will help immensely.]"
468,"[The moment characters in a film begin reacting to everything by yelling at the top of their voices, I'm put off. Invariably, there is insistent background music as accompaniment too. Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya hits that nail on the spot. That besides, there is nothing much going for it in terms of story or logic.Well, there is nothing logical about a strong-headed woman who has her own mind and knows what she wants not being able to avoid marriage till she finds the right guy. At that very basic level, Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya fails. But, I guess, you could give it to them, at what they were trying to do by the end. It's miraculous how the entire film seems to revolve around Minnie (Genelia D'Souza (Deshmukh(?))) and yet it ultimately is up to the man of the film, Viren (Riteish Deshmukh) to show who wears the pants. Of course, the climax is something we should have given up on, after the first time it was used in a film. But, oh well, all is fair in love, war and Bolly-com - is what the audience has to come to terms with. The only thing going for the film then, is the lead pair - Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia D'Souza. Genelia D'Souza is no doubt very pretty and one could just alternate between her glinting eyes and charming smile for a couple of hours. You'd enjoy it even more if you are not distracted by her exaggerated hand-gestures and shrill voice, like me. And if you actually like that kind of body language and dialogue delivery, I wouldn't even venture into how much it'd mean to you. But, I tire easily of over-enthusiastic characters, in real life too, and we've seen too much of those in recent times, anyway. Riteish Deshmukh on the other hand plays the perfect lad-in-distress - helpless, clueless yet surprisingly sure of what he wants in life. Yet, many a time, you just want him to act normal and see if that works for you. The rest of the cast is a loud bunch, which is why the 2-3 glimpses of subtle understanding that you see from Om Puri come as a surprise. They remind you of what he is capable of. Unfortunately, Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya is so caught up in being exuberant and funny that it does injustice to the 'message' that it wants to send. Even so, when the underlying motivation does come across, it is a pleasant surprise and you wish you had more. That was my problem with Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya. It tried too hard to keep that smile on my face. Fine, I did enjoy a few moments, but then there were others that got annoying. And, anyway, ultimately the boy-meets-girl story had no other meat in it. ]"
469,"[Jodi Breakers has the right mix of ups &amp; downs, moments - insecure &amp; 'aawww', comedy, that define a relationship. Unfortunately, it spends all its energy in just getting from one to the next which makes the whole story look functional rather than involved and connected. Similarly, the actors too look like they are keeping a one-arm distance from their characters. Except for one moment, R Madhavan looked like he was trying to justify the decision to cast him, and he looked extremely uncomfortable opposite Bipasha Basu. And this is despite the fact that he looked comfortable with his non-hero-like body and the story used it well too. One could call it a restrained performance, but Bipasha Basu, didn't look like she wanted to go too out of her way to emote. And yes, I'm one of those who believe that she can. As a natural outcome then, the 'chemistry' they were forcing themselves to invoke looked mighty unnatural. Not that there is anything very natural about the basic plot line - Sid (R Madhavan) makes a business out of separating couples who aren't getting along too well with each other. And separate them he will - by hook or crook. Therefore, having a manipulative mind is inevitable and he takes a liking to Sonali (Bipasha Basu) because she is even better at coming up with manipulative ideas to kill a relationship. When I first saw the trailer of Jodi Breakers, I assumed at least some portion of the film would be spent on how creatively the twosome break marriages apart. But, nothing of the sort, the one or two cases that are shown in a tiny bit of detail are outrageous. In fact, they aren't too creative about the type of reasons that couples want to break up either. It's either cheating or the mother-in-law. That's it. The second half of the film isn't even about the breaking-up bit. It almost is a second film with another story at its center, except that we are carrying minimal baggage from the first half. In 30+ years of watching films, I've never been able to understand how easily people fall in and out of love and how willingly some characters forgive others who have wronged them in the most unimaginable way possible. Jodi Breakers is another film that can be added to that list of question marks. But, I guess, it is expected that a good cine-goer will forgive them. Oh, just like those characters! Aah... Yet, there were some moments in the second half that looked like they'd evoke some emotion out of me. But, they remained half-hearted, half-baked. And it's sad that a romantic film cannot stir you. Same goes for the comedy parts as well. Except for a couple of well-timed one-liners by Omi Vaidya and R Madhavan, the film barely kept me from smiling. I guess I should be thankful that I didn't have to cringe too much. On that note, let's bid adieu to another rom-com that misses the mark by a mile. ]"
470,"[The Woman in Black, simplistic as the title is, will haunt you for a couple of minutes after you walk out of the theatre. That's a sign of a successful horror film, some would say. The film reminds you of the 1960s horror films (the production house Hammer Films have quite the success run), with elaborate production design, familiar horror tropes and a plot that one can't go wrong with, but in spite of spooking you successfully, there are quite a few bones one can pick. However, if horror is what you went in looking for, unadulterated horror is what you will get.Adapted from Susan Hill's novel of the same name, The Woman in Black is set in the Victorian era where young attorney Arthur Kipps (Danielle Radclife) has to be sent to North England to sell a (haunted) house that is so cut away from the village, it can only be reached by a long marshy causeway that is covered by the sea during high tide. Arthur's job is to revisit the house for the original occupant's missing documents.Local legend has it that the house is haunted by a woman who mourns the death of her child, something the villagers did nothing to stop. Arthur realizes this could be the reason for the number of children dying in the village. He goes ahead with his job, despite of multiple warnings from the locals. We are introduced to his financial burden in the beginning, and even though that could be reason enough to go into a haunted house, Radcliffedoes a decent job in selling his curiosity to us, about the house and its story. It's the idea that he is married man with a kid that doesn't go down too well. You keep trying to understand, why they would cast Radcliffe for this part - was there a dearth of actors who looked 30 plus? Because Radcliffe most certainly does not. He also has that perennial expression on his face - the same kind that Harry Potter carried in his movies at every moment of looming danger. Minus points for repetitive acting and disbelief there.Having said that, the film's production design reminds you of homes that genuinely give you the creeps - the kind of haunted houses that needn't do much, while it's play with light, shadows, rocking chairs and wound-up toys are enough to creep you out. In that sense The Woman in Black relies on old-school horror tricks, with creaking staircases, random glimpses of half-decomposed ghosts in black, doors shutting tight on their own. We could thank The Woman in Black for reminding us that we can get spooked by the simplest things. A good amount of spine-chilling visuals also add to your entire horror film experience. Cameraperson Tim Maurice-Jones knows what he needs to get the entire picture together - aerial shots of a misty sea in pure grey hues, shadowed forest trees and their play with light and your regular minimalistic piano for background music - and you're gearing yourself for 95 minutes of periodic covering your eyes and jumping off your seat.]"
471,"[In the spirit of full disclosure, the 8.30 AM show I was booked for was cancelled due to a technical glitch. The 11 AM show that I rebooked myself for, started at 11.50. So bear in mind that I had a mighty, almost 4-hour long frustration pent up.Even so, finally when the trailers before the show began, I dutifully reminded myself. ""It's not the makers' fault. It's not Prateik Babbar's fault that he can't act the show didn't start on time."" As the film reels on, I tell myself, ""Oh don't be so harsh even though you can do better make-up with your recently acquired knowledge about lip shades and sundry. This is a regional film trying to reach out to a wider audience. Accept those sensibilities."" And stop talking to yourself. With that reprimand in about the 15th minute of the film, I promise to give the film a fair chance. But Ek Deewana Tha didn't want it. I was allowing myself to acknowledge that problems with inter-religion marriages persist and are not bygones of the 80s and 90s, even if we claim to have embraced the 21st century; that there is something very sweet and innocent about 'love at first sight' even if it is by a character you couldn't care for. I'm not going to be judgmental about what a good-for-nothing he is. I appreciate that having been fed on characters that are white or black, it's natural for me to get annoyed by a lead lady who is thoroughly confused about her priorities in life. It does happen in real life, doesn't it? And then, I gave up. Groping for slivers of hope isn't good enough. The actors have to look and feel real. Awful dialogue delivery + awful dubbing + awful make-up = total exasperation. In addition, this romantic film grows twists and turns, one would tire of, even in a thriller. More on that later. First, please tell me there is some news byte, somewhere, that talks about how director, Gautham Menon repents the choice of Prateik Babbar and Amy Jackson. I haven't seen any of his Tamil films but I'm told that the Ek Deewana Tha's original is an amazingly touching film.We could even have blamed Amy Jackson's dubbing for the lack of variation in intonation, but any one fish from Finding Nemo is more expressive than her and Pratiek Babbar put together. It's a miracle then, that there were a couple of scenes that make you sense a spectacular moment between the two. There was even a misplace but well-done father-son scene between Sachin Khedekar and Prateik BabbarJust when you are beginning to get hopeful about some click between chemistry and biology, you are cut rather rudely into the next scene and land into the next abrupt event in the leads pair's life. The background music adds to the chops from one scene to another and sometimes dishevels you bang in the middle of a film. That coming from a film touted as a musical by A. R. Rahman and Javed Akhtar. I don't know about them or Gautham Menon or the genius marketing team that came up with that tag-line, but my head hangs in shame. What could still have been a sweet film in the blast-from-the-plast kind-of a way completely lost it in the last half an hour or so. In its attempt to do something different from the regular love story, we have writers going amok and finally confusing themselves like their lead character about what they want out of this film. The climax is such a cheat that one's you are through with it you realize, the relaxed, build-up of the whole film was with only this purposed in mind, as if all the writing energies were focused only on making the audience guess and double-guess. You realize that the first two hours of the film had nothing really going in them or for them. I started out, hoping that I wouldn't let the frustration from the delay of the show come in my way of enjoying a romantic film. As I recount the things that went wrong, I wonder if some of you might think that I allowed that to come in my way of being completely disappointed.]"
472,"[Leave your brains at home, is a phrase I detest. Unfortunately, I keep hearing it with regard to the many illogical films that have been resurfacing off late. As much as I wanted to make my protest loud and clear, I realized it might just be a bit premature. We all have our brainless entertainers, only assuming the term brainless means different things to different people - precisely why I thoroughly enjoyed the slick, pointless yet charming Knight and Day. In Knight and Day, Tom Cruise plays Roy Miller, a CIA agent on a mission. He meets June Havens, your average neighborhood girl (assuming all average neighborhood girls look like Cameron Diaz) at the Boston Airport, and while he uses her as a mule to carry an important device, here they begin their adventure. He whisks her from Boston to Brooklyn to the Caribbean and to Austria, now that she's involved in the mission, and they fight out the mafia, FBI and miscellaneous villains. It's a typical Tom Cruise film - and you've got to love it. While the film gathered more or less negative reviews, it got me thinking - since when did Tom Cruise films go out of fashion? He's stylish, easy to please, and his charismatic presence makes you forget about logic and relevance. But who's complaining? We jump from state to state, and mingle between their flirty-ness (which is admittedly a little damp between Diaz and Cruise). Each escapade later, Roy comes back for June, saves her from perennially being under the radar, and we find ourselves falling for him again. How can you not? Even Diaz, with her wide-eyed feminine glow makes you smile. Well, maybe if you find yourself feeling indifferent to the overt charm that this film oozes, its flaws will stare you in the eye. For example, no character apart from these two seems developed. There's tons of pointless action, superhero moves on Cruise's part (hey, I'm trying to be neutral here) and most of all, every plot point in the film is guided by some illogical band-aid move to throw it forward. For example, you'll notice in every tough situation, Miller will suddenly drug June, so she can escape having to face the situation. Cut to, June opening her eyes at home next day and we aren't told how the situation was handled. The DVD has some fascinating extras - and hold your breath - it's called ""Wilder Knights and Crazier Days"". Some rib-tickling interviews with Cruise and Diaz, followed by on-screen bloopers and also a look into some of the stunts that Cruise and Diaz did themselves. The latter is an interesting watch, as we watch Diaz take on a car stunt for the first time, while Cruise, who's known for doing his stunts by himself, breezes through. It only makes the film that much more believable and fun. Director James Mangold (of Walk the Line fame) seems to have his agenda straightened out. Knight and Day has a great looking pair, some crazy (flirtatious and charming) dialogue, theatrical action sequences and just charm, charm everywhere. The adventures are dramatic, over the top and ridiculously comical - in a good way (also depends on how you chose to see it). If you're in the mood for it, Knight and Day will give you exactly what you want. It's a genre that brings nothing more or less to the table - question the flaws, but enjoy it nonetheless.]"
473,"[On being released alongside this week's Bollywood valentine flick, Ek Main aur Ekk Tu, a friend of mine had a rather snide wisecrack to make on Spielberg's War Horse. ""So essentially, War Horse is a romantic film with a horse?"" he said. In my head, I decided I would make no such presumptions; that so many rights had to make for a brilliant film (the nominations, Spielberg's sensibilities on non-human and sensitive war films - ET, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan). Barring John Williams's avalanche of a background score, and Janusz Kaminski's beautifully visualized picture of the film, War Horse is in actuality a long-drawn, schematic film about a boy and his relationship with his horse that tries to compel you to fall in love with it. Based on the novel of the same name by British author Michael Morpugo, the film is also set at the backdrop of the World War. Albert (notable debut by Jeremy Irvine) gets attached to his purebred Joey. As the war seeps through the English countryside, his family has to sell Joey. The narrative then moves to Joey's point of view, somewhere around 1918. He meets Emile, a French farm girl who lives with her grandfather and is a horse-owner too. The difference between the two owners is depicted beautifully from Joey's point of view - as Albert is passionate and rustic, Emile is gentle and subtle. Celiene Buckens as Emile is a delight, often bringing in lighter moments, as she compares the two horses to two boyfriends she never had. But before we can rest with the changing narrative we are taken back to Albert's journey - who has set out on a mission to find Joey.War Horse at many points becomes too epic, forcing you to feel the same sense of splendor that one must have felt with films like Schindler's List. This film however, is nowhere close - the story is rather old-world and laborious, and so is the production design, sets and several moments of the performances by the lead actors. To be fair, you have to give it to Spielberg for allowing the audiences to sensitize with the non-human protagonists in his film (see ET, and now War Horse). The cinematography by Spielberg's right arm, Janusz Kaminski is meticulous and the clear winner of the film. He manages to bring out the right play of light and colours to make the film a very pretty picture. You do feel for Joey, you move alongside him in the film, but by sheer pacing, War Horse fails to grip you. You don't feel that lump in your throat that most World War films bring with it. The war sequences are swift and grand, reminding you of films like Kubrick's Paths of Glory and the hues and treatment also remind you of the civil war from Gone with the Wind. The visuals are magnanimous, but somewhere in his journey to get a ""wow"" out of the audience for War Horse, Spielberg has lost out on the most intrinsic part of the film - connection. War Horse remains a luxuriously larger-than-life film with a potentially heart-tugging premise, which looks pastoral and splendid but becomes too long and doesn't stay with you. ]"
474,"[By virtue of being the intense audio-visual medium that cinema is, there are always certain emotions and situations that are bound to make some sort of a dent in your heart, no matter what the final cinematic outcome of it is. So, bitter feuds between best friends, unrequited love and the ilk will always have some effect during the few hours in which the only thing in your field of vision is the cinema screen.Aditya Sarpotdar's Satrangi Re is a film that has these moments in abundance, by virtue of which the film is never totally unwatchable. However, the film rarely manages to rise above the rather persistent mediocrity in its screenplay. That combined with a rather wishful but generic directorial effort mean that Satrangi Re settles into being just a lazy weekend watch on the telly, nothing more.Set in Goa, Satrangi Re is essentially a rehash of Rock On. Rego, Yezdi, Nick and Jai form 'Goonj', a promising local band that aspires to make it big on the national scene. On the side, three of the four are also final year engineering students. Each of them has their own set of problems that stem from their respective social and financial backgrounds, apart from the obvious problems that aspiring musicians as well as engineering students would face.With an unforgivable runtime of about two and three-quarters of an hour, the film is easily about 30 minutes too long for its own good. While Adinath Kothare as Rego is clearly the focal point of the story, each of the four lead characters actually gets ample footage, with a bit more detail into their backstory than the audience usually bargains for. One must confess that there are a number of scenes in the film which audiences would be able to connect with. The frustration faced by parents when their son doesn't appreciate the sacrifices made by them for his education, the plight of the son in turn, who isn't able to impress upon his parents what his true calling in life is - these recur in the film in some form or the other for all of the lead characters. However, these scenes deserved to have been treated with far more precision, to be able to stay with the audience hours after the film is over. Senior actors Vidyadhar Joshi and Uday Tikekar, who play Rego's and Jai's fathers respectively, are the picks of the cast. The four main leads themselves are fairly easy on the senses, if a little too typical in terms of their look and attitude. Amruta Khanvilkar as the vivacious RJ Alisha looks pretty as usual and for a change plays a character that suits her. One of the biggest letdowns of the film is the music. As is the case with most Marathi films, the music is pleasant. But for a film where music is almost another character, the film deserved memorable music. Satrangi Re has an energetic, youthful feel throughout because of the manner in which it is shot. Goa's beauty is captured well, though it would have been so much better if some of Goa's character and personality were captured as well.Ultimately, Satrangi Re appeals only in spurts. When one walks away from the film, the feeling one gets is that director Aditya Sarpotdar obviously wants to be. But it will be at least a few more films before he actually is.]"
475,"[The biggest mistake I made was to have seen the trailers. You've seen the trailers, you've seen almost the first 30-40 minutes of the film because, the bits that don't make it to the promos are mere ""fill in the blanks"" to the punch lines. It's a good thing that those one-liners and the timing with which they are delivered, are perfect. And though almost the entire film is predictable, the climax deviates from the ""regular"" zone making the film two notches above what it might've been, as promised. The problem though is that the narrative throughout the film, seems drab and flat, and thus the film stays average. For all we know, it could be intentional because the film advocates being average.  In that sense,  Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is more about parenting styles, the generation gap a restrictive style could create and society's constant insistence on being unique. As you discover the opposites that Riana (Kareena Kapoor) and Rahul (Imraan Khan) are, which is pretty prompt and in-the face, the thought never leaves you that a thick finger is being pointed at how they've been raised. And eventually, almost the entire second half becomes about how the wrong-doing parents are dealt with. And that bit doesn't deviate one bit from the expected. So, you spend a good portion of the first hour to get to the point where the trailers left us, get to the point and land up right in the middle of an annoying family squabble. Yet, most of the time you aren't complaining whole-heartedly because you are in good company. Kareena Kapoor and Imran Khan keep you entertained. Kareena Kapoor with her chirpy Riana Briganza is exactly Geet (Jab We Met) and she has always been a joy to watch. Especially, since she has mastered the art of stopping her 'happy' act where it might get 'trying to hard' and thus annoying. Such people in real life, do get overbearing, after all. Imraan Khan as the wannabe anal retentive, but easily slips into any form the other person wants him to take, does represent a section of our youth who are figuring out their identity. This lost identity bit makes the chemistry between the two fizzle off since most of the time, it feels like Riana is coaching Rahul as an older sister would. And automatically that converts Rahul into a younger brother because the mold his character is capable of shaping into, instantly wants him to be like her, like a younger sibling aspires to be like the older one. While  Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu might deviate from the standard at some places, at various others it takes on every new-world cliche that we have been exposed to in the past decade or so. The extra-aspirational parents to the 'everything goes' parents - are all caricatures. Not to mention all of them are given either exaggerated situations or are over-acting. We also cannot deny that the 100%-guaranteed-chirpy-woman-of-the-film is also quickly falling into the cliche zone. Sure, we all know enough of this type of a person. But now, her sole aim is to bring about a change in the typical, serious man of the film. And that's getting repetitive across films. Yet, I will look forward to director, Shakun Batra's next film. There were some strokes in character establishment that showed a glimpse of hope. Like the background music in the opening scene or the characters' self-description at the psychologists. Of course, there is naivete in other directorial decisions like say the whole Day 1 - Day X super-imposes. One - bad lift-off from 500 days of Summer; Two - why take on something like this if you're not going to use it wittingly throughout, are going to club days and give it the lamest every conclusion!In many ways,  Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is a trying hard to be Wake Up! Sid. Thematically, except for one change, the ingredients are pretty much the same. Woman in distress helped by the man; the man is provided with personal growth by this otherwise confident (older too!) woman; one piles-on at the other's home; one is finicky about cleanliness, other is not; a cute birthday; parents need to be confronted; a passion for photography and so on. But it's nowhere close to what its predecessor achieved. The one change is sweet and such shifts need to be encouraged because they draw from real life, but I've seen real-life situations which panned out with a lot more heart-tugging. ]"
476,"[Imagine a 4-year-old, who has just learnt how to draw, making an anniversary card for his parents. That is Shala for you. It may not be the greatest thing to happen to the movies since Citizen Kane, but while it lasts, it makes you smile.Set in the 1970s in a village in Maharashtra, Shala is essentially a tale of teenage love. Mukund Joshi, a smart little 9th standard kid, harbours a crush on his pretty classmate Shirodkar. Sorted as he seems on the exterior, his life revolves around her. What makes Shala an immensely watchable film is that the writers - Milind Bokil (story) and Avinash Deshpande (screenplay) - show some genuine insight into what goes on in the mind of a teenage boy falling in what he knows is love.Mastering the art of stealing glances at her without drawing the attention of your classmates, joining the same tuition classes as she, that burning feeling you get when the teacher scolds her in front of everyone in class, the list is endless. The writers manage to capture a number of these tender moments in the script. These moments are further embellished because director Sujay Dahake (who has also edited the film) manages to eke out some endearing performances from the largely teenaged principal cast.The political backdrop of the film, by virtue of it being set during the emergency is what takes it a notch above the ordinary. While the implications of the political backdrop stay in the background, it casts its shadow on the movie throughout, particularly for Jitendra Joshi's character.Cinematographer Diego Romero's beautiful frames and the earthy colour palette make the film a visual treat. An ensemble supporting cast lends solid support and adds a measure of credibility to the film. Dilip Prabhavalkar as the school principal and Nandu Madhav as Joshi's father stand out amongst the lot. Both fine actors, it is hard to imagine anyone else in these roles. Santosh Juvekar as the liberal-minded school teacher has mastered the art of over-acting within the limits of being endearing, and he doesn't disappoint here as well. After Zhakaas, Amruta Khanvilkar, once again, looks pretty but is mis-cast. Ketaki Mategaonkar as Shirodkar is extremely charming. The choice of her as the girl who our young protagonist Joshi falls in love with must be lauded, because she isn't pretty in a conventional sense, but in a rustic way. Her personality seems to make Joshi's love for her seem that much more real.But ultimately, Shala is Joshi's story and young Anshuman Joshi carries the film on his tiny but able shoulders. He is spontaneous, endearing and extremely confident. Make no mistake about it, the character of a teenage boy in love is a complex one. Young boys that age are rarely given credit for the troubles that they have to navigate through. Adolescence is tough to deal with, and Anshuman Joshi's charming portrayal brings that to the fore wonderfully.What may work against the film is fact that it does take its time to make its point. The makers are in no hurry to tell their story and while that can put some people off, the fact remains that life rarely unfolds at the speed at which a Christopher Nolan film does. Perhaps you need to experience what Joshi does in this film to truly identify with him. Shala worked for me because it was a genuine, slice-of-life story, something that is rarely seen in Indian cinema today. Shala's Joshi &amp; Shirodkar may not join the likes of Rick &amp; Ilsa or even Raj &amp; Simran in terms of immortality, but they will ensure pure warmth and joy when you watch them share those sweet little moments in this charming little film.]"
477,"[In stories where the common man is wronged, I've always wondered, why no one tries anything other than the common man's frustration with the system getting to him near interval or a little later? What if he succumbed to corruption, power-goons , etc throughout the film - because that would actually be close to reality, right? Common man is a common man, no Singham or even Dr. Anand? Besides, I had begun to get a tad bored with the typical improbable and pseudo-inspiration, notwithstanding the few well-made ones. The answer is a Gali Gali Chor Hai. If you don't have the inspiring lead character, you'll supposedly need loud side characters, a haywire plot that attempts satire, and a more-or-less boring story despite a decent central idea. Bharat (Akshaye Khanna) is the common man in question, who crosses a goon-of-a-politician to get stuck in a rigmarole, that starts with a threat from a police constable that he'll be taken into custody, because a thief reported that he stole a table fan from Bharat's house. Yes, you read that right. Just in case, you didn't see subtlety being thrown out of the window with the name Bharat, you will see irrelevant, loud and tacky characters do the do. Not to mention the three 'Of course's and one 'what the...!?' I could've put in that one-line synopsis. Gali Gali Chor Hai is just that kind of a film. Exaggeration under the guise of satire is used to make a point and beats the purpose by distracting from the point itself. Sure, some of my sentiments as this country's common woman are echoed, but the impact is short-lived. And there is the obvious, in-your-face parallel with the Ram Leela sequences, but again the manner in which they are edited into the main story mar the effectiveness. The side-story of Bharat, his suspicious wife, Nisha (Shriya Saran) and their paying guest, Amita (Mugdha Godse) are as distracting as the over-acting by most of the cast is. What was the purpose of this diversion from the main story? - is an entirely different question. My only guess is that they were trying to run a parallel between the ironies of how national and domestic systems run. Yes, I laughed at  my thought and am giving you a chance too. The gamut of other bit roles performed by Annu Kapoor, Vijay Raaz, Satish Kaushik, Akhilendra Mishra, Murli Mishra and Amit Mistry all have potential to be interesting but stay half-exposed. Throw in the mandatory item number, love song and one on social activism with no real rhyme or reason and you have a perfectly ignorable film. Tch! I do feel like applauding what director, Rumy Jaffery and writer, Mumukshu Mudgal have tried here. It is indeed courageous to have central character that surrenders more easily than he combats. But, everything other than that is a little too overbearing and takes improbability and pseudo-inspiration associated with common man stories to the other extreme. Gali Gali Chor Hai made me prefer the other kind of fake.]"
478,"[A true villain doesn't have any attachments and is pretty much soulless. Why he wants to achieve ALL, no one knows, but that's all he wants - achieve all. The lack of reason instills fear in both his enemies and the audience. Kancha (Sanjay Dutt) is that truly detached villain and Viju (Hrithik Roshan) is trying to get there. Every time he commits a murder, you see a weight of sadness in Viju's eyes, which reminds us that his parents wouldn't approve. That difference is what makes the audience root for Viju while dreading Kancha. And this polarity in emotions for the characters makes Agneepath a watch well-worth the time and money. The only charm of 1990's Agneepath was in watching Vijay Dinanath Chauhan struggle between his father's ideology which became intrinsic to him and how he thought the world really needs to be dealt with; between seeking his mother's, thus the 'good' world's approval and knowing only one way to avenge his father's death. 22 years later, this struggle has been blunted. Yet, the charm has taken new form. His single-minded focus on seeking redemption in revenge takes you through almost t-h-r-e-e hours of watching a film. In this SMS age that, in itself, is a huge achievement. It can be argued that a couple of songs could've been done away with, but that is exactly what Agneepath takes rightly from the 90s style of film-making. Build tension, break tension with some good-sounding music and lyrics, build tension within the said song to keep the story from stalling and let it beak with another intense/action sequence. This tempo worked very well then and from the way it's done here, can live on if used by the right hands. Sure, there is nostalgia hidden there, so I'm really interested in seeing how the generation, which hasn't grown up on that style, reacts. Enter Hrithik Roshan. While his ""star"" value will rope in enough audiences from Gen-X, he's very unlikely to remind the previous generation of Amitabh Bachchan. That won't be because he hasn't done a good job, that he has, but because director, Karan Malhotra's interpretation of Vijay Dinanath Chauhan is so different. So intense is his gaze and so serious his demeanour in his first hour of screen-time that you feel relief and joy when you see him smile. Priyanka Chopra must've known when she signed the film that all she, like her character, Kaali, is required to do is lend support. She plays the simple girl with simple needs role to perfection. The backdrop Kaali grew up in grants enough leeway to make her, cheesy, silly, smitten-in-love character, adorable. Similarly, it's good to see Kancha (Sanjay Dutt) have that slight change to his background which gives him additional motivation to be in love with that particular village. Yet, I wish his character was less dramatic. The madness he represents made him into a caricature and thus a tad bit comical. This stands out even worse because none of the other characters are really cartoon sketches. And we know, with the underworld, drugs and body-trading as a backdrop there is enough scope for mockery. A ready and available character was that played by Rishi Kapoor, Lala. Through most of the film, you forget you are watching one star after another, but when you see Rishi Kapoor beating and being beaten up by Hrithik Roshan, a certain line is crossed and you suddenly realize the intensity of what's going on on-screen. A moment is created, even if it is not the pleasant kind. I also liked the moments that the makers chose to keep from the original like the one with Viju and his mother having dinner or the one when Viju visits Officer Gaitonde's house. Also, some new moments were created like the one where Viju is living his sister's childhood as he would've liked to or the one which he shows intentions of getting married. I admit, these moments might make the movie sappy and a little longer than some would like, but they certainly added to the second dimension of Viju's character - that which makes him likeable despite his mean streak.  Yet, it doesn't mean there were layers to various characters that were fascinating to peel off. A couple of dimensions from each character were chosen and they were given definite shape - enough to keep you engaged. Yet, plugging some holes from the original doesn't mean new ones aren't created. Some things came too easily to Viju and some events needed better explanation. But, today's Agneepath was still a better version for me while retaining a lot of what I loved about the 90s. More importantly, this Agneepath loses the unnecessary comic relief and doesn't glamorize itself with the oh-so opportune exotic locations. Now the question, what about the people who either belong to that 1990-Agneepath cult or have never seen it, so they have nothing to compare it to?]"
479,"[The split screen, black and white poster of Sudhish Kamath's independent film Good Night Good Morning gives away much about movie than meets the eye. Ofcourse, the obvious ones go first - it's a film around two people, Turiya (Manu Narayan) and Moira (Seema Rahmani). You are given two perspectives, an oscillation of conflicting ideas of romance and a conversation that starts at night and ends in the morning. In this gamut of duality, lies the film. It also tears you, as a viewer into two. Should you criticize the film for its flaws and amateurism? Or should you applaud Sudhish Kamath's ability to stressfully release an independent film in a world where the demand for shiny, bright and rather expensive stars erase a basic sense of plot? Allow me to discuss both sides of the coin. The film is set in New York on New Year's night. It had me hooked the minute it spent exactly 30 seconds panning through Times Square. We are immediately introduced to the tone of the film, with a nostalgic jazz background score walking with you into the introduction. It's a beautiful way to begin the film because it's this visual romance that is later contested in the conversation that makes the film. Here Moira (Rahmani) is seated in a bar, alone on New Year's Eve. She's defensive and wary of any stereotype coming her way. She meets Turiya (Narayan) and a bunch of his inebriated friends in the bar, after which we immediately cut to her hotel room where she's talking to Turiya on the phone, who's driving back to Philadelphia with his friends. The first few minutes of the conversation (on screen, as the narrative keeps jumping back and forth) are my favorite. It has that awkward undertone where both parties try their hardest to make it sound that the conversation is offhand. You know, the kind of conversation you would have with a stranger, where you justify it to yourself in the name of boredom. Moira is playful and unabashed, whereas Turiya is self-conscious and trying his hardest to make an impression. What follows is a dialogue-heavy intervention into both their lives. Their notions and ideas of romance slowly unfold - and it beautifully pits you into two confusing boxes. Where do you lie? With Turiya - who in spite of claiming to be a romantic is stuck in a love-less, obsessive rut of his past or with Moira - who claims to have had her share of heartbreaks and still does not give up on the idea of romance? Most of the film is shown in split screen, where the easy camera presence of both Narayan and Rahmani makes the conversation a pleasant, engaging one. The film attempts to steer away from the monotony by cutting to flashbacks and parodied hypothetical situations that the pair put themselves in to make conversation. My personal favorite is the film's spoof of the Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. It's through these little skits (that are in color, and serve as a pleasant alternative) that we explore the two protagonists' psyche. There were some moments in the film however, that could have easily been done away with. For example, Turiya's friends JC, Hussain and random passed out guy (Raja Sen, Vasanth Santosham) are unnecessary. They try too hard to stand as valid side characters (especially Raja Sen, who's adorable in parts but his constant cannabis-smile, gets a bit tedious) It would have been a much more personal and stimulating film had the conversation been between her in the hotel room, and him driving the car alone. The sub-plot of the friends brings the film down, just when you're deeply getting involved in the momentum of the conversation. The entire angle of Moira's past, her constant nightmares also drag a bit towards the latter half of the film, and we are told very little about Turiya's past. It's a misbalance that can be seen and it is these aspects that give the film an amateur feel. The conversation that ties Good Night Good Morning could have done with more wit. It should have been the kind of conversation that starts with a crackle and the need to outshine the other to prove yourself of a worthy dialogue. .  Such a conversation has the ability to become like a magnifying glass with time - one that makes you plunge into deep recesses of yourself through the medium of another person. However, as someone who writes about films, I can only imagine the stress level I would be in if I were to make a film of my own. Primarily for this reason, Kamath's film (he's also the film critic for The Hindu) should be watched and discussed. It's the least you could do as a viewer.  Though in isolation, Good Night Good Morning is an interesting film, and an extremely fascinating play of a type of conversation that most people have had. ]"
480,"[If you compare the black and white picture of J Edgar Hoover and Leonardo DiCaprio, you'll see just how shockingly different they look from one another. So when I learned that the latter was playing Hoover in Eastwood's next film, I felt a wave of anticipation. Having enough faith in the politically meaty character of Hoover, Eastwood's ability to bring to the table a perspective (in a biopic) that might be least expected and Leonardo DiCaprio's stellar dedication to give his best performance and raise the bar with every film - I walked out of the film knowing my faith has been keptA biopic on one the most contributive head of the Bureau of Investigation, J Edgar is a subtly paced, psychologically underlined film. During his tenure as the head (he's also responsible for adding the term Federal to the FBI); he worked around 8 presidents, who feared him as he kept secret files on almost every public figure. He in turn, feared his  mother (Judi Dench), who is quite strong with her words and, through whom the politics of his sexuality is best surrounded. She believed, ""I'd rather have a dead son, than a daffodil for a son"", and it could be for this reason that his homosexuality was always closeted. This fact however, is never openly discussed in the film, and only beautifully hinted at in a passing manner. He also shares screen space with another woman, FBI secretary Helen Gandy ( Naomi Watts ). They share a first date when he decides that marriage would be beneficial for him.   Watts ' subtle performance as his life-long secretary is notable. Rumored to be in a homosexual relationship with his associate and lifelong friend, Clyde Tolson, his public image disallowed any homosexual man (or black men and any woman) to become FBI agents.  Eastwood 's film mostly captures this public portrayal. In true Eastwood  style, the 81-year old auteur marks his stamp on the film by moving through his ferocious decline as a public figure via 2 main time periods: 1920s and 30s when he was establishing himself and the late 60s when he recounts his life while transcribing his memoirs. The latter part of the film easily captures  DiCaprio's finer performance. It's quivering yet controlled and dominant. You can tell that Eastwood isn't a big fan of Hoover, having stripped down the character to its hypocrisies and insecurities. However, the magnanimous picture that he puts forward of the tumultuous life of J Edgar Hoover makes you realize that it's his public mask that Eastwood admired most: the overriding, authoritative and narcissistic head of the FBI. The film's back-and-forth narrative lacks punch in some parts, as the Lindbergh Kidnapping case and the John Dillenger case unfolds. You wish the otherwise repressive relationship between Tolson and him could have been explored more, but in many post-movie interviews Eastwood mentions as that's just not how he saw his film. This is what I meant when I mentioned the film to be a least expected perspective on the life of J Edgar. Rumours about his sexuality were rife through his tenure and post - and even when the film was under production it's an angle most viewers were expecting. In that sense, J Edgar stands as a bit of a letdown, to be ignoring such a potentially controversial subject matter.  DiCaprio only grows with every film, and J Edgar is testament to this fact. He grows as Hoover in the film too; while the younger Hoover is a bit one-dimensional in his ambitious enthusiasm, the older and more vindictive Hoover remains one of DiCaprio's best performances till date. Writer Dustin Black (also written Milk) follows a fairly similar structure of a biopic, which includes the establishment, demystification and subtle homage of a public figure but kudos to Eastwood for sticking with a perspective (even though a bit narrow) and bringing out a personal, emotional and immensely political representation of J Edgar Hoover. The film could have done with better lines, and a tighter, more convincing first half (which tries too hard to establish Hoover as a likable figure, presumable as an antithesis to his portrayal later). However, watch the film for DiCaprio's Hoover - his inner struggle and a commendable take on someone who was once known as America's second most powerful man. ]"
481,"[Recall a movie that you've thoroughly enjoyed. Remember the feeling of excited and gleeful anticipation for the next line because you are enjoying every bit of whatever is unfolding in front of you. That would be very close to what I experienced in the first 20-25 minutes of Chaalis Chauraasi. And then I tried to fight the boredom coming from a flat narrative and I lost the battle.There is still the foursome Naseeruddin Shah, Kay Kay Menon, Atul Kulkarni and Ravi Kishanwho try to keep up the energy and chemistry they had generated earlier on. But their effort has to be too manifold to make up for the deteriorating pace of the narrative. The downfall starts with the flashbacks of the characters. In hind sight, not only are the backstories a hindrance to the flow, they are also unnecessary. Nothing is made out of those histories in the rest of the film to justify the screen time they eat up.  Same goes for the item numbers. Though they have cute lyrics and it's fun to watch Naseeruddin Shah use his dancing skills in an item song, the variety wears out by the second song. It's a shame that a director, Hriday Shetty who could be doing better things had to resort to the regular ""commercial"" modes. At the most, one song can be accepted as a part of the script, the others are all forced. I know, I could copy-paste the earlier paragraph in almost every review I write (which is why I usually avoid any mention of songs, unless they are extremely good or bad.) But I choose to elaborate here because this film could have hit bull's eye if it were not for such intrusions. It had the cast, the slightly off-center style of direction, the off-beat story going for it. A potentially quick, zany, crisp film has given way for a plot that lost itself on the way to home run. It's a shame because there are very few films which have a good story line from start to finish. And Chaalis Chauraasi is one of them. The problem is what they chose to fill it up with. The comedy of errors loses its charm almost as if the dialogue writers lost their inspiration and the director felt over-inspired to elongate every other scene a little more than was necessary to keep the audience interested. Yet, I'd look forward to Hriday Shetty's next film. It just feels like Chaalis Chauraasi was his attempt at finding his footing. Here's hoping he has.]"
482,"[One of the first few lines in Ghost go, ""I'm a doctor. I have to behave responsibly, right?"" And this along with the typical texture that goes with a B-grade horror film, seal the deal as far as how good the film is going to be. And the case gives itself little chance to be re-opened.The little chance is afforded by the way in which spooks are created the first couple of times. Slimy insects and hardcore gore begin to do the do only to be rudely interrupted by special effects that make the images look like they are shot with a thermographic camera of some sort. I'm all game for filmmakers experimenting with techniques, but unfortunately this looked like a cop-out - a method in which they could avoid showing the implied gore. Or use of this technology was more feasible than the refined prosthetics skills that would be needed to pull it off. That could've made the film better in terms of number of genuine creeps provided. Unfortunately, the creeps come from cheesy dialogues in romantic situations like, ""Why are you so beautiful, Suhani?"" or ""I'll not forget you till I forget myself."" Incidentally, this is supposed to be a break from the 'intense' horror situations and thus the love affair is rhythmically interspersed with the core of the Ghost story. Usually this genre leave enough opportunities for the actors to scream, squeal and thus show their acting prowess. But Ghost's story doesn't have room for that because the lead pair barely every faces the spirit that's causing terror. Our man Shiney Ahuja has one break-down but that's about it. Sayali Bhagat has a few sequences to give a moderately scared expression and she quite firmly holds that one through most scenes - including the romance. Shiney Ahuja here.&gt; Speaking of jokes, usually horror movies are associated with two kinds of laughter from the audience. One is kind that is at the film for trying to scare and the other is nervous laughter that comes right after a stand-alone spine-chilling scene. Ghost gives neither. It tries its bit of Christian symbolism with a character named Mary and frogs and locust-like insects, but the pace is so slow in many of the non-horror sequences that I could hardly be bothered to make sense of them. The only silver lining in this entire gamut of things that go wrong with Ghost is that it is directed by a woman. I don't think there are too many women have directed horror films. For what it's worth that needs to be applauded. And yet, I cannot recommend you to watch it even if you had nothing better to do. ]"
483,"[Senthil, Venkat and Pari are three engineering students of the prestigious Ideal Engineering College run by the terrifying Virumandi Santhanam better known by his students as 'Virus'. Sound familiar?That Shankar's latest flick, Nanban, is a remake of the highest grossing Indian film of all time - Rajkumar Hirani's 3 Idiots - is no secret. Shankar isn't exactly the greatest exponent of the art and craft of cinema. But he has always been someone I have admired, simply because he has the ability to close his eyes and visualize bigger than most other Indian filmmakers. What is truly disappointing though is that this time round, when Shankar closed his eyes, he saw exactly what Rajkumar Hirani did. The characters, their idiosyncrasies, their nicknames (and shockingly, even a continuity goof!) remain the same. Any attempt by me at not giving the movie away would be futile, considering that about a billion people have already watched 3 Idiots. There is no doubt about the fact that, as a standalone film, Nanban is fairly enjoyable. In fact, in my opinion, the script of 3 Idiots actually lends itself more towards being cinematically adapted in Tamil than in Hindi because character quirk-driven comedies are often funnier in South Indian languages.Nanbanmotors along largely because it has a competent cast who look their parts. Though not too far away, Vijay is still on the right side of 40, which is to Shankar's credit, unlike Mr. Hirani who hoped that the audience would look the other way. More importantly, Vijay looks closer to his supposed age than our own self-anointed champion of 'sensible cinema' did in 3 Idiots. Jeeva and Srikanth are extremely likeable in the roles played by Sharman Joshi and Madhavan respectively. Even Sathyan is a darn sight better than Omi Vaidya. Sathyaraj as Virus is convincing and succeeds in not turning his character into an overt caricature. Ileana (playing Kareena Kapoor's character) looks gorgeous and has an arresting screen presence. The music by Harris Jayaraj is pleasant and easy on the ears. Most tracks are hum-worthy, though a few tracks are unwanted in the flow of the film. While this phenomenon of remakes and 'sequels' is anyway the worst thing to happen to cinema since Tusshar Kapoor, a remake can be accepted if it brings at least something new to the table. 'Nanban' was never going to shake off the 'been-there-seen-that' feeling. However, it is absolutely unforgivable that an official remake so shamelessly copies the original, the change in the very nature of the core target audience notwithstanding. I always enjoy listening to my co-audience react to what they see on screen, and this time was no different. However, I must confess, I had to get the PVR guys to remake a couple of cups of coffee for me to go the distance. ]"
484,"[Christmas movies are usually so predictable, you want to abandon the entire act of movie watching during the holidays. (Okay maybe Home Alone 1 wasn't all that bad). While sometimes the cliche works, it becomes a delightful movie watching experience if you can pack in some innovation along with your regular message-in-a-film Christmas movie. Arthur Christmas is just that; a witty, creative and sparkling film based on the one question every kid wants the answer to: How does Santa deliver all gifts in one night?We are taken into the spectacular world of Santa's elves (or in this case, the term military base would be appropriate) with a stellar opening sequence, which is a spoof on the mad rush before Christmas Eve. The setting is a battlefield and the mission is to deliver gifts to each child in the world. We are introduced to Santa's army force then, who climb down roofs with black masks and heavy-duty equipment, (like gadgets to determine how asleep the children really are) dodge alarms and deliver. Reindeers to this force is like bullock carts to us. Back in the North Pole, having completed his 70th mission, we see that Santa is ready to retire. His older son Steve (Hugh Laurie), also responsible for modernizing the whole gift delivering process, is uptight and employs whip-cracking meticulousness. His younger son Arthur (James McAvoy) is the klutz; the underdog who we know will rise to occasion very soon in the film (exhibit A of cliches that work).  Before Christmas Day, they find that they have missed one delivery. While Steve thinks they can ignore the little girl, Gwen's gift (voiced by Ramona Marquez), Arthur is bent on making the delivery. Every child is special, he says. And that is Arthur's first win.Arthur Christmas is a delightful film, the kind that makes you really feel up to the holiday spirit. An intricate CG animated feature by Aardman Studio (in association with Sony Pictures Animation and also the studio that brought us Chicken Run) Arthur Christmas is a fascinating film with a sense of humor. It's witty in many parts, indulging you in some clean, intuitive comedy. The film's real gem though is the swift action, coupled with background music that could give any thrilling film a run for its money, that is used first in the opening sequence and then by Arthur and his team later in the film. The action, intervened welcomingly by fast humor every now and then, will keep you fidgety and involved, even though you know the outcome of the film. Rest assured there will also be a smile plastered on your face. Too bad Arthur Christmas released a bit too late in India. That remains the only disappointment of the film, but hey, Easter's on its way? ]"
485,"[I've often wondered whether writers know of the power they are bestowed with. As a bearer of fiction, you could make your characters dance around naked and pass it off as literary. It was fascinating to me, and I always wanted to write a book where I, the presumed author, would have a live conversation with my characters, talking to them about how they feel being part of the book. You know, almost like a really cool making of. Although, I guess Marc Forster beat me to it with Stranger Than Fiction. Stranger Than Fiction is one of those subtle movies that blow you away and you don't even realize it. It's revolves around Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), a meticulous auditor who leads a predictably disciplined life. Crick's wrist watch is his life; timing every second of his day. The film grips you right in the beginning when, coupled with quirky graphics, we learn of how his head works. Numbers, road maps and calculations surround him as he plays out his life for us. With no background music to support his introduction, it's one of the finest beginnings to a film you would witness. You're then brought into the movie with a calm narration, only to realize that it's a narration Crick can hear. His life turns upside down when he can hear a woman narrate his life for him (not to predict but almost as it happens to him). He consults a psychiatrist (Linda Hunt) who then refers him to a Literature professor, Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), to be able to help him with the text of the narration. To me, this entire sub-plot of the film is one of the most deductive interpretations of the consumption of literature (I'm including Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation into this too). Hoffman deconstructs the text to the core - trying to analyze it's genre by studying its archetypes; whether it's a comedy or a tragedy (much like the film for us viewers - we are amused at the premise and tragically trying to ignore the existentialist question the film poses.)Interspersed with this is the story of Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a writer who doesn't know how to put an end to her new novel. She's sent an assistant to help her keep deadlines (Queen Latifah, whose so talented but extremely wasted and unnecessary in the film) - when she realizes, through the course of the film, the power of her story as she meets Harold. Harold also meets Ana Pascal, a motor-mouth, tattooed Bakery owner who hates his kind - ""taxmen"". They develop an endearing relationship that starts with conflict and hate and moves onto a path of discovery. The growth of his relationship with Ana and his periodical meetings with Professor Hilbert brings the film together in a savory, indulgent manner. You are barely over this phenomenally understated premise - when you're provided with the backdrop of edgy, charming characters and twisted relationships. Together they make Stranger Than Fiction an alluring film. The Blu-Ray edition of Stranger Than Fiction is packed with extras. The first and the most entertaining one is an audio commentary of Hoffman, Forster and Will Ferrell- it's funny and goofy and provides a welcome breather to the stimulating movie. This attitude is present through the 6 featurettes that talk about the casting and making of the film. The disk also has 9 deleted scenes, mostly of Crick's visits to the therapist. For die-hard fans of the movie (which I have now become after writing about it), it's a DVD you must possess. Stranger Than Fiction is the kind of film that makes you realize how brilliantly crafted it is only as an afterthought. The kind that will make you go, ""Wait a minute..."" and you'll rethink the film in your head. It's in that process that you'll want to butt into Crick's narration, help him out, make your own deductions about the text, and suggest possible endings to Eiffel's book. Most importantly, when you are slapped with the recurring existentialist question that this film is posing, you will not want to answer it but you'll smile because the film hasn't attempted to either. ]"
486,"[Ankush Choudhary is clearly a man in love with himself. In addition to being the lead actor of Zhakaas, he has also directed the film. So he gets to walk multiple times in slow motion towards the camera (Ray Bans in tow), leap to super human heights and stay there long enough to wink at the audience, and in general make himself feel slightly more important than he actually is. Last seen in the disastrous Pratibimb, he has the aura of someone that you really cannot take too seriously.Perhaps that has helped Zhakaas in some measure, because inane as it is, I still came away feeling mildly amused. The prime reason for this is the fact that the film really doesn't take itself too seriously. It promises entertainment and if the reaction of my co-audience in the theatre is anything to go by, it manages to deliver that in some measure.The plot itself is as ludicrous as can be. Right in the initial reels, it is revealed that Ankush's character leads a triple life, with three different girls. A series of gags then go on to explain the Five Ws and One H of this situation. Needless to say, logic and anything that might appear close to it in a thesaurus take a backseat in this flick. The performances in this film add some measure of school-boyish charm to the ridiculous goings-on. Ankush himself is surprisingly endearing, because he invests himself completely into his part, or should I say, parts. Of the three girls, Sai Tamhankar as the spunky photographer Neha succeeds in sprinkling some believability into her part. She manages to emote well for the most, with the occasional tendency to go over the top. But then, in this film, who doesn't? Pooja Sawant as the innocent head of an ad agency is pleasant. Amruta Khanvilkar looks marvelous as the Kolhapuri bombshell, but is completely miscast vis-a-vis her performance. The guys who come across as the true winners though, are Jeetendra Joshi, Pushkar Shrotri and Vikas Samudre as the three lovers who are denied their lady loves by the cool stud (?)Ankush. Each of their characters has unique quirks that seem pointless, but add a flavour to the comedy. They are involved in a series of madcap jokes and set-pieces that are delivered so convincingly by them, that you are willing to forgive their downright stupidity.Technically, the film has nothing to boast of. Colourful in its feel, it still leaves a lot to be desired in terms of production value. Also, though this might be a problem with the projection at the theatre where I watched this, it seemed that the framing at times was simply careless, with characters' heads getting cut off for no apparent reason. The music of the film is purely functional. The fact that a couple of the songs have Hindi lyrics, however, is truly disappointing. It is hard to see a point in making a Marathi film that has Hindi songs. Ultimately, what manages to ensure that this film isn't a complete waste is the fact that, quite like Priyadarshan's Malayalam films of yore, a number of the jokes are such that they wouldn't have been that funny in any other language. For that reason alone, I afforded a smile once the film was done.]"
487,"[For 89 mins, The Darkest Hour is a crisp, fairly-spine chilling film that gives you the necessary thrills, considering the only good part of the film are the visuals. But then again, a film about alien invasion banks heavily upon the visuals. It seems director Chris Gorak (also art director of Fight Club and director of Wanted) takes that pre-requisite a bit too seriously. The Darkest Hour has flat characters, almost no plot development, but you forgive and forget it as you submerge in the chilly background music and the scary pace. The film starts in Moscow, as two Americans Sean and Ben arrive to sell some high-flying technological software. They meet two American girls eventually (Natalie and Anne - the fact that they don't have second names, let alone a back story should give you enough proof about the lack of depth in the film) and party the night away. It's then that invisible aliens - what look like a lethal, dusty mirage - eat into the entire city, killing every single living being. We are shown the alien's point-of-view as well - where humans look like walking tissues, and on coming in contact with them, humans get reduced to dust. The film then tracks how the survivors from their first attack (all four Americans and the handful Russians they meet on the way) battle their way through this apocalyptic mess they find themselves in.If you need a couple of reasons to watch the film, you'll be happy to know the effects and scare-factor is at its maximum. It's a phenomenon I find most of these apocalyptic films have in common regardless of their basic plot. You are going to find the idea of the world (as you know it) coming to an end, extremely creepy. It's a must-have in any film with such content (like The Day After Tomorrow and 2012).The Darkest Hour banks on this factor. The first half hour is truly terrifying, and you learn to ignore the unexciting acting of the lead foursome (Emile Hirsch, Olivia Thirlby, Rachael Taylor and Max Minghella) but soon enough you realize the color palate, the plot development and the threat (aka the aliens) are all pretty flat. It's simple; if the aliens are going to be invisible, the plot has the keep the viewer hooked on by topping the horror-factor every now and then. What you see The Darkest Hour is the same incident being repeated again and again. People dying the same way (barring one bus sequence which keeps you on the edge of seat), and only sporadically, you get spooked by some unexpectedness. The real winner of The Darkest Hour is the cinematographer, Scott Kevan, who puts in front of us an extremely gripping visual of a dark city under threat by supernatural forces. It's this sight that will bring you chills more than dusty, invisible aliens, repetitive background scores and one-dimensional, predictable performances. ]"
488,"[Is Players, The Italian Job? It is. But, it is not. Then it is. And then again, it is not. Because, after all, it is an Abbas-Mustan product. The twists and turns turning into more turns and twists is a given. The lawn tennis that the characters play with their loyalties is also expected. You wonder whether the makers are screening a joke on themselves as the good thief and bad thief mock each other for being predictable. So what if we might not be able to make out which one of the four characters is the mole? We know one of them ought to be, and that is predictable enough, dear directors.So, there is no sitting on the edge of your seat business. There is no thrilling chase that has you wrapped around itself. But, I must admit, that some of the twists made the plot a little more interesting, even if it was only for a few minutes. Players is also a lot less dramatized than I anticipated. And it is, thankfully, less stylized than the trailers made it out to be. But, that isn't saying too much, is it? I expected it to ooze substance-free form in every frame. So, it's not like you are going to miss the slo-mos nor is there a dearth of pauses after every third word for dramatic effect. And since that's pretty much intentional, what chance do our actors have to give a decent performance? Not that we have too much hope left from this set of actors. A quick reminder - Abhishek Bachchan, Bipasha Basu, Sonam Kapoor, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Bobby Deol, Sikander Kher. It is a shame that I have not a good word to say about even Bachchan Jr. The rest are aging only worse with every film. And boy, did they over-estimate Neil Nitin Mukesh's potential to deliver a non-standard role. The only reasonable actor in this ensemble is Omi Viadya who is comic-relief incarnate. A couple of one-liners have brilliant timing, and that's all it takes to remember him. The whole theater laughed out loud at a joke which has been done to death on sms/facebook/what-have-you! That's how remarkable Omi is. But, like any other Abbas-Mustan film, you are guaranteed some exotic locales that are shot beautifully. A slick movie, Players surely is. In fact, they've chosen not so often visited Russia and New Zealand, and have gone as close to the North Pole as a film crew can go too. The sound also contributes in making you feel like you are a part of the action. There were a number of scenes where you can feel your seat pulsing with the beat. Yet, Hindi action thrillers are miles away from their Hollywood counterparts, despite having smart action and camera work. They lack originality. They remain just that - remakes of other films. The problem also is the directors' strong belief in adding masala to suit the Indian palate. I don't get the insistence on adding song and dance, lackluster at that! Nor do I understand the rationale behind going out of the way to include comedy amidst tense drama. Just because it makes me laugh, it doesn't stop it from becoming a distraction from the flow of the story or a particular scene. And it only adds fidgety minutes to the run-time. One of the things that I like about The Italian Job is that it makes a team out of strangers because they have a common enemy. And fortunately, Players doesn't lose that flavor. Alongside there is a tidbit of romantic undercurrent. It's a good thing that it is kept in its place and there isn't much ado about it. Abbas-Mustan, of course, also add the extra load of twists. Only this time around there is a relatively better attempt at tying loose ends. Players might work a slight shade better only because the expectations from it are so low. Watchable not must watch, like many other films running on TV. ]"
489,"[I had never cried as much as I did while watching I Am Sam. I was warned, and I still went ahead thinking it's a 2 hour film. I'll shed a few tears, what else? Tears were an understatement, is all I'll say, for those 2 hours. So when I picked up Milk to review, I channeled out everything I had heard about the film. There's just something else about watching a film post its Oscar hype, to be able to agree, disagree, dismiss or confirm the conclusions people made of the film. Or better so, to make your own. Gus Van Sant's Milk is a biopic on Harvey Milk, a gay rights activist. Sean Penn gives a powerful performance, as a 40 year-old gay man who moves to San Francisco from New York with his boyfriend Scoot Smith (James Franco). Set in the 1950s, the couple open a camera shop in the neighborhood, and before he can realize,  Milk finds himself fighting for gay rights. The film captures a true essence of undercurrent of the bubbling homosexuality, and explores how San Francisco became the gay capital. Here we see a strain in relationships, as Milk moves. After having run for Board of Supervisors, 3 years in a row, he finally gets elected, where we see him shift from being a nervous, closeted man to a public-speaking, motivational national figure. All this, however, happens at a cost. He meets eccentric lovers, who behave as pit stops for his political career: Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch), a fellow community organizer, followed by Jack Lira (Diego Luna), a Mexican-American who becomes jealous of Milk's advancing career. This is my first problem with the film. It relies on formulaic story-telling that pre-supposes it's only plot-points to be a conflict between the personal and professional. On one side we have a transformation happening, we see an individual's journey so beautifully played by Penn, but when interspersed with a preachy sub-text about neurotic relationships, it becomes a bit monotonous.That is until we come to Dan White. One of Milk's most crucial relationships, White was a conservative Catholic man who considered homosexuality a sin. An alcoholic, White (played by Josh Brolin, of No Country for Old Men fame) becomes Milk's biggest and most tragic hurdle. Their complexity, and powerful whiplash of personalities is so intensely carved out, it almost swirls you in. As a fictional biopic, the DVD has some phenomenal extras. It almost serves as a mini-visual autobiography of Harvey Milk, with a small docu called Remembering Harvey, where noted political figures of the time speak about him, deleted scenes - with a brilliant extended version of Milk's first public speech and 'Marching for Equality' - a behind-the-scenes look at the various marches, protests and real-life events through San Francisco that Milk had fought for. Definitely a DVD worth investing in.Milk isn't about a flawless political hero. It's a personal account of motivation, hurdles, and an imperfect yet touching story that had to be told. In any which way possible. ]"
490,"[There is a wonderful new stereotypical character in India these days - he or she who says, ""I hate Bollywood man. They can never match up to Hollywood."" Such people seem to enjoy bangs, booms and style - a staple of Hollywood films, particularly espionage thrillers. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is probably not for them. It isn't for someone who is looking to be on the edge of their seat without being willing to invest themselves mentally and emotionally into the film-watching experience.  Tinker Tailor is a film that can be appreciated at multiple levels. The wonderful mood that the film manages to create (in keeping with what international espionage in real life must probably be like); the measured pace with which the multitude of layers of the plot are revealed, the wonderful performances by an ensemble cast of British actors; and most importantly, at least for me, the satisfied yet incomplete feeling of wanting to be involved with the experience just a little longer, even after the lights are back.The film primarily deals with the British MI6's search for a mole within their ranks. Gary Oldman plays George Smiley, a veteran intelligence man who is entrusted with this task. Set mostly in London in the 1970s, the pace of the film is slow, like a teabag kept in lukewarm water, left to brew by itself.The film is mostly shot in telephoto lenses, making the viewer feel like he is spying on the character through binoculars - distant yet desperately trying to be involved with them. This is doubtlessly intentional, considering the espionage theme. Concurrently, the colour palette is bleak and pale. Nothing stands out visually, perhaps because nothing is what it seems. Director Tomas Alfredson's sensibilities are clearly European, but that is stating the obvious, considering where he is from. Gary Oldman anchors the film with his performance. There are few actors in the world like him simply because every performance of his is a masterclass in how to be the character. Colin Firth is marvelous as Bill Haydon. My current favourite actor, Tom Hardy, brings raw intensity to his character of Ricki Tarr, an agent in hiding. John Hurt and Benedict Cumberbatch amongst others lend noteworthy support.The film is far from perfect, particularly in its writing. The screenplay of the film, as mentioned earlier, takes it time to unfold. There were also some portions that were quite ambiguous, to the point that it would perhaps need another viewing to fully comprehend. Even then, the nervous-but-never-high-voltage tension that the gently unfolding events created was something that I savoured through the film.Thrillers with an international backdrop seem to be the flavor of the season, what with M:I - 4, Don 2 and Sherlock Holmes seeing releases in successive weeks. This film is a far cry from the films mentioned above in almost every aspect that they can be compared in. Perhaps that was why Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy worked for me. I enjoyed some of the others, but this one stayed with me far longer.A word of caution though - while Tinker Tailor can prove to be an immersive experience for some, I suspect that it won't appeal to a majority of the audience. It is the kind of film I would recommend to someone only after I spend an hour with them to figure out their taste in cinema.]"
491,"[The Sherlock Holmes I grew up with was overtly English, Victorian in his dressing, a schematic mastermind and a detective with the magical powers to solve anything. Blame it on the BBC adaptations or the selective reading of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work, but nowhere did he figure in my head as an action figure. In Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, however, a different web is spun: one of homoerotic camaraderie, eccentric, super-hero sequences of Holmes and Watson saving the world, or ummm, the situation at hand (with their physical grit, and not so much their detective powers). In the second part of Ritchie's adaption of the age-old classic, Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr. reprise their roles as Watson and Holmes, respectively to outsmart their conniving rival Dr. Moriarty. Theirs is a battle of the intellect - its 1891, and Moriarty's main agenda is to scheme and destroy, at the backdrop of the tension between France and Germany. He aims to use his intellect in ways that will reinforce his power. Jared Harris as Moriarty is at his curled-lip, sinister best. Holmes on the other hand, is shown using very little of his intellect. Downey Jr. as Holmes spends much of his screen time in bizarre disguises and mumbling what one could have only hoped was genius calculations.Oh, but you do smile. Once you learn to ignore the (yummy) homoerotic subtext between Watson and Holmes in this version, you manage to dreamily watch the two as they spill with love for one another. Because Law and Downey Jr.  could give Bogart and Bergman a run for their money. You almost forget about Rachel McAdams (as Irene Adler) and Noomi Rapace (as Simza the gypsy fortune teller, also the lead in the Swedish, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) - but not quite always. Stellar star cast; they act as perfect catalysts to the munificent characters of Holmes and Watson.Their witty repartee acts as a charismatic breather between the high-voltage, testosterone-induced action through the film. You can see them not getting enough of one another, playing it up like a little tease meant only for the indulgent audiences' eye. One can trust Ritchie to turn things around, and how. I'm told, after a long discussion with a Sherlock Holmes expert, that Ritchie's adaption of Holmes and Watson are very close to the books. That Holmes is as eccentric and babbling as we see in this film, and together he and Watson are almost super-hero like in their demeanor. I checked, only to find that Watson had an army training past, and Holmes has been trained in Martial Arts. And I was impressed. Ofcourse the film has Guy Ritchie stamped all over it. This adaptation, unique as it may be, does have its clear establishing moments. Coupled withZimmer's background score (not his best, but one that provides the signature feelers for high-intense scenes), mad scientists, gypsies and stylistically treated 72-frames per second action, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is feisty and delectable. If you were looking for the more cognitive version of the series, you always have the BBC version (featuring Benedict Cumberbatch).Ritchie makes sure in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, entertainment is elementary. ]"
492,"[Squeak. Squeaaaaak. I could save you the trouble of watching this movie (and forgive me for summing up a review in one sentence - but PLEASE don't) by letting you know that Alvin and The Chipmunks: Chip wrecked is only about the squeaking. The third part to a decent first movie (Alvin and the Chipmunks), Chipwrecked takes on pop culture references of Cast Away and Lost, while it shows Alvin, his chipmunks and their female doppelgangers getting stranded on the island of Dr. Cliche, after creating havoc on a luxury cruise. The chipmunks are, at best, ignorable. They could be cute if they would just tone down the squeaks, but then why would they?Chipwrecked then moves through a slapstick adventure, churning out chipmunk-ish versions of hit songs (Destiny's Child, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga). It's one song after another and one slapstick joke after another. With no binding ingredient. It's almost like buffering YouTube videos in a row. Seriously, there's nothing more to the story - I almost wish I had more to write.What you get however, is a series of annoying, helium-voiced sequences by writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger(Of Kung Fu Panda fame). Essentially, Chipwrecked is a lazy and dumb attempt to repeat its winning performance at the box-office. While, in the 1950, the Chipmunks were more known for as cartoon-based band that only released helium versions of popular songs. I'd want to write about how children should be given better options for a festive season movie, but as much as I hate to admit, this is the perfect movie for children to watch. With a large tub of popcorn, they can continue to revel in loud, bratty behavior (so let's just say if your child isn't bratty, don't take him/her for this). If you're an adult however, and you're in a movie theatre having to bear through this film, you can be grateful that it's only 87 minutes long. Alvin and The Chipmunks: Chip wrecked is formulaic, predictable, crass and extremely obvious with its in-film branding (Carnival Cruise Line). It's like the producers of the film sat down one evening and decided on how to channel the money that was coming in - and put crucial cinematic elements like plot and character-relationships. Take your kids for a picnic instead, or for a weekend getaway. Or just sit at home and watch How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, and you'd be better off. ]"
493,"[The difference between being an adult and wishing you were still a school/college going child is ""wishful thinking"". As an adult it'll always be the unachievable ridiculous thought that you had - and as a child, it would be a fantasy. A world, which you know with all your might that you'll reach to. Eat Pray Love in some parts becomes that for you, as an audience, to wish and dream for a soul-searching journey across three countries (Italy, India and Thailand).Almost Julia Roberts' comeback movie (after a couple of forgotten appearances, like in Ocean's Eleven, Valentine's Day) in Eat Pray Love, she plays Elizabeth Gilbert, a New York based travel writer who has a dream life - money, success and a marriage, but is confused and not happy. As a newly divorced, directionless single woman, she decides to spend four months each in Italy, India and Bali to find herself - or maybe achieve answers to questions she's not yet formed.Through her journey, we learn that nothing about getting out of your comfort space and moving to different cultures is easy. While we can relate to the Indian part of her journey, it seems mortifying to live in a tight neighborhood in Rome, with scrapping wallpaper, middle-finger-showing 7 year-olds and men who grope your bottom as a tradition. And yet, Rome becomes for Gilbert the ""Eating"" part of her discovery. She eats; to learn about surroundings, to mingle with warm, new friends and to be happy. Elizabeth's next stop is an Ashram in India - possible her toughest 4 months, but most rewarding. We see her grapple with her stability issues and find her sense of self. She meets Richard (played by the charming Richard Jenkins), a Texan with alcohol issues who comes to the Ashram for similar reasons. Their chemistry is delightful; right up Roberts' alley of being a stimulating co-actor with older men (Pretty Woman, Erin Brokovich).It's in Bali, that she finds balance - in the form of Love. She meets Felipe. Javier Bardem is easily the best part about the film, with his calm, endearing demeanour. Elizabeth falls in love with Felipe. You ask no questions there, because it seems so easy to fall in love with Felipe, a music composer set in Bali. Full credit goes to Ryan Murphy (also co-writer of the film) to make her entire experience extremely live-able. Every bite she takes of the Spagetti and Pizza Margherita in Rome, you can feel her insides thanking her for it. Every calm breath she takes in the serene ashram in India, at the backdrop of colorful marriages and children running behind tires, you live the moment with her. You fall in love with Felipe too, and there lies your ability to wishfully want to Eat, Pray, and Love.The movie has beautiful photography, featuring gorgeous shots of the Colloseum, the Tuscan countryside, even the food Gilbert eats. The cinematography in India wasn't as colorful and explored as I would have hoped, but it more than makes up for that folly in Bali - which almost looks like a beach-heaven. Coupled with culturally appropriate background scores (Opera-esque husky vocals in Rome, the Sitar in India and a calm Harp chime in Bali) and Eat Pray Love makes for a beautiful picture. The DVD has 5 minutes of extra footage - mostly of Gilberts' discovery process of each country. It also contains a featurette with Ryan Murphy about his experience with the film. You wouldn't miss either of the two.Unlike the book, which seems like a rich New Yorker's extremely convenient travelogue about whining her way to balance, Eat Pray Love the movie genuinely allows you to travel with the protagonist. You don't address the underlying questions through the film, the same questions (Where does she get the money? How can she just walk out on her life and expect the world to fall at her feet?) that nag you while reading the book. These questions however, fundamentally bind Eat Pray Love. Every now and then, it will come back to you in some form. You will want to criticize the film for being a Cinderalla book, and too romantic. But that's exactly when you know the adult in you is talking.Take your pick. You could question, criticize and flinch at the idealism in the film or you could get inspired and paint your own travelogue.]"
494,"[Sharyat made an impact on me with its posters itself - with Sachin Pilgaonkar's fiery look and the rustic feel that I got from it. While the film itself will definitely not re-write cinematic history, Sharyat is an important film for Marathi cinema. Finally, technique in Marathi cinema seems to be coming of age.Sharyat has some impressive production, looks slick in spite of the village setting, and also manages to squeeze in a few Matrix-esque bullet-time shots. True, there are times when the technique seems over-done. There is an overdose of motion blurs and ramped jib movements, and the film often appears excessively colour-corrected. However, I'm willing to overlook this in the interest of the larger picture - no one can say that technique hasn't reached the shores of Marathi cinema. Directed and co-written by Viju Mane, Sharyat firstly needs to be lauded for its choice of theme. It revolves around the traditional bullock cart races that are held in rural Maharashtra, and the fierce battles that ensue to gain a specific honour that victory in the annual races bestows. Sachin plays Dhananjay, an ace bull racer who hasn't raced in five years because of a tragedy that forced him to leave the village altogether. Circumstances bring life a full circle for him, as he has to race yet again for a multitude of reasons. The film, not surprisingly, has its share of flaws, its screenplay being the biggest. It could have been far more taut even in its main plot; a half-baked love-story on the side makes it worse. Thus, in spite of the fact that the film's runtime is just a shade over two hours, it stills seems longer than it needed to be. It is also often prone to some over the top drama and inane plot twists.Adding to the film's woes are three unnecessary songs - two item numbers (one of them with a particularly derivative and silly hook line) and one romantic song (which incidentally looks a lot like 'Ishq Sufiyana' from The Dirty Picture.) The songs themselves are fairly ordinary. The only memorable song in the entire film is the title track 'Sharyat Lagli'. It is catchy and is placed well in the film. While there are no major complaints with regards to the performances in the film, I often found myself wishing for Sachin's dialogue delivery to be a little less stilted and stoic. He has a great intensity and completely looks the part. But there were times when the way he delivered his dialogue just didn't do justice to the emotion in his eyes. Sachin Juvekar, who plays Sachin's brother, is mostly endearing, with the occasional tendency to go over the top. Veteran Marathi film and TV actor, Neena Kulkarni (also a known face in Hindi films) plays her part well. Tejashree Pradhan is pleasant, but has a truly insignificant role.Which brings me back to the technique. Marathi films, by their sheer lack of commercial viability, will never be able to match the scale and technique of Hindi or Tamil films. In fact, these days even the average budget of a Malayalam film is significantly higher than that of a Marathi film. While that truly is a pity, the bright side of it is that Marathi filmmakers are forced to stretch every rupee to try and make their films 'look good'. For that reason alone, Sharyat (reportedly made at a budget of about 3 crore) is a film to be proud of. In spite of all of its glaring flaws which otherwise could have put me off, Sharyat is a film that I don't regret spending money on, because I could see the filmmaker's intent to make sure that no one could look at this film and say that Marathi films are shoddily produced. Hopefully, Sharyat will set a new precedent for technique in Marathi cinema.]"
495,"[What are you going to do with a villain who always has a Plan B unless he's busy making you believe his Plan A failed? Hate his guts? For sure, yes. Especially since he is cocky and every line he utters is a wise-crack. As an afterthought, you also admire the writer's capacity to throw in twist-after-twist while making sure you know motivations behind characters' behaviors. But maybe he over-estimated our capacity to be interested in the turns. After a while, it gets tiring. The HUGE slip-up in the second-half and the blurring motivations make Don 2 an average Hindi film. When the choice is between a scorned woman's wrath turning into gullibility and Don having a change of heart - you know the writer has copped out.  No explanations are good enough if you are switching character traits that you took two films to set-up, within a heartbeat. In fact, I wanted to laugh out loud at the proceedings, but my brain hadn't finished being bewildered at what I had just seen on screen. Et tu, Farhan Akhtar? I suddenly had a flashback from Dil Chahta Hai's ""proposal at wedding"" scene. Gosh, what a turn-off that was! Anyway, there are a lot of things going for Don 2. Shah Rukh Khan is certainly one of them. He makes you forget, you are watching Shah Rukh Khan. Either that, or this is the best use for his typical stutter laugh. Maybe that spluttering chuckle should be reserved for villainous roles and avoided while being comic or romantic. Not just that, his voice modulation works. His look - especially in the first half an hour or so of the film goes completely with his character. And of course, his character is such that, almost all the actors have only one of two things to do, when around him - act as if they are on their toes and don't trust him, or visibly show they despise him. Everyone from Priyanka Chopra to Boman Irani to Nawab Shah do a decent job of that. There is a slight variation in the form of Om Puri who is a dispassionate CBI officer and Don is just another criminal for him and Kunal Kapoor who is fresh and self-assured. It's a shame then that, you can write a few decent characters; you have the intelligence and flair for intertwining plots to make them work as a thriller; yet you end up making a film that nosedives into mundane in the last 20-30 minutes. There is also the matter of too much time taken for stylizing everything. In his attempt to add oomph to many scenes director, Farhan Akhtar, over-estimates the time the audience will take to let the twirl in plot to register. In turn, he gives the audience time to figure out what's going on and ends up making the scene predictable. And this happens scene after scene. Fortunately, these scenes are shot well. The film is also a collage of beautiful shots from around the world. Some may even accuse it of being a travel company's brochure that wants you to visit each of those countries. But, it is also an evidence of Don's reach and the expanse of his power. The action sequences are choreographed and shot well too. But you can't help but feel there is so much more Farhan Akhtar can do. It almost seems like he is testing waters one step at a time, ""Hollywood does this, let me try. If this clicks, then next time, I'll experiment with what I really want to do."" Maybe, it's just my wishes taking over. Meanwhile, you are left with spectacular camera and stunt work, but nothing that you haven't seen in action films so far. The only thing left to look forward to then, is the smart aleck remarks Don is going to make to leave the people around him retortless. That too begins missing the mark - makes it too filmy without being memorable enough. Especially, since you have seen many of them in the promos. It's almost like dialogue writer Farhan Akhtar is trying to live up to his father's name. Alas, he overdoes it and in the process repeats his father's lines way too often. We know you love the lines your dad wrote, Mr. Akhtar Jr. We love them too. But now, you have begun to kill them for us. For now though, I'm going to grudgingly appreciate the loathsome lead character you've tried to create. If only you hadn't let the devil take human form.]"
496,"[An eclectic bunch of quirky characters living in a chawl  in Pune form the crux of One Room Kitchen, a charming little film that made me smile more than once. After the disaster called Pratibimb last week, I had considerably lowered my expectations when I went in to watch One Room Kitchen. Fortunately, not only did the film exceed my expectations by a long way, but it also raised my expectations for the next Marathi film that I watch.The story, the setting, the technique, everything is as simple as can be. However, what the characters work, their dialogue, their relationships with each other and the sheer fact that even the nicest of them have those rough edges that make them seem real. The story primarily revolves around a young couple, Ravi and Suman. Happy in their world in the chawl, their life takes a turn when Suman meets her old friend Neha, and happens to see her apartment. Thus begins their struggle to obtain an apartment of their own.The chawl itself contains a host of highly endearing characters, one more interesting than the other. So there is the smart, enterprising youth who works in a garage, the henpecked, out-of-work man with a terrifying wife and a dubious bottle of cough syrup, and the gossip-loving old couple who have been abandoned by their son. And then some. The simple script is embellished by some earnest performances that truly warm their way into your heart. Bharat Jadhav as Ravi and Bhargavi Chirmule as Suman have to carry the film for the most part, and they do it well. Kishori Godbole as Neha is extremely charming, and her character truly lights up your heart. Amongst the character actors, Vijay Chavan, Viju Khote and Ashalata stand out for their dialogues and comic timing. Rajesh Shringarpure, playing Neha's rich, businessman husband struggles, but the cast around him often makes up for it. Rakesh Bedi, playing a sleazy Gujarati broker hams, but to good effect.Veteran actor Dr. Shriram Lagoo makes an extremely brief appearance, but his mere presence has a certain, inexplicable power to it. One surprising cameo in this film is that by Helen. I only wish she had a meatier role, one that had a proper graph to it.The film has its share of flaws. Everything gets wrapped up too conveniently in the end. The climax could have been made more impactful, instead of making it all fit like a kindergarten jigsaw puzzle. Also, the manner in which Tilekar has attempted to juxtapose life in a chawl to life in an apartment is really insufficient and even reeks of a bias. Each style of living has its own pros and cons, but the director's tilt towards one side in this film is hard to miss. So much so that it appears that perhaps Tilekar doesn't feel this way in real life, but has forced it into the film to make it work.Technically, the film leaves a lot to be desired. Simple things like avoiding the UV haze that forms around characters and ensuring sharp focus in shots would have gone a long way in ensuring that technical inadequacies don't hamper the storytelling. However, in spite of its many flaws, One Room Kitchen works because of its honesty. What I enjoy in Marathi cinema is how it often captures the essence of a Maharashtrian lifestyle. This film does that. So, even though the film is not exactly a must-watch, I would still recommend it to people, only to support the rise of Marathi cinema, and to savour the simple joys of life along the way.]"
497,"[Jo Hum Chahein is cheese and sap at its worst. It's been a long time since I've seen so many women getting wooed by such crap after acknowledging that it is crap. So, they are supposed to be smart and yet they fall for whatever it is they were intended to fall for. Beats me! Theoretically, there is always at least one thing nice to say about a film even if you hated it. That usually comes in the form of dialogue - which we've ruled out - or basic plot or situations or acting or at least the music. But, na-ah! It felt like I was watching a school play where the teacher said, happy means :-), and angry means :-| and sad means :'( and all of this can be said with flat dialogue delivery. No voice modulation necessary. The music sounded generic though some of the lyrics were decent. Note the word 'some' there. At other times, the lyrics were trying to be cool with words like disc and CD thrown in. Anyway, it's not like you were going to go watch the film just for its lyrics. There were these fleeting things which I thought was pretty sweet for such a superficial film. One was where a character says, ""I used you because I could."" Another where a character forgave another for a blunder because they wanted to forgive and not because of some melodrama was emoted their way. These two were pretty insightful things for characters to say and do. So much so that they actually seem accidental in this set-up. Yet, nothing about Jo Hum Chahein is average enough to watch even if it's playing on TV. Skippity-skip!]"
498,"[Okay, I'm going to try and come up with a cooler idiom for 'Too many cooks spoil the broth'. Let's see. How about, too many celebrities (actors) can turn a ""movie"" into a greeting card. Yep, that's pretty much New Year's Eve for you - Every recollect-able, sellable face that you can imagine, thrown into a cliched, predictable movie about the commercial and consumerist idea of New Year's Eve. New Year's Eve is a movie about various characters and their separate experiences with New Year's Eve day. You have Ashton Kutcher and Lea Michelle (of Glee fame) who get stuck in an elevator. Kutcher's anti-New Year's eve feelings gets converted when Michelle, who's a backup singer makes him realize how everyone has their hopes pinned on one day to start over fresh.Robert DeNiro is dying, and his last wish is to watch the ball-drop (a Times Square tradition) this eve. But the hospital's policy doesn't allow him to move from his bed. Michelle Pfeiffer is stuck in a dull, thankless job, when with the help of Zac Efron, she spends a day fulfilling all her desires. Katherine Heigl meets Jon Bon Jovi at a dinner that she is catering for, as he's performing as Rockstar Jensen. They struggle to keep their past feelings at bay. Sarah Jessica Parker plays protective mother to Abigail Breslin (of Little Miss Sunshine fame) but they resolve their issues to let love and hope overcome everything. It is followed by that ""uplifting"" background music that is meant to make you abandon all your cynicism. You know, peppy pianos, a litte hip-hop and ofcourse, they HAD to end the film with 'What a Wonderful World'.I think the biggest issue with New Year's Eve is the screenwriter's (Katherine Fugate) inability to connect with the characters. Having multiple mini-stories works only when you can slowly unfold each, and let the viewers live the stories. The makers are so obsessed, with packaging a commercial commodity, and putting in everything remotely sellable (Zac Efron for instance, after his High School musical fame), I'm surprised the Twilight cast isn't involved in the film.New Year's Eve has some light moments though. Pfeiffer is adorable as a reserved middle-aged woman who gets genuine joy from doing things she never imagined. Halle Berry is hot as always, and she's the one person in the whole film who doesn't overact. It's sort of tiring to place almost every light-hearted film that ""Hollywood"" churns out, into the kind of movie you'd want to breeze through while flipping channels. New Year's Eve is a cliched film that wants to believe it has perfected the formula of making money at the box office. Sigh, just watch Love Actually if you're in the mood for hope, love and more such holiday positivity. ]"
499,"[Brian De Palma's 1996 blockbuster, Mission: Impossible, packed in the plot. It made teenagers call their first 3.5"" floppy disk a 'NOC List'. In the new millennium, John Woo's characteristically choreographed action set-pieces made Mission: Impossible II a cult action film. Everyone wanted to do wheelies and stoppies. In 2006, it appeared as though the franchise had run out of steam. A jaded superstar, a nowhere-near-memorable plot and action sequences that had been done to death in the previous installments made Mission: Impossible III an experience easily forgotten. Only loyalists like me would bother to watch it more than once. (Four times, at last count.)The fourth installment of the series, Brad Bird's Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol may fall way short of being a great film, but it manages to do what appeared to be an impossible mission - it infuses some much needed life and freshness into the M:I franchise. And Thomas C. Mapother IV aka Tom Cruise, who appeared to be past his prime, is back doing what he does best.The film has a plot that isn't too complex, but that has enough meat in it to make it interesting. Ethan Hunt and his organization, IMF, have to clear their name as they are implicated in an event that has the potential to escalate into a nuclear war. Their organization has been shut down, so their resources are limited. The electric Jeremy Renner and the beautiful Paula Patton join Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg in their mission to avert the crisis. What instantly sets this film apart from its predecessors is the droll humour that runs through it. The first installment had no place for humour, while the next two used it only to provide a hint of comic relief. Ghost Protocol, however, has a refreshing undercurrent of dry humour that makes it an easy watch. Then, of course, there are the set pieces. Originality once again triumphs, even as Tom Cruise bears the brunt of a generous dose of bumps and falls. Yes, they seem incredulous and impossible for the most part. But Tom Cruise breathes in every last ounce of his movie-star believability into them, making them genuinely thrilling. Undeniably, they demand dollops of suspension of disbelief, but that truly is a small price to pay for a few thrills. What I personally liked about the film is that for the first time, characters apart from Ethan Hunt get to have a hint of a back story. So, Jeremy Renner's Brandt has a secret that weighs heavily on his conscience, Paula Patton's Jane wants revenge for the loss of a loved one, and laptop-loving nerd Benji, played by Simon Pegg, gets to be a field agent, something that he never thought he could be. Jeremy Renner brings a magnetic intensity to his character. His eyes are always talking, a wonderful quality in an actor. Tom Cruise is in his element this time round, once again proving why he was once considered the biggest movie-star in the world. I love how his face and his expressions make the most preposterous sequences seem real. I also firmly believe that he is one of the most underrated 'actors' in film history. The rest of the cast are adequate.I'm no fan of Hollywood, but one can't deny that even when they make films that want to 'make you leave your brains at home', they do suggest that you bring them along, just in case. Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is one of those films that engage you, that make you enjoy it, even if it makes you go, ""Come on, now that's just ludicrous!"" once in a while.Of course, an Indian review of this film would be incomplete without mentioning Anil Kapoor. He plays a sleazy Indian billionaire, and his portrayal of the character is quite reminiscent of his role in Race. But make no mistake, here is a man who has aged better than most. His role is laughable, but Anil Kapoor deserves kudos for starring in a big Hollywood film way before other potentials from Hindi cinema could. I was hoping against hope that once, just once, he would turn around and say, 'Jhakaas!'All said and done, Hollywood finds it as easy as we do to spend big bucks on cinema that is all about form with zilch content. There will be those who will feel that M:I-4 is in that same space. However, fans of the genre and M:I loyalists will definitely feel the zing that this film has, that manages to make it worth a watch on the big screen.]"
500,"[A Wong Kar Wai film often gives you the feeling of being a voyeur. It's almost as if you're ruffling through the pages of a character's life, in the most ordinary day-to-day manner. Yet, you remain the outsider who has symbolic observations and opinions about the stories.The beauty of such a narrative can be seen in films like Chungking Express and In the Mood for Love - where every character and every story neatly takes its time to reveal its facets. Emotions become like a silent character: Desire in Chungking Express and Loneliness in In the Mood for Love, molding into the parallel narratives. The film revels in its plurality but even so you feel a sense of connection - with the emotions, the characters and the slow brewing of a cumulative story.My Blueberry Nights, Wong Kar Wai's first English language film, however, is undercooked. A film about a New York girl Elizabeth (Norah Jones) who on getting her heart broken, tries to find solace in the Blueberry pie from Jeremy's (Jude Law) cafe. Unable to cope with the pain, she travels from one state to another - Memphis, Nevada, picking up temporary jobs to keep up. She meets quirky people along the way (A heartbroken cop and his ex - David Strathairn and Rachel Weisz - and a compulsive gambler - Natalie Portman) who serve as distractions to her pain.My Blueberry Nights' first problem is Norah Jones. Her vacant expression steers far from being mysterious and secret-bearing. To feel a sense of physical and emotional travel through a film that takes on a journey it becomes absolutely essential to relate with the protagonist. She looks her part, but the credit for that also goes to the indicative lighting and background score, much like most of Wai's films that also use the ambience to tell the story.As Elizabeth becomes Lizzie and Beth in the different cities, the characters she meets are enchanting but only in isolation. As a viewer you might only be able enjoy the pure essence of a passing character when you're able to mark a difference/similarity or random comparison to main protagonist - especially in a film that vows to explore relationships and human emotions. The only connection through the film comes in the form of postcards that Jeremy writes to her. The problem with that is you can sense a predictable end to this wandering tale of discovery, with every postcard. It's the first 10 mins of the film that stay with you - during Elizabeth and Jeremy's interaction, which bring out Wai's true stylistic traits as an auteur. The setting is moody; the dialogues are not spoken but heard in the form of background music. It is when Elizabeth trails off on her personal journey of whatever it is she is seeking, you lose interest in her or her life and you aren't given enough time to develop an interest in the new characters. The true perpetrator of a story in My Blueberry Nights is the soundtrack of the film. Background score changes as per the city she travels to - we get to hear Cat Power crooning in her folksy/indie demeanor the New York sequences. The film opens with Norah Jones' own song 'The Story'. We travel to Ry Cooder and country music while in Memphis and end up with an assortment of Neil Young/Amos lee blues while in Nevada. It's the soundtrack that urges you to stay with the story longer and to make personal connections.The DVD includes interviews with Wai and Norah Jones, plus raw footage from the film. The interview with Wai brings us to realize that his treatment for My Blueberry Nights, one of his latest movies, remains similar to his previous movies - he is still trying to explore the play of emotions in a character's life, and their reactions that brings the story forward.My Blueberry Nights however falls short of connecting. It lingers around with its colorful melodies and moody frames, but before you can shift and get on with the narrative you end up losing interest in what it has to offer. If you are a regular viewer of Wong Kar Wai films however, I urge you to let this mistake pass you by. Drool over Jude Law, hum the soundtrack and watch another of his film's after this one. ]"
501,"[Like it or not, it is true. Dabangg is one of the most influential films in contemporary Hindi cinema. It has, in its own fist-thumping, water-hose twirling way, defined the kind of films we are subjected to these days. Unfortunately, Dabangg has to endure the ignominy of being clubbed with the very same films that have attempted to cash in on its hysteria. So people will always say Dabangg, Ready and Bodyguard in the same breath, even though Dabangg is so much more than the tripe that has followed it.The film has even managed to buck the recent trend of South Indian films being remade into Hindi, by inspiring its own Tamil remake. Osthe, starring Silambarasan (Simbu) in the lead role, stays faithful to its source frame-by-frame, so much so that it even gets bicep-flexing baddie Sonu Sood to reprise his role. For a multitude of reasons however, Osthe falls way short of Dabangg.The superficial reasons are plenty. Dabangg's Chhedi Singh becomes Osthe's Boxer Daniel. (Yes, really!) Malaika's Munni becomes Mallika's I don't know what. The dialogue writer repeatedly invokes Rajnikanth's Sivaji The Boss, only to say that we now have Osthe - The Mass. (I'm still rubbing my eyes in disbelief at that one.) Surprisingly, Osthe is nowhere near Dabangg even in the technical department. The action isn't nearly as well executed, and the VFX look just mediocre in most places. Also, the action sequences are poorly cut. The songs, though, are extremely catchy, especially the title track. However, there was a certain naughty innocence in the soundtrack of Dabangg that Osthe just doesn't manage to recreate. Needless to say, I don't even remember the tune of Mallika Sherawat's item song. And then there is Salman Khan. Make no mistake, Simbu (or 'Young Superstar STR', if we are to believe the opening credits of Osthe) is endearing as hell. He has style, dances well, is athletic, and has a charm about him that is hard to ignore. But few in the whole wide world can match up to Salman Khan's blazing screen presence, especially in a film like Dabangg, where Salman seems to have had the time of his life. Even the sentence 'Simbu's shirt gets ripped off in the end' sounds like someone is trying to make Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus out of Lego.As I said though, the above are merely superficial differences. (Yes, even Salman Khan.) The reasons why Dabangg works and why Osthe doesn't lie far deeper. Dabangg isn't great cinema, of that there is no doubt. However, Abhinav Singh Kashyap never pretended that that was what he was making. The makers of the film reveled in the ridiculousness that played out on screen, rendering popcorn passe and celebrating chana jor garam instead. In the process, Dabangg also captured a wonderful flavor of the Hindi heartland. Try watching Dabangg without looking at any of the central characters or action, and you'll know what I mean. It may not seem so at first sight, but Dabangg was well and truly 'different'. Osthe, on the other hand, just follows a long line of similar films that have been coming out of Tamil Nadu since time immemorial. Punch lines, style, action, catchy songs but no real plot - all these elements are not new to Tamil cinema; they can make these films in their sleep. When they wake up, we get Vinnaithandi Varuvaya, Alaipayuthey, Anbe Sivam and the likes. Simply put, Dabangg will, for right or wrong, always be remembered, while Osthe will just fall by the wayside. The only thing that is remotely comparable in these two films is the fact that Osthe's lead actress Richa Gangopadhyay is as inconsequential to the film as Sonakshi Sinha was.One wonders how director S. Dharani and the producers of the film didn't realize that what they were making was so hackneyed; that no matter how much they proclaimed their lead actor was a superstar, the only way they could make this film memorable was if there actually was an attempt to push the envelope, to do something different. Ultimately it boils down to the simple fact that Chulbul Pandey will be a character that won't be forgotten in a hurry. Osthe Velan, on the other hand, is bound to fall by the wayside.]"
502,"[There's nothing like a movie that jolts you out of your groove. A story about a man who is everything evil, who mends his ways because there's too much wrong in the world anyway. Throw in a religious revelation and a testosterone-spewing conflict filled journey and you'll have a ""gripping"" drama. Fortunately for Machine Gun Preacher everything seems like it's on the right track - Gerard Butler , a post-colonialist debate, a character graph and a title that seems like it's been leaked from a graphic novel.Machine Gun Preacher is based on the real life story of Sam Childers (played by Gerard Butler  in the film) who starts off as a violent, ex-con with a heavy dependency on alcohol and drugs. He and his similarly placed pal Donnie (Michael Shannon) are a couple of pit stops away from hell, you are told. Before you can swallow, Butler  manages to turn his ways as he discovers Christianity. The good thing is Forster doesn't expect you to share the same beliefs. He decides he must relocate to Africa for missionary work, after building a (clean) successful construction business. While Butler  is blue-collaring up, Uganda and Sudan call out to him much like a prayer. Forgive my tone, but it's the exact same feeling one gets while watching the film. The film barely takes any time to establish his sudden transformation to a nice guy, let alone a really nice guy with a soul. It slowly then, transcends into an unbelievable film, and a story that isn't narrated very well. A quick note about the scenes in Uganda and Sudan: the visual description is heart-wrenching. Through the course of the film he becomes sort of a holy warrior for the Sudanese orphans, saving them from the internal system. There, Machine Gun Preacher gets a bunch of brownie points, for making the audience want to consider leaving their own cushioned lives for the betterment of the world. Or at least feel horrible about being privileged. Gerard Butler  gives a stimulating performance, but a confusing one. He's tough, alright. You're afraid of him when he's a violent no-gooder and you want to applaud him for having the nerve to uproot his life - but you cannot, for the life of you, move beyond how he reaches to such situations.I've not read the book that this movie is based on (Childers' memoir Another Man's War) but the film adaption is just too easy. It waters down every other effort that the film makes to create, a visually gripping account of what happens when an eccentric character enters a world that is blocked out.The biggest flaw though, is in Machine Gun Preacher fundamentally conveying through the film that it takes a White American man, in all his power to kill in the name of god, so the ""oppressed"" can see a better life. That is if we get down to analyzing the message of the film. Marc Forster  ceases to bend towards a judgment but you can see it in Butler's demeanor. The film leaves a lot unsaid, and this is a thought that might be considered unnecessary. My question is - couldn't we have done without the politics? Butler needn't have had to move from a psychopath to a half-saint. He could have been a regular guy with a genuine will to help - somehow, in the film you can't decipher if he's helping or assuming a high role of power to massage his own ego. You could watch the film for Butler's performance - just don't attempt to answer the question marks in your head.]"
503,"[A film less than two hours and yet you get bored - that tells you whether or not you should watch the film. But, here go the details, anyway. Bored with the story because it just won't move. Whatever needs to be said about the characters is said in the first 25-30 minutes and that too in slow motion. After that, it's just a wait for the inevitable to happen. Sure, there could have been some interest generated by how it transpires, but not here. There are a few twists leading up to the predictable climax, but what good are twists if you can catch up with them between power naps. No, I didn't sleep, but it'd have been so easy to. Bored with the mostly uni-dimensional characters and the monotonous performances. Jaswant Sisodiya (Manoj Bajpayee) is a egomaniacal political hoodlum you'd love to hate. Manoj Bajpayee does invoke disgust towards Jaswant but you get used to that revulsion towards him soon enough. He also thinks of his obsession for Anju as his love for her. Anju (Tia Bajpai) is the damsel in distress and pretty much stays so. There is no attempt whatsoever to show her pathos except for the one mandatory scrubbing-her-rape-off shower scene. Other than that, it is her silence and voiceover that we have to interpret as sadness. And who knows, maybe you do go dead in face and voice if you've been sexually exploited the way she has been. The third angle in the triangle is that of character-who-is-not-named Arjan Bajwa who enjoys the most layered character of them all and this is not saying much. His demonic anger gets to struggle between gratitude towards Jaswant aka bhai-sahaband empathy for Anju, which in turn makes him, rediscover his human-side. Even though it can be argued that the characters sound interesting, the problem is that what I have said in these two paragraphs is all that there is to them. Add to that the dramatization due to an OD of slow-motion and loud background music.What's a story about women being exploited in the little towns of India without showing too much of the one woman it's talking about let alone a glimpse of other such women? If you haven't evoked an emotion for the protagonist, how can you make me feel anything for the issue?]"
504,"[""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."" But a woman is a woman after all. These are the two lines you are most likely to read in every other review of Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl. A woman is warm and compassionate but you wrong her, and she is capable of making your life hell. But, she will turn back to her warm and compassionate self at the slightest chance. While this is an over-generalization of course and Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl is guilty as charged, I was slightly charmed by the three women representing the three facets of a today's woman - strength in a man's world; old-school simplicity; superficial &amp; so? - and there is a fourth woman who combines the three. Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl started making its way into my good books because the writer spent time in thinking about his women.  But, there is no spark. And no, spark doesn't mean adding absolutely irrelevant songs that bump you out of the stories. The strategy might have worked for Yash Raj Films earlier. But then the music was worth listening to and the choreography and colors were worth being shaken in and out of your film.It's a shame that throughout the first half, I was wondering if a few better known faces for the three women - Dimple, Raina and Saira - would have engaged better. I was thinking about non-top actresses who could've added spunk to the three women's decent performances. They all acted well, but there was something very plain about how their stories came across. It kept bothering me that the stories were interesting, the actors were apt and yet they weren't able to engage me. The mostly basic dialogue is to blame. Except for the lines given to Parineeti Chopra, which were funny and completely in-character, the others were pretty much functional. Parineeti Chopra adds value to it by her comic timing. Also, extra credit to Aditi Sharma and Dipannita Sharma for having done well with the dialogue that they had. There is a lot going on in body language and emotive eyes to convey what was not written. And yet, I can't shake off the feeling that maybe supporting actors from say Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na  or Wake Up! Sid would have added the spirit that is missing. Interestingly, both Ranveer Singh and Anoushka Sharma do nothing new, except maybe show their calendar-photo bodies off. I guess, no one will complain, because nothing major was really being expected from them. Of course, they are two major characters in the film and all that, but you don't come out with a feeling of them being special for the film. In fact, if I hear the twosome utter the word "" partner"" once more, I might mark that against the film, for lack of originality. However, there are a few ""different"" thoughts in the film. I don't use the word ""original"" because I'm sure someone somewhere has done it before. But, there are these sly comments on commercialism and hypocrisy that are brought about in a very casually - a comment about how we don't our Rs.30 wine from our Rs.30,000 wine but are willing to gulp it down, if its packaged in a 5-star environment.  Unfortunately, along with this is the usual problem that goes with any ""con"" film. Everything works out too easily and the climax is usually a cop-out. Add to that predictability, having to ask whether you were just conned into thinking this was a woman's film?]"
505,"[The growth that Marathi cinema has seen over the last few years truly warms my heart. What sets it apart is the fact that there is an inherent honesty in the cinema. Marathi films more often that not capture a certain flavor of life as a Maharashtrian - be it in a rural setting like in Deool or with an urban backdrop like in Hello Jai Hind. I feel delighted when I think of the fact that there is a new Marathi film to watch every week. This week, I had three new releases to choose from. So, when I read, 'Pratibimb is a story that revolves around a newly married couple...' I felt that I didn't need to read further. I had made my choice. What followed was one of the instances in life where one needs to insert a 'note to self'.Pratibimb turned out to be a shockingly amateurish film that was confused about what genre it wanted to belong to, what it really wanted to do to the audience, and in general, what was the point it was trying to make. Any hopes of the aforementioned honesty were dashed in the first five minutes itself, following a poorly performed and executed item song starring Sonali Kulkarni in clothes that reminded one of what Kajol wore in the first half of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, only cheaper. After the said newly married couple get newly married, the newly married wife gets the shock of her life when she discovers that her newly married husband isn't newly married after all - he was married earlier. And what blows the wind out of her windpipe is the fact his first wife, now dead, was an exact replica of her. All of this is revealed in the first ten minutes of the film itself. What follows is a part-horror, part-crime but mostly silly story with inane twists and turns that would make Abbas and Mustan puff their chests up in pride. The film wears an extremely dated look and is very poorly cut. There were times when I was astounded over just how poor the technical aspects of the film were and how such a sub-standard product saw a release in the first place. Now I am not one to hanker over technique when there is an interesting story to tell. The main problem with this film is that the story is so ridiculous that it makes Ready look like Mughal-E-Azam. Touching upon issues like screenplay, characterization and narrative structure, then, would be akin to explaining the nuances of cricket to a Texan.To be fair, the second half of the film had me hooked. I was very eager to know exactly what the inane-ness was leading to. I was, quite literally, on the edge of my seat. A part of me, the unabashed cinema lover, was hoping that the climax of the film would make up for the preceding nonsense, that it would make me sit up straight and say, 'You were trying to make a thriller? Well, I did get thrilled.' Again, note to self.The climax of the film, the reason for why all of the supposed spooky-creepy stuff was happening earlier, is such an insult to one's intelligence that all I wanted after the film was green tea and Casablanca. In other words, I really needed to flush my conscious and sub-conscious.For the actors, there is really nothing much to say. Sonali Kulkarni tries hard but fails. Ankush Choudhary is saddled with the worst role in the film, and there is a strange poetic justice in the way he performs it. Ganesh Yadav, known mainly for his character roles in a number of Hindi films based on the underworld, is competent. So is Ravindra Mankani, a fine actor. The rest of them are, well, there.Bluntly put, Pratibimb was so disappointing that it resulted in what you have read on this page so far. Go figure.]"
506,"[sattaakkk A slap on the audience's face - The Dirty Picture. The lewd men that watch a film just so they can experience Silk's (Vidya Balan) performance are the one's sitting in the audience right now - you and me. Of course, not me as in literally me, because I'm neither a man nor a lesbian. And sure, not all men enjoy a bold woman. But there are enough of us in the audience for whom Silk Smitha starred in 400+ films! And that's just one sex symbol from the 80s. There were others like Nylon Nandini and Polyster Padmini whose lives collectively forms The Dirty Picture's Silk. Even their names make us smirk, and a second later, we snicker at what their personalities stand for. Yet a sizable number from amongst us watch their films. The Dirty Picture is about a woman who not only flaunts what she has, but knows its value and encashes it unapologetically. She has accepted herself. How many women do you know who are absolutely comfortable with who they are? And I haven't even asked about them being comfortable with their sexuality.  In fact, so relaxed is Silk with herself that she makes us uncomfortable. The Dirty Picture is an uncomfortable watch. How can someone be so positive about doing something that is so dark-gray in society, that it's almost black? And she is making the same society, us, dance. Add to this discomfort, the torture of having to watch flab and the female lead's stomach tiers, in the 21st century. Hell, we are even uncomfortable with our bodies. But, Silk is uninhibited and so is the director, Milan Luthria. It's a huge risk to make your female lead look ugly and fat. And to say, ""You want gratuitous skin-show? Here, take it. And here's some more."" You are literally force-fed cleavage to the point that the guy (yes, guy!) sitting behind me said ""It's getting boring now"" when there is a half-naked woman on the screen. Yeah, the second half slips. The first half is breezy and completely entertaining. The second half gets too caught up in showing the pathos that comes with stardom. It does leave you with a ""She came. She got you excited. She left."" But the lull in the second half might be intentional. Because the said pathos however mundane and predictable, needed to be shown. Maybe the line just before the interval is a warning. It's a clever line. And so is almost every line in the film. The dialogue in ""The Dirty Picture"" feels like a twitter timeline composed of extremely witty people. Over-written, maybe, but I thoroughly enjoyed the humor, I laughed out loud, and there were instances when the theater laughed after a pause that it took for the line to register. The wit alone is entertainment enough. I'm not a huge fan of self-referential jokes in our films because they get repetitive. But, The Dirty Picture has one in which it felt like the director has left an extra second or two, like a stand-up comedian, for the audience to ""get"" it. And it works. It's a huge compliment to both Milan Luthria's confidence and the actor's performance, because it meant that he made us forget who he is. Similarly, all your awe for the actor that Naseeruddin Shah is vanishes and you want to slap him for his arrogance and sleaze. Tusshar Kapoor plays a forgettable character, and I mean that as a compliment. Because, his character is meant to be unimportant and he plays it well. Vidya Balan...almost the whole review is a rave about her. She made me feel for a character who I otherwise would have dismissed as characterless.You could see why men would fall for Silk, and not just for her physical boldness. Like films that glamorize underworld dons, she has glamorized our ""sex icons"" from yesteryears and you don't feel squirmy. Instead, you empathize and even convince yourself that they have been victims. Even though every decision they make towards that dark-gray zone of society is a conscious one. Sure, the writing must have its merits for the actors to achieve what they did. But, throughout the film, you feel that you are getting snippets of someone's life, like newspaper cuttings. The flow is missing and you just see glimpses of the layers that make Silk an intriguing person. It also felt like this was done knowingly, to add to the enigma that she is. But, it left me wanting to peel off the mask and see the person behind. A feeling of being told an incomplete story. On the other hand, I'm glad they didn't serve me a sappy backstory. Usually, something lacking in the story would make me recommend a film a little less. But there are other bits in the writing that make up for it in The Dirty Picture. Especially, the climax, not in the way it's played out, but the reason behind why things end the way they do. It's subtle and it flows by swiftly. But it's beautiful and is one of the few things that work in the second half. Again, those shortcomings still do not take away from the bravado it takes to show a plump woman for 150 minutes; the pluck it takes to make cleavage undesirable (okay, maybe I'm taking it too far, but it makes cleavage look like breasts - a regular part of anatomy); the nerve it takes to tell the story of a woman who people look down upon. Surely, the Silk Smithas of the world are smiling in their graves.]"
507,"[I'm always looking forward to stories told by new writer/directors and especially when almost the whole team is fresh. The most known faces in DAM 999 are Ashish Vidyarthi, Rajit Kapoor and Linda Arsenio from Kabul Express. But DAM 999 has a very choppy style of narration to thrill you. That besides, just about everything else takes away from the sort-of, kind-of novel plot point. I saw the English version, so the accents of the Indian actors seemed very affected - Just like the Hindi of a non-Indian sounds in a Hindi film. I know it's a difficult call, but watching Megha Burman exaggerate her Ts and Cs when her character is bred in Kerala(?) and is raised by a south Indian played by Rajit Kapoor who goes to great extent to bring on the South Indian language. I'm discussing the accents in such detail because they act as major distractions and don't allow the characters, which might be well written, to grow on you. Also, they take away from the performances. Even if I let that go, there is another major nuisance glaring at you. 3D. Why? Not one scene, not a single one required the technology. DAM 999 unnecessarily ended up being two shades darker and made me spend those extra Rs.30 on the deposit for the glasses. Every once in a while I took the glasses off and the picture was crystal clear - which means it was actually 2D in play. What a scam, I tell you! And certainly a put-off. The commentary at the beginning of the film alludes to the fact that the story is going to use the 'navarasa' to express various characters. Also, there is some mumbo-jumbo about the nine planets being the forces behind all life. And some other forced use of the number nine to justify the 999 in the title. The story has nothing more to it than a politician controlling everything around him to achieve his political aspirations. The rest, including the entire set-up on the ship, are side-stories that aimed at covering the 999 mentioned above.DAM 999 most certainly took on its plate a lot more than it could chew. 3D, navarasa, 9 planets, 4 languages, politics, social impact of dams, to name a few. The result is a combination of bland actors trying too hard to play out a plot that is all over the place.]"
508,"[Despite very low, if not nil or negative, expectations from Desi Boyz, I had this latent hope that the theme of ""male escorts"" will explore the sexual needs of women - a topic almost untouched in the Hindi film industry. Yes, yes, yes, I'm having a hearty laugh at myself for having this thought even in my subconscious. The joke on me is even bigger considering that the choice of Akshay Kumar should've killed any such hidden wishes. Anyway, that notwithstanding, I did enjoy the few hearty laughs that Desi Boyz gave me and I do concede that it manages to be the ""no brains please"" entertainer that it aims to be.Yet, I cannot keep my heart from breaking at the complete disregard for story and the lousy attempt at having a conflict. There is no peak at which I wonder or care about what's going to happen to Nik (John Abraham) or Jerry (Akshay Kumar). They fight as easily as they make up, amongst themselves, or with their girlfriends. Events occur just because they ""should"" occur rather than flowing organically from one to another. Add to this an unnecessary love guru in the form of Anupam Kher with banal dialogue and scenes that have no connection to the film whatsoever. If the scenes between him and John Abraham were to show some kind of male-bonding, they seemed completely out-of-place. Given that, it is really interesting that though the scenes don't connect with each other, there are a few that work and make you laugh. Omi Vaidya and Bharti Achrekar have you in splits for the little time they are on screen. Their act gave the distinct feeling that a lot many more dialogues would've worked better had there been better performances, especially by John Abraham.But hey, it is clear that John Abraham's job description for this film certainly does not include acting skills. He features in Desi Boyz purely for his worked-out-to-near-perfection body. Deepika Padukone and Chitrangadha Singh do look their usual beautiful selves. I'll do the mandatory by saying that there isn't anything other than looking gorgeous that they are required to do. So much for the women's lib theme, I had thought of. Yep, I'm still beating myself up for having let that thought cross my mind. They dance, they fool around. They make you laugh a little less than they ought to have given some wise cracks that are written for them. And sure, there are a lot many individual lines that could've worked, but the overall plot did nothing at all to engage. The characters are a rather bland variety of ""good at heart, will grudgingly sell their souls for their loved ones"".Desi Boyz talks a bit about friendship, a bit about love, a bit about recession, a bit about doing what's needed to get what you want. And the attempt is to have fun while talking about all of this. But everything is superfluous and a plot that gets you involved is sorely missing. ]"
509,"[Sadrakshanay Khalnigrahanay. Roughly translated as 'Protecting good, destroying evil'. Cynics though we may be, perhaps we could grant that the motto of the Maharashtra Police is simple but elegant. (So what if their official website translates it as ""Protecting The Rightous [sic] And Controlling &amp; Annihilating The Evil"" (sic)?)  Today, on the eve of the third anniversary of 26/11, comes a tribute to the brave yet controversial men who often lay their lives on the line, for you and me. Noted Marathi filmmaker Gajendra Ahire's latest offering, Hello Jai Hind, is a take on the travails and angst of an honest policeman. No, not an 'ACP' or an 'Inspector', but a constable. That man on the lowest rung of the hierarchical ladder of the police force. In cinema, he is generally ignored, often parodied and stereotyped, but never truly done justice to. Not that this film pretends to be a realistic documentary, far from it. Where it succeeds is that it takes a dramatic story and treats it in a manner more honest than most of what we cinephiles have been subjected to lately. Yes, there are flaws. Yes, the film is prone to over-the-top theatrics in moments where subtlety would perhaps have worked better. Yes, the screenplay could and should have been tighter, with a more impactful climax. But in times where the audience's idea of a good cop film is Singham, Hello Jai Hind is a refreshing film.Celebrated art director Nitin Chandrakant Desai makes his acting debut as Shivaji Pawar, an honest man who chose to be a policeman, because that is all he ever wanted to be. While it is quite clear that Desai is not an actor and that he clearly lacks the ability to pull off such a complex role, one can also quite clearly see why he was chosen to play the protagonist - he looks the part. He looks like he could be a constable in the Mumbai police. The gait, the posture, the hair, the physique, everything about him says 'Constable Pawar'.  Performance-wise it is actress (and producer) Trupti Bhoir, as Shivaji Pawar's wife, who steals the show. She is competent, she also looks the part, and she has a presence that always makes you interested in what her character's next move will be. The story is as much hers as it is his. It is tough being a Mumbai policeman's wife, especially a constable's, because the dangers are high and the returns are low. Trupti manages to make us feel that turmoil.They say, 'God is in the details'. That is Gajendra Ahire's big victory in this film. The wife tells her husband, in passing, that instead of a new sari, she would rather save up for a fridge. A few scenes later, when months have passed in their lives, in a long two-shot, unobtrusively parked along a wall stands a small fridge. No attention is drawn to it whatsoever - a sign of a mature filmmaking. What Nitin Desai lacks in the acting department, he makes up for in what he is best at - the art direction. The entire film is set in Mumbai, and the film captures that. The houses, the streets, the rain, everything seems real. Not once do you get the feeling that any location is constructed, even though most of the film is shot on sets. (The only way I got to know that is because I stayed through the end credits, which lists only three locations - N. D. Studio, Film City and Gateway of India.) Also, the sound design and foley work are commendable - they gently ensure that the sounds capture the flavor of Mumbai.A special mention must go to maestro Illaiyaraaja, who has given the music for the film. Few men can come up with melodies that go with the moment or the occasion like the great man, and his music is an asset to this film. Be it the 'Ganpati Ala' track or the songs sung by Sukhwinder, Kailash Kher and Hariharan respectively, the music is from the soul - not the kind that would find its way into iPods across the nation, but the kind which one would not fast-forward while watching on DVD. One only wishes that Illaiyaraaja does more films, even if they are regional or offbeat. The film's other major flaw (apart from Desai's weak performance) is the screenplay. It tends to sag, especially in the latter half of the film. Most importantly, the pre-climax and the climax don't do justice to the buildup. A stronger third act would have truly done wonders to this film. Still, the treatment, the backdrop of real events and its crisp under-two-hour-runtime make the film engaging for the most part. Ultimately, why this film worked for me is that even though it is far from perfect, Hello Jai Hind is honest and it emphatically shows us that Singham is NOT Kingam.]"
510,"[Shakal Pe Mat Ja comes across as a vehicle for one particular person to exhibit everything he has. As if that is not bad enough, each talent that this particular person is show-casing is not worth even commenting on, let alone making a film out of. Shubh Mukherjee has written, directed and is the lead actor. The angles chosen, especially in the beginning of the film, are stylish but are a complete misfit for a comedy that is about four friends who are suspected as terrorists and there are real terrorists lurking around. This one-line description is all you know for most of the first half. Nothing new happens except the same characters repeat the same questions and stories and fart jokes. Actually, the toilet humor is some of the worst - yes, even worse than Delhi Belly. Do people really laugh at urine being sprayed around? Disgusting.For all you know this might be the writer/director's tribute/reference to the film. Because there are enough number of those strewn through the film - each one of them contrived, painful and out-of-place. In fact, the writing is abysmal for a comedy. There might be a spot or two that make you smile because the silliness is getting too out-of-hand. The actors are all loud without exception - even after you've accepted that the genre supposedly demands raw noise. Shakal Pe Mat Ja is a tiring experience at twenty minutes over two hours. It is one of those films that you don't know where to start your complains]"
511,"[Watching a tiny little girl reach out in glee at bubbles that are heading towards her is a joy that is special enough. But when this happens inside a darkened cinema hall and the tiny little girl is wearing 3-D glasses, the feeling is quite simply something else.George Miller's Happy Feet 2, the sequel to the Academy Award-winning Happy Feet (also directed by Miller) is a fun children's film that is immensely helped by the 3-D. In fact, not since Avatar has 3-D contributed so much to a film. At last, someone seems to have realized that if you don't get the feeling that the characters and the action are right in front of you, there really isn't a point in releasing the film in 3-D.Apart from the thoroughly enjoyable 3-D experience, the film is quite easily stolen by the Brad Pitt and Matt Damon-voiced characters Bill the Krill and Will the Krill. Though they aren't the central characters in the film, the interwoven portions featuring these two Krill who 'swim against the swarm' are genuinely funny, with quirky and enjoyable animation. Their antics are often reminiscent of the legendary Scrat from the Ice Age series. The dialogue of the film is goofy and witty, particularly the portions involving Bill and Will. You can't help but smile when Will rattles on about dancing providing 'momentary relief from the existential terrors of existence'. However, the film is majorly let down by its central story about Mumble the Penguin (voiced by Elijah Wood) and his family. Not nearly as charming as the first film, Happy Feet 2 tries to pack in too much into too little time, ultimately making it seem like a mishmash of a number of animation films that have come out of Hollywood. While there are a host of endearing characters including Ramon, voiced excellently by Robin Williams and Sven, voiced by Hank Azaria, the plot of the film just doesn't engage you enough to root for the central characters. Like the first film, this too is a musical, and there are a couple of well-crafted musical set pieces that are fun while they last. At the core of the film is a father-son story that feels quite unexplored. The film would have appealed far more if this core idea was used to anchor the film, instead of having a whole host of sub-plots that just deviate from what had the potential to be a heart-warming tale of a son who grows to respect his father for the man (or penguin) that he is. What really works against the film is that it packs in too many messages and tries too hard to convey these messages. Thus, the audience is repeatedly subjected to characters coming to terms with and accepting themselves for what they are, to the importance of family, to environmental messages and so on. No surprise then that the film ends up becoming a tad too preachy for its own good.  Ultimately, while the film is a fun watch for children and the 3-D is genuinely thrilling, how one wishes that the makers of the film had chosen to narrate a simpler, cleaner tale that would have genuinely 'brought out our happy'. ]"
512,"[Paulwaat quite instantly makes one feel that though it isn't particularly novel or brave, the film has an honest story. However, apart from the fact that it is technically quite amateurish, the film's biggest problem is that director Aditya Ingale just fails to inject the same honesty into the film's treatment.The story, in spite of being nowhere close to new, does strike a chord. A young, middle-class man leaves a settled job and comes to Mumbai, that grand merchant of dreams, to pursue his artistic aspirations - familiar to most and to some like me, intensely personal. The film then traces the struggles that follow and the relationships he crafts along the way.The 'struggle' is a concept that the protagonist, Anant, knows he has to go through, but somehow doesn't seem to fully understand. At times this seems like a deliberate character trait. There are times, however, when it appears that the character just wasn't developed enough.The relationships that he gradually forges also give the feeling that they aren't explored completely. Chief amongst these is the one he shares with his spirited landlady - a tough-as-nails, no-nonsense woman with a sad past and a tender heart. Then there is Usman bhai, a veteran classical musician who has seen only struggle throughout his journey of life. Their stories, though touching, seem like pages from an incomplete book.Technically, the film leaves a lot to be desired. The shot-taking and cutting are often plain shoddy. The lead actor Subodh Bhave (playing Anant) doing a fairly decent job. The rest of the cast lends adequate support. The music is mostly functional, sometimes pleasant, but never memorable. The highlight of the music is a soulful song sung by Asha Bhosale, my personal favourite playback singer.Then, of course, there is the lack of attention to detail. Even though the entire film is set in Mumbai, nearly 80% of it seems to be shot elsewhere, something that is extremely conspicuous. The silhouette shots of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link that appear at intervals are simply not enough. Usman bhai, who is supposed to be a Hindi-speaking Muslim character hailing from the North of India, seems distinctly not Muslim and not  North Indian. While such details are important in cinema, they are still at a superficial level. This film's biggest problem lies far deeper.For a struggling artist/performer who is new to Mumbai, one of the biggest factors contributing to the struggle is the city itself. It is a hard place to live in, even harder to make a mark in. Thousands of dreams are swept into oblivion every single day. When you use public transport and have to travel all over the city to show your work to the men holding the puppet strings, it takes a physical and emotional toll on you. These little details needed to be woven into the film at a visual level so subtly that they would gently creep into the subconscious of the viewer. That is what contributes to a soul-stirring cinematic experience, and that is what is sorely lacking in this film. The fact, then, that local trains don't find even a cursory mention in the film can easily be forgiven.In the end, Paulwaat ends up being like that ordinary cup of coffee you have some mornings. It does the job that it was meant to do, but it doesn't nearly satisfy you.]"
513,"[When a little middle-class boy with big dreams in his eyes proclaims that he wants to make films, the first gentle rebuke he will probably hear is, 'So, you want to be Spielberg?' Such is the influence of the man - a man praised and criticized in equal measure. However, irrespective of which side of the fence you are on, there is no denying that few men have had the kind of influence on any facet of human history, as Steven Spielberg has had in the field of audio-visual entertainment. Spielberg's latest, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, is exactly that - an entertaining  film that is perhaps the closest that a big-screen adaptation has come so far, in capturing the essence of some of the most endearing and enduring comic book characters of all time.That Tintin, Captain Haddock, Snowy, and of course, Thomson and Thompson will bring a smile on your face is a given. Their quirks, their dialogue and their 'unquenchable thirst for adventure' have been brought alive by producers Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson in a revolutionary new way.Motion capture combined with incredible detailing in VFX brings the animation to life in a manner never seen before. Every reflection, every droplet of water, every tiny movement of human hair is unbelievably life-like. Only the characters' faces (and at times their actions) betray that what one is viewing is indeed animation.Be it an incredible mid-sea battle amidst a raging inferno or a superb bike chase through the streets and homes of Morocco, the film is riddled with enthralling set-pieces that will make more than a few jaws drop. The film is rich in colour and more importantly, it is rich in atmosphere - something that goes a long way in sucking the audience in to the story. John Williams' music score more than plays its part in enriching the atmosphere that the film manages to create.While the 3D in this film isn't as big a waste as it has been in so many films, one still suspects that watching the film in 2D will not detract from the visual experience in any way. If anything, the colours are bound to be richer once the dark glasses are off.The department that the film suffers the most in is the script. The mystery itself isn't as mysterious as one would have liked. The twists and turns are there, but there is really nothing that will make you sit at the idiomatic edge of your seat. However, the quirkiness of the characters, particularly Captain Haddock, makes up in part for the deficiencies in the script. The characters keep you entertained at all times.Yes, that aspect which Spielberg is criticized the most for is present all over this film - the manner in which it is moralistically sanitized. The edginess, the layers, the nuances of real human behavior and the shades of grey that someone who is not a Tintin or an animation fan would want are noticeably absent. This is the one area where this film would fall behind iconic Pixar films like Finding Nemo, Toy Story and Wall-E. Ultimately, The Adventures of Tintin is an entertaining film for children as well as adults, particularly those who enjoy animation. The realistic animation is a visual treat, and there would be few who would not feel an adrenaline rush at least once during the film. Make no mistake, as far as animation technique in cinema is concerned, the envelope has been pushed. Even we who feel that audio-visual entertainment and cinema are often worlds apart would have to agree.]"
514,"[""Pursuit of happiness"" and ""right vs. wrong"" are the difficult existential themes Rockstar grapples with. It entails defining happiness, defining right and wrong. Rockstar's ambition is to talk about one of the loveliest paradoxes - in order to pursue happiness, you have to be unhappy. Rockstar also wants to be an epic, romantic tragedy - Greek / Shakespearean / Devdas to Laila-Majnu to the protagonist's namesake  - take your pick. Rockstar is that, but it leaves too many gaping holes for comfort. I'm not asking for a water-tight thriller type answers, but I cannot suppress simple questions like - there are an awfully large number of talented people out there, why is Janardhan aka JJ aka Jordan or as we like to call him Ranbir Kapoor given so much leeway despite his obnoxious self. I understand him getting away with it once he is popular, but when he is a nobody? Just because he is willing to sign some agreements? This in a world full of talented soul-sellers - I mean both in their skill/art and selling their soul. I need to understand why his lady love hasn't heard of this concept called divorce - the involved families seemed open-minded enough.In a film that is trying to transcend into another world, these questions might seem only mechanical. Having to answer them might be mere hindrances in the larger purpose of going beyond...to that field where right and wrong have no meaning. But then, the writer, Imtiaz Ali should've gone all the way and made it a film in which these questions didn't come to me - a film in which I'd absorb abstractism without any qualm. Don't put in a silly and out-of-place bhabhi (sister-in-law). Don't put in a forced reason for the protagonist to be thrown out of his house. And please don't suddenly put in a rebellious song with a social commentary just because you had an awesome lyricist and the world's greatest music composer at your disposal. Your character, Jordan is least bothered with the environment and such. Maybe all films about rockstars have to show the star's angst against ""society"", symbolically and literally, which they dole out with brilliantly choreographed cinematography. But then all rockstars dope it up and you did avoid that, didn't you? Because there was no room for that in the story, just like there was no room for the said song in the film. Thankfully, the rest of the songs weave in and out of the film making it a beautiful musical. And a beautiful musical it is. Given the Himalayas and Prague are its locations, I doubt there is anything a cinematographer or a director could have done wrong. And I doubt it'd bother too many of us for too long if the songs weren't picturized too well. We'd rant about it, and pop in a CD and listen to the music anyways, over and over again. The good thing is the film doesn't become all about the beauty of these places or only about the music. The not-so-good thing is that it doesn't become much about anything else either. While you do feel for Jordan, it is solely because Ranbir Kapoor is desperately injecting life into the scattered screenplay with Jordan's plain and simple pain and unabashed self-destruction. I usually refrain from giving my suggestions on the changes that I'd have liked in the film, because that means I'm talking about a different film altogether. But, here, I can't resist wondering what Rockstar would've been like if it was neat and clean, linear. It'd have to be shorter for sure. The non-linearity didn't bother me per se, I just found it unnecessary and taking away from the plot. It didn't let the protagonists' suffering build up. Especially that of the lead lady, Heer. I'm going to go out on a limb and say the gorgeous looking, hot (even in loose, traditional Kashmiri wear) Nargis Fakhri is a mistake. The 'new in films' discomfort is visible. Her comic timing is way off and she manages to mess the few good lines and situations in the first half. (then the writer give up on coming up with any original lines). Anyway, maybe we just have to wait for her to open up like Kareena Kapoor or Katrina Kaif. But the damage is done to the film at hand. Her inability to emote either her suppressed wild-side, her dilemma, or her physical frailty are the main weak link of Rockstar. The back-and-forth screenplay I would have been able to handle, if I felt my heroine's agony. I didn't connect to her and therefore his love and lust for her. The scarier thing is I got a feeling that the director was treating his film with a one-arm distance too, almost wary that he might get too attached to his baby. I know many of you are keen, but I really don't see as many of us enjoying this one for what it is. Yes, yes, this recommendation is after discounting for high expectations. ]"
515,"[The opening 20 minutes of Ghajini-director A. R. Murugadoss's latest offering, the Surya-starrer 7 aum Arivu, made me smile like few other films in the recent past have.Set just centuries after Christ in ancient India and China, the film opens almost like a documentary on the origins of the Shaolin clan. Ravi K. Chandran's cinematography in these portions can only be described as stunning. Every grain on the surface of the film stock used seemed to have been milked for whatever it was worth, to produce some exquisite shots, used primarily in montage. How much of it was actually post-production would make an interesting topic for a debate though.With the arresting visuals, impressive production and VFX, and a unique concept with roots in history, the opening reels of the film laid a promising foundation for a smart, action-packed sci-fi thriller. Thereafter, however, the film nosedives into mediocrity like Ra.One's second week box-office collections.Still, I couldn't shake the first twenty minutes of the film from my head even hours after the screening. That the Tamil film industry is technically at par with and organizationally miles ahead of its Hindi counterpart is no secret. But I couldn't stop wondering that if the diminutive, almost inconsequential looking Murugadoss could have the vision to execute what I saw in the initial reels of 7 Aum Arivu, what stops the Hindi film industry from doing the same? Once the film shifts to the present, it begins to meander around pointless songs, embarrasses the scientific community with hare-brained theories about genetic engineering and descends into near-right wing Tamil pride preachiness. Along the way, it also finds time to have Chinese people speak English in an accent that would make people believe that the 'Britishers' in Sanjay Khan's Tipu Sultan were actually from Britain.If there is anything that all that marginally redeems the film in its entirety, it is Surya. He exudes a charm and genuineness that many Indian viewers are not used to seeing. Add to this the fact that he dances like a dream and is supremely confident doing any kind of action. Surya is, quite simply, a star. Surprisingly, even Shruti Haasan is a revelation in this film. She looks ethereal in Indian clothes, is extremely camera friendly, and seems to have had absolutely no problem dubbing for herself in Tamil. 7 Aum Arivu will go a long way in erasing memories of her in that disaster named Luck. The man playing Dong Lee, the Chinese villain, also does his bit. He is expectedly good in action and looks menacing enough. Which brings us back to the basic problem plaguing this, and indeed most films today - the writing. Mediocre at best and downright shoddy at its worst, some of the dialogues are just cringe-worthy. I fail to understand why week after week, audiences get to witness films that could have been, but are not.  While Murugadoss needs to be lauded for selecting such a new subject for a film, his treatment of it needs serious criticism. Understandably, he had to make the film palatable to primarily the Tamil audience. How one wishes though, that commercial pressures would not figure so highly on the list of priorities for Indian filmmakers.All said and done, I walked away from the cinema hall feeling a tad bit impressed. While they don't venture too deep into cinematic waters, Tamil filmmakers like Murugadoss and Shankar (Endhiran, Sivaji - The Boss) show hints of a vision that Hindi cinema seems to sorely lack. 7 Aum Arivu, though an overall letdown, is not a complete waste of your time primarily because of this vision.]"
516,"[I could watch Deool just the play of light and shade in each of its frame. And this is even more amazing considering the film is set in a village where many a time there's no electrical power and the only source of light is an oil lamp or sometimes just the stars and the moon. Even if I didn't realize how beautiful it is shot, I could watch it just for the village simpletons. Their faces and bodies so expressive, these are true actors each one of them, as if there was no camera in front of them, and I was just observing people from a village where my grandparents live. And yet, Deool has so, so much to offer. So what if it is a little less metaphorical than director, Umesh Kulkarni's earlier venture and so what if it had a couple of avoidable ""commercial"" elements? I enjoyed the ride that Deool took me on. Deool is about the transformation of Mangrul, a village in the remotest interiors of Maharashtra. It is a satirical journey of Mangrul's belief in religion and the blind faith that accompanies it. And Mangrul is only a representation of the common population, us. Deool argues about the definition of development in a village that is so behind that basic necessities like water and electricity are missing in action. Is it so bad then if the village gets these simple needs by using blind faith as a stepping stone? Though I'm not sure Deool stays non-judgmental it sure does a good job of presenting both sides. Deool talks about capitalism and business in religion; it showcases the strength of women and at the same time the hypocrisy of the political system all in one breath. And all of this is narrated fluidly. The sedentary village and its laid-back residents go from one event to another and before you realize that you know the characters and their quirks, their intentions and motivations. This is as much a result of the immaculate dialogue-writing as it is the way/dialect in which it's delivered. And this is even though I watched a non-subtitled version. I surely must've missed out on a few punch lines. The actors take entertainment to the next level. Even the exaggerated tones seem acceptable because they make you laugh so hard. There were at least a couple of scenes where my mouth was wide open because of the ridiculous way in which things were unfolding - because I knew this could so happen in my village too. There were a few other scenes which created beautiful and/or insightful moments. I especially enjoyed the exchanges between Nana Patekar and Dilip Prabhavalkar. Mentioning just these two names is a huge disservice to the rest of the cast, but the list is so long and every villager that comes on screen leaves an impression. Let me also quickly add that there were a couple of scenes where Nana Patekar overdid it. But, that hardly took away from the film. That doesn't mean that there were no eliminable elements at all because at 2.5 hours, Deool is a little too long. Also a tad disappointing is the introduction of ""commercial"" elements in an Umesh Kulkarni film. Is Umesh succumbing? Because it is not only about an item number and a cameo by a ""bigger"" Hindi actor. Those we can, this once, grant benefit of doubt to, under the cloak of ""the need of the script"". But, he also seems to have gone that extra mile to explain the metaphors and not left it to his usual subtle style. But hey, I don't mind a little commerce with my art. Deool in many ways is Valu - Part 2. It carries the same tone and texture AND it leaves a tiny ""not as good as"" the first part feel. Yet, it is a wholesome and entertaining experience.]"
517,"[Loot starts out the same old plot with four wannabe thugs setting out to loot something or the other. They are four but are almost alike when it comes to characteristics and quirks. They are loud, they crack wannabe jokes, they objectify women and sing and dance for no good reason. Their world is full of thugs and they encounter only their kind even when they go into a new world. And slowly Loot has a couple of twists and it becomes marginally interesting mainly because you weren't expecting a story to be thrown at you. I actually felt grateful even though the story is too convoluted to hold that interest for too long. But let's just better than nothing, it surely was.Loot also came across as a confused film because the acting and the dialogue were your run-of-the-mill slapstick, but the texture, the tone of the film is classier and the overall plot has a little more meat than usual.Loot is one of those films that you could stop by while flipping channels, ridicule the non-sense going on on-screen, get frustrated that you can't make sense of it and move on. ]"
518,"[Miley Naa Miley Hum is a launch vehicle for politician, Ram Vilas Paswan's son Chirag Paswan and unfortunately stays just that - carrying on its arms tropy heroine, Kangna Ranaut, of course. The basic plot had the charm to be a warm family film but ends up being a bland, predictable affair, especially post interval.Chirag Paswan looks sincere but has a long way to go before his face and body learn how to convey what his character feels/wants to say. And I appeal to all dialogue writers, please, please stop giving Kangna Ranaut English lines - pronouncing ""career"" as ""carrier"" I'd let go, but ""means"" as ""mince"", please have mercy on us! The two saving graces of this otherwise almost debacle are Poonam Dhillon and Kabir Bedi's voice. Actually, Kabir Bedi has a couple of scenes in which his eyes express everything that his otherwise dead expression don't convey throughout the film. The basic plot is interesting but with the ridiculous twist midway, it has no surprises or believability left. Had they somehow masked that twist and if there was some chemistry between the lead pair there was half a chance for Miley Naa Miley Hum to be a decent film.Alas, its just another one of those films that you'll stop at in your channel-surfing mode, just to check out what Ram Vilas Paswan's son looks like. ]"
519,"[What does it say about a film if you can't shake off the feeling that it is only a vehicle for the mother (Hema Malinito re-launch her daughter (Esha Deol), just like the father (Dharmendra) keeps doing that for his sons (Bobby Deol and Sunny Deol). Watch the closing song which is about Esha and not Tanya, the character she plays! I doubt even Salman Khan's item appearance here can do the trick though. Someone needs to tell the family, that its not working. They should all move into side-character roles soon, if they are going to stick to acting that is. They don't look good, they don't emote well. Anyway so, what does it say about the film if you can't shake off the feeling that Tanya is looking for her biological parents only so that she can go to different exotic locations with her boyfriend and friend who is a boy? It tells you a lot when you are constantly aware of the biological relationships between the crew of a film while watching it. Tell Me O Khuda fails to engage, it fails to make you identify with its characters, it fails to keep you interested through the duration of the film. The only good thing that can be said about the film is that the protagonist sets out on an interesting journey. But the narrations is so lackluster, that even though she turns into an activist and a psychologist on the way, you don't feel like laughing at it. And for that one good thing, I cannot ask you to watch the film even if its playing on TV, while skimming through channels may be you can stop for a bit. But, that's about it. ]"
520,"[Ra.One's first-day-first-show was reviewed by wogma's guest reviewer Pradeep Menon here. Thank you so much, Pradeep for doing this for wogma. I was off for Diwali with family and saw the film a couple of days later. Here's how I liked Ra.One. * Ra.One works as a brilliant film for kids. And I say that with no sarcasm at all. From the time I heard the premise of the film, it gave a very children's film vibe. Of course, for the fear of alienating most of its audience, Ra.One couldn't be marketed as a kids film. But, in this day and age where being nice is not ""cool"" enough, Ra.One goes on to show what happens when you try to mess with the ""good &gt; evil"" formula. Or like Pradeep said, ""it tries"".It is only an attempt because the moral of the story is very functional, very shallow. When a woman who loves her husband, grieves only perfunctorily, using a two-minute song as a medium AND is ready to look all shiny and hot for the next party number, you can barely care for the character who just died. As an adult, I wonder, whether it was the right lesson in morals at all. But as a child, one could be more forgiving and focus on the job at hand - kill the villain and cheer up.The movie-lover in me takes this lack of warmth in stride and focuses on how a film made for entertainment allows a dark event like death to happen. That and all the slick action at a swift enough pace that I didn't get bored in a two-and-a-half-hour film with a fifteen-minute ad-filled interval. That is a huge plus for me who wants every minute beyond the 100-105 minute mark to count.While all the action is executed by a team that is obviously the best in its field, the writing is mediocre - both the dialogue and the overall story. The film tries too hard to be funny, and almost all the ""one-liners"" fall flat. The non-funny, supposedly emotional/inspirational lines are ""bleh"". The only line that stayed with me as a powerful statement was said by Ra.One the villain, which can also be heard in the promos. And I wish I had more of that, and also more of Ra.One, the character. I was supposed to fear him only because my protagonist feared him, not because there was anything menacing about him. And I can't blame actor, Arjun Rampal, the story itself didn't have any sub-plots or events that exposed anything loathsome about him. I need something powerful, if I'm supposed to hate a software program, right? It could also be because the only thing at threat is a little boy's life. It isn't as if the earth is being destroyed by aliens or world peace is at stake. And there isn't anything extra endearing about the little boy or his gorgeous mother Kareena Kapoor for me to feel the fear on his behalf. Instead, all we get is mumbo-jumbo in the name of how this game really works? We have a villain that has the power to take control over others' mind, and the writers couldn't think of intense situations for us to see his power. There is the one scene with Kareena Kapoor, but that comes across as a device to give her some more screen time with a different expression, than anything else. The climax is lame, but what it leaves is an interesting premise for a sequel, but of course, it will need some out-of-this-world writing to make good use of it. The one thing that comes as a pleasant surprise because it didn't happen is that Shah Rukh Khan doesn't fill every frame. Also, he doesn't ham and go all Shah Rukkkkhy on us, though he loses his Tamil accent way too often. There is one scene in which his character Shekhar is scared out of his wits, I forgot he's The SRK, I was taken over by Shekhar's fear and confusion over what's happening - absolutely un-hero like, and certainly non-star like. There are these little elements that make the film likeable. There isn't much to take home, but the 2.5 hours spent in the theater are not all bad. There are sequences in the film that made me miss my kids. I know where one will laugh out loud, and when the other will clench my hand with fear. Yes there's a lot of juvenile humor which I'm giving my kids two more years to snap out of.  I'm surely going to test my hypothesis out, not that I have a choice, for they both want to watch the movie, I've had to make a promise, ""Even if you don't like it, mamma"" :D I'll surely update this space if there are any interesting observations. Till then, a very Happy Diwali to all of you. And once again, thank you Pradeep for doing a wogma review on day 1. ]"
521,"[Have you ever noticed, that being around people younger than you, brings a spring in your step, makes you take life a little less seriously and deservedly so. Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge makes you spend two hours with regular yet vibrant twenty-one year-olds. And I don't know about that spring in the step, but it surely leaves a warm, mushy feeling. And despite all the predictability, the sharp dialogue and interesting characterization are good enough to make it worth the trip to the theaters. There is only so much new that you can have in a girl-meets-boy story - somebody has to fall in love with somebody or someone has to live without someone . There is only that much more new you can expect from comic situations - there will be mistaken identities, there will be puns, there will be an attempt to infuse everyday, colloquial humor in the said situations and puns. Even if you come up with more such situations, hardly anything is going to be novel. The devil then lies in the details. And Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge does a wonderful job of getting the mini-situations in the situations, right. The lines are clever, they are delivered smartly and with control. Some of the back and forth between characters is so quick, that you miss what is told. Not the annoying hurried, quick. The kind of pacy dialogue that makes you sure, that you missed something good, given the tone of the film. Full credit to the almost brand new cast. From the main foursome, to the character roles - they are all played out well. I completely enjoyed Saqib Saleem and Saba Azad's performances. They annoy and entertain appropriately. Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge sticks to the genre it picks. It is not setting out to say anything profusely profound, but in its little way, it leaves around little quotable quotes and witticisms. Though the film never says it out loud, the overall impact is that - love is beyond a ""hot"" body and online personas. The next logical step is a story about how outdoor sports scores over the online ""dhishoom-dhoosh!""Of course, there is the underlying assumption that most urban romances are online rather than offline. We can argue about whether this is true or not, but the point is having made that assumption, the writers have a story to tell. They tell it well, and the director ably guides the youthful spirit of the story. In this particular case, the well-paced narration and the slick editing has a lot to add to the fresh feel of the film. The songs needed to have a little more zing. Except for the ""dhyaun dhyaun"" song, they are all pretty lame. But, they are again, elevated by the way they are edited. So brisk is the movement that you don't feel like you are listening to something average. Yes, I gladly take back all the nasty things I had to say after seeing the promo of the film. A decent film is so worth having to eat my words. Do I have a choice, considering a predictable boy-meets-girl story, with an unexplained transformation in character, created a string of moments that brought a tear to me eye?]"
522,"[As regular as boy-meets-girl stories are becoming common for the regular movie-watcher, the spate of dark comedies and noir is becoming for the quirky movie-watcher. Interestingly, the same analogy applies to mindless comedies. You need to put your brain away to watch a Priyadarshan comedy or a David Dhawan film, almost as much as you need to keep your gray cells at bay to give up on the number of coincidences required to make a ""separate threads collide"" story. Only difference is that the latter has a zing in both cases, just because of the quirky treatment. And My Friend Pinto is just that amount of quirky, no more, no different. Just average in its genre.It's not like there isn't enough meat in those disconnected threads or how they are played out. It is fun and cute, but it deviates from the chosen narrative-style a little way too often. What are pillow fights and people romantically flying in clouds doing in a film with the most unlikely underworld dons. These dons they are rather eccentric as required by this type of films, but the portrayal is too cartoon-ish, too amateur to make an impact. The actors don't seem to help the cause either, the show very easily and a little too often slips into slapstick mode. Prateik Babbar is the protagonist, the village fool, the grown-up man who never grew up. And we are being treated to a night in his life where the craziest things happen to him. This one required no ""performance"" by him, he looked like the dumb/naive person he plays in most other films  (other than Jaane Tu...). Kalki Koechlin barely has a role to play. I really liked her in the one song that she has with Prateik Babbar. That song has also been picturised very well. Watch out for the choreographed water splashing. It's an awesome visual.Other than that My Friend Pinto, is as regular as it gets in the movies we can directly compare it to. We, of course, have seen worse films in general, but in this bracket, whatever My Friend Pinto has to show is covered, and whatever it has to say is too wishy-washy for the kind.]"
523,"[Azaan opens out like a Polish war film. Both stylish and serene. And the slick execution continues well into the film. The style in writing can also be seen with the main characters playing mind games with each other. But, unfortunately, none of it is taken deeper. These things which do make the first half of the film interesting, stay at the surface, or rather as a check mark in the list of to-dos. Action - check, emotional drama - check, romance - check. The romance is draining the viewer's resources of patience. And this is despite the fact that the romantic angle is an integral part of the story and how it culminates. So, even though I understand why it is necessary, I don't feel like tolerating it. And this is despite a very beautiful Candice Boucher. The missing ingredient is context. Romance has to be a little more than the lead lady catwalking her wardrobe over a couple of songs on beaches. Sachiin Joshi is not very inspiring either. I understand, his character, Azaan is grim and serious and he actually has no reason to emote anything else. But, there must be something about his personality or the character's traits that makes me want to watch his story for two hours. I loved the fact that the dialogue was minimalist. There are long silences and a lot of reactions are with expression alone. It adds to the mystery of the characters and the plot. The story by itself is something we have seen in non-Indian cinema earlier. But not too much has been done in the area of bio-terrorism and more importantly the psyche of terrorists hasn't been talked about a lot in our cinema. That in addition to the proper use of action is a gaping hole. Usually Hollywood action is aped just for the sake of action. In Azaan it is executed appropriately. Hence, I'm willing to let go a lot that goes wrong in the second half of the film. If I were a teacher, I'd give extra points to Azaan for effort. And do we give leeway for improvement over director, Prashant Chadha's last endeavor, Aap Ka Suroor?]"
524,"[Mod takes its time to establish the characters and settle in. Meanwhile, as an audience you are absorbing the atmosphere of this little town named Ganga, where everyone knows everyone. You follow Ayesha (Ayesha Takia) as she goes about her daily routine and unknowingly you know so much about her life from just exposure to one day in her life. That ""unknowingly"" bit is the power of good story-telling.Without realizing it, I knew and grew fond of Ayesha, a strong-headed woman, which is so important to register as the story moves on. Also, the combination of Ayesha Takia's cute, baby(?) face with the will of a girl who had to take care of herself from a very young age, make Ayesha (the character) even more likeable. Ayesha Takia portrays this girl with all her nuances - the fear, distrust, sure-headedness, uncertainties, feeling of being loved - she covers them all. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Rannvijay Singh. I wouldn't say he disappointed, casting him wasn't fair to such a strongly written character. On the other hand, maybe a few films and characters later, he'd have been ready for this one. A mentally unstable character is not an easy role to play for anyone. That the illness wasn't dramatized or glamorized was what endeared me to Mod. I'm pretty sure, some of the situations and reactions shown in the film are not medically correct, yet the entire story had an emotional angle to it which draws you to the story and its outcome. Mod is a strong, serious story told with sensitivity and conviction. Welcom back, Mr. Kukunoor. How much ever, I like experimentation, I'm glad you are done with it, or at least are on a break. ]"
525,"[Don't ever watch a Wong Kar Wai film, if you're going to text while it plays or pause it periodically. His films are not meant for the passive viewer - and if you still don't take my advice, you'll end up with a film that, to you, was an intercutting string of incoherent perspectives. Multiple viewings and a proactive ongoing analysis is necessary to truly enjoy the layers, symbolism and quirks of his narrative.Being in that kind of a mood, I picked up one of his older films, Days of Being Wild. It's a convoluted story about multiple characters dealing with longing and rejection. Mostly, we see a set of complex endings of even more complex relationships. We start with Yuddy (Leslie Cheung) a handsome man, who would also be known as a smooth ladies' man. He manages to move between women, unintentionally breaking their hearts, but we also realize soon enough that this instability stems from the fact that he is an adopted son to a prostitute mother. He salvages the complexities of his oedipal complex by letting his relationships center around him - while they flow, erupt, and tangle. Through this, we enter the world of Su Lizhen (Maggie Cheung) a shy general store worker, who gets most affected by his mannerisms.She develops a silent, fragile relationship with a local policeman (Andy Lau) as a backup for her broken heart, while we see Yuddy fall in love with a cabaret dancer called Mimi (Carina Lau) - who secretly loves Yuddy's best friend Zeb (Jacky Cheung). All this is set at the backdrop of Yuddy's love-hate relationship with his mother. You may wander to deduce that this string of intricate liaisons originates with the mother-son duo - but soon enough Wong Kar Wai creates a different stream for each story. Days of Being Wild isn't plot heavy, but the story unfolds as each facet of our characters are revealed. There's a sense of thematic ambiguity - where Wai doesn't reveal his choice to portray this particular ensemble of stories - but it's in this ambiguity that we realize each person is bound by their desire. Wong Kar Wai's unique visual approach is evident with Days of Being Wild - he fixates on one scene, one character long enough to establish a narrative. Effortlessly, and with very simple cinematography, he bases his complex thematic structures and characters and lets you as a viewer, live the narrative. His background music, acts as a catalyst in forming a jumbled, kaleidoscopic world in your head. The DVD of Days of Being Wild has no extras, no features and not even a trailer. It was a bit of a letdown - and this is a recurring trend in all Wong Kar Wai DVDs, where you only get the film. The subtitles options are aplenty, though - Spanish, French, English and Japanese. Days of Being Wild is charming. It's not a positive film, and it won't leave you with particularly simplistic thoughts by the end of it - so be warned. But it's a charming visual tale, of an assortment of people who deal with basic human emotions in their own personal manner. Watch it not to relate, detach or deduce from the complexities - but just to let the narrative tease your intelligence and play with your head. ]"
526,"[Love Breakups Zindagi has very deliberately written and made film. You can see the thought put in the growth of the characters and their interactions. Unfortunately, the makers aren't able to build momentum soon enough. They take too long to establish the chemistry between various characters and it ends up being a little too slow.Unfortunately, this happens because they are trying to imitate life. It takes time to establish friendships and romantic relationships. The little things that attract people to each other take their own sweet time to reveal themselves. Real people give a lot of thought before breaking up with their partner and it is a tough decision. But, there are times when the slow pace works in a film and there are times when it doesn't. In Love Breakups Zindagi it mostly doesn't. Sadly, it is not for lack of trying. I really like the simple theme picked to make the film about, ""Opposites attract, but choose a like-minded partner"" but ironically, the simplicity makes it too dull. The effort is visible. The restraint in spending about 30-45 minutes of a film in a wedding set-up and keeping it quite is visible and I actually appreciate it too. But, the dialogue is too plain and thus too boring. Maybe, if the film were left to better actors, it would have pepped the film up a bit. But, Zayed Khan just doesn't work as a romantic hero. Every time he tries to emote a sentimental emotion, he brings a cringe. Dia Mirza is good as the confused girl who wants to do the right thing, but there is nothing special about her. Cyrus Sahukar has an effected dialogue delivery, the words don't flow. Tisca Chopra is the only one who looks competent and fit for her role, but then again this must be a cake walk for her. I usually, avoid talking about cameos, but here Shah Rukh Khan's special appearance brings about a very real, very believable reaction from Naina (Dia Mirza). It is adorable. But other than that the cameo, like most cameos, is dispensible. And that hurts because the biggest culprit in Love Breakups Zindagi's failure is the length. Had these cameos been chopped off, had a couple of side-stories been taken away, the film would be a crisper product rather than a limp one, which you are most likely to watch among many other things while flipping channels. Love Breakups Zindagi is one of those cases where rating it as ""watch if you have nothing better to do"" sounds a bit too harsh. It doesn't have laugh out loud or super-aawwww moments. But it is sweet and it does have a few relatable insights about relationships. But you have to be a very patient person to enjoy them.]"
527,"[Rascals' main aim seems to demean and mock. You know, the kind of jokes that are cracked on the less fortunate and are politically incorrect - be it the poor or the blind. The other kind of humor involves guys ogling at cleavage - what is that actually supposed to do? Make you laugh, titillate you, warm you up to the owner of the cleavage? Speaking of which, my hands started hurting with the number of times Kangna Ranaut is pulled from Sanjay Dutt by Ajay Devgn only to be pulled right back by Sanjay Dutt. Imagine the number of times they must've done that while shooting those pulling-and-pushing scenes. And the forced hugs that Kangna Ranaut gets from Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgn after she is pulled makes the two heroes of the film look like lecherous, sleazy, old men that any woman would avoid with a barge pole. Why then is she tolerating this nonsense? There's a reason for it all, supposedly. A reason that only makes you wonder, ""Really? There was no other way to get to the two fools now, was there?"" Oh sorry, how would the writers be able to write all the skin-show and other rubbish in? And well, it is only me who can complain about missing logic and question supposedly existing logic in a David Dhawan film. Like any other David Dhawan film, Rascals made me laugh once or twice. It also immediately took the fun away by characters explaining the joke just cracked or stretching it for an extra 5-10 seconds. And that can be said about the film too. You think it's over and there comes more and then some more and then finally the closing credit song. And you know the scary bit? There seems to be a hint at a sequel. ]"
528,"[Soundtrack starts out with us following pretentious-looking Raunak (Rajeev Khandelwal). Raunak is seen tapping his feet and stopping to lend an ear to the rhythms of life. Having seen and liked Rajeev Khandelwal's earlier work I assumed that Raunak must actually be shallow and fake in terms of his understanding of music. But turns out that he actually has a good ear for music. Which means Rajeev Khandelwal isn't doing a good job. The sinking feeling gets worse with the OD of drugs, alcohol and sex. And then the story begins and boy did it suck me in - both because of the performances and the narration. Soundtrack is a good example of a simple, predictable story told with a heart and devotion. You start out either hating or being unmoved by a character and in the next hour you find yourself caring for him. You want him to do well, however predictable that makes the film. This is achieved with mediocre production values. There is no fancy camerawork; neither are gimmicks used to depict the neurosis Raunak is going through. The only thing above average is the sound design. That too, there isn't anything marvelous about it. And even though these tools aren't used, the narrative engages the audience. Rajeev Khandelwal doesn't disappoint one bit. In hindsight, even his act in the first 10-15 minutes can be overlooked as Raunak is a rather cocksure and selfish character. I totally loved Soha Ali Khan, her real act starts way into the second half and yet when you come out, her character has left an impression and a couple of scenes to remind you of her. Soundtrack runs along the themes of life, its uncertainties and how people deal with or completely fail to deal with what is dealt to them. But, it also indirectly touches upon mental illnesses. While the solution Soundtrack comes up with might not be medically sound, probable or correct; the importance of strong will depicted in overcoming those odds is a slim ray of hope for people when they go through dark times. And the most important reason why Soundtrack works for me is that it is based on a true-life story. The impact of those two words, ""true life"" is enough to give Soundtrack a shot. And I'd recommend a theater watch, just because the impact could be lost/reduced if it is watched with interruptions/distractions. ]"
529,"[It's what we're best at, as an audience - giving out two cents worth on how to handle a situation in a film, and laughing with/at the person involved in the pickle. It's the kind of film that makes you curse the protagonist and feel extreme reactions that stays with you for longer. Apres Vous or After You, Pierre Salvadori's latest film, does that to you - as you witness Antoine (Daniel Auteui) going out of his way to help Louis (Jose Garcia) from committing suicide. A limp, emotionally disturbed Loius stands on a suitcase in a park, with a rope around his neck, about to end his life. Antoine takes a shortcut through the same park, only to find him and save him. He soon becomes his caretaker, slowly trying to solve everything that is wrong in Louis's life.Daniel Auteui is absolutely charming, as a funny savior for Louis, while he drives Louis around and saves him from all sorts of trouble. So why would he go through all this trouble? His girlfriend Christine (Marilyne Canto) asks him the same thing, and on not getting an answer, they things go awfully wrong. It's this underway irony in the film that makes for a hilarious 2 hours. You keep trying to figure out why Antoine would wreck his personal life to mend someone else's.The film takes an edgy turn once Antoine meets the girl who's responsible for Louis suicidal nature. Blanche (Sandrine Kiberlain) is a typical French beauty. Glowing blonde, long-legged and freckled - she creates further havoc for Antoine. And suddenly, everything that has been established in the film so far - relationships, his motivation/nature to help a broken soul goes for a toss. It's almost lunatic, this film, where every situation Antoine finds himself in, beats the previous one. The best part of Apres Vous, is that it doesn't offer you any answers. There's a scene in the film when Antoine brings Louis home for the first time. He lies to his girlfriend about Louis. The look on Antoine's face when he reveals to Christine that he doesn't even know the guy's name aptly describes the film: Crazy, illogical and just charmingly funny!The DVD has no extra features, apart from other Paramount Classics film trailers. The subtitles are up to mark, at no point do you feel you're missing the point of the dialogue.Apres Vous has a clumsy, endearing feel to it. You want to put yourself in Antoine's shoes and knock some sense into him. You want to be a shrewder person, who thinks about the self first. Writers Daniele Dubroux, Benoit Graffin, David Leotard and Pierre Salvadori could have made the script a bit tighter, and maybe developed a stronger relationship between Antoine and Louis. Otherwise, Apres Vous is a breezy, light film that just makes you want to relive all the comic misunderstandings. It's not the best film you'll see but your heart will go out to it nonetheless.]"
530,"[I'm a little under the weather. The annoying type of being unwell where you don't have fever but are feverish. While walking into Hum Tum Shabana I thought all ache-able parts of my body are already aching. Nope. Hum Tum Shabana made me realize that my ears weren't aching at the beginning.Hum (Shreyas Talpade/Tusshar Kapoor), Tum (Tusshar Kapoor/Shreyas Talpade) and Shabana (Minissha Lamba) are all loud and are surrounded by louder people. The story goes from weird (two guys falling in love at the same time with the same woman the first time they see her on screen) to berserk (wooing her in the most ridiculous fashion) to utter rubbish (they want to get out of proposing to her because of reasons you should find out for yourself, if you are interested despite this warning). Sometime in the berserk era, there is one scene that is so ridiculous that it's funny. ""How could you even come up with that?"" kind of funny. But save that there's nothing at all in the film. Well, I guess I got that  one laugh I was looking for. These are times I wish I could borrow, NW1W (not worth one word) concept from milliblog. Till then, here's my attempt at keeping it short and simple - Skip!]"
531,"[Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster creates a mystic aura around itself. It has the ambience of the heartland where princes still reign their now unofficial kingdoms with pride. With this background, though the story is of the same ol' politics and deceit. Like any good thriller, Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster manages to make you consider the motivations of each character in turn, however small their role in the scheme of things. That is what keeps you engaged. Though it would have gotten us involved a lot more if we were involved with the characters of the film. These characters - be it the king (Saheb), the queen (Biwi), the servant who happens to be a gangster, or the other people around these three main characters - have strong reactions and we are given a glimpse of the justification for their reactions, but not once can we feel why the reaction was so strong. For example, each of the three main characters are shown to be madly in love and that seems to be the motivation behind their strong actions and reactions. But, the only way you know they are in love is because they are having sex with the person they are supposedly in love with. Other than that, there is no clue left of their love. The emotional connect needed to get the gravity of the behavior is missing. And yet, based on just the thriller element of the film, the curiosity of what will happen next exists. That curiosity does wane with the progress of the film because of way-too-many double-crossing and double-double-crossing characters. But still, its not a half bad thriller. A lot of the credit goes to the witty dialogue and its delivery. There is something inherently aristocratic about Jimmy Sheirgill and that works towards making his character the required amount of arrogant and vulnerable that princes in today's times are. Randeep Hooda and Mahie Gill are just about functional. Given the film revolves around their sensuality, I wonder if the film would have worked better if there were actors with more oomph value, especially Mahie Gill.Also, given how much of the film revolves around attraction, seduction and sensuousness, those scenes are shot with the standard Indian awkwardness making you wonder why the characters are attempting to make love when they are so uncomfortable with the very idea. With all that's wrong with Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster, it is still a half-interesting watch. Only makes you wonder, what a wonderful film it would have been had it got even a little more right. ]"
532,"[Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive begins with a cursive pink-font opening-credits, and the kind of background music you would hear in a car - semi-thumping, lounge-ish beats with a 80s retro-electronica pinch (take a bow Cliff Martinez). We are then introduced to the film's unnamed protagonist, the Driver (Ryan Gosling). With a half toothpick, a scorpion jacket and brooding eyes, he moves through the entire film with an unnerving calmness. I can't say the same about my journey of the film though - Drive manages to break the hypnotic spell, the moment you just about get into the grovoe of its controlled, thought-provoking cinematography and trance like, anticipated soundtrack.Drive is a neo-noir, smooth and sporadic film about an edgy hero (and I use this word deliberately) and his escapades. Refn uses the archetypal split-lighting to establish the driver's character, followed by the hovering cloud of a western film (in which the protagonist's an unadulterated badass).By day, he works as a car stuntman and part time, in a garage.  By night, however, he drives. No really, in his words, ""If I drive for you, you give me a time and a place...I drive. "" Abandoning all morals (quite unlike his job and his overpowering image), he stands as an amused observer of the corrupt world he's a part of. There, the Driver gives you a slight aftertaste of films like Taxi Driver. The film uses a popular, pulp fiction-esque narrative. Of course, the treatment is stylistic, a nasty bit of a tease. It's a hide and seek of what-now and wow-really? You see similar signs - the pink font, an opening sequence which establishes the feat of our protagonist, the jarring car chases, and the bad guys who are almost like contemporary Mafia lookalikes. Yet the film doesn't take a moment to jump from a subtle cat-and-mouse chase to a full blown blood war. There are skull-breaking, knife diving moments in the scene almost as if Refn wanted to celebrate the idea of violence by making us believe it was never going to cross our paths. Driver's bond with his neigbour Irene (the sensual Carey Mulligan) is silent, and furthered by his relationship with her kid, while her husband, Standard (Oscar Issac) is in prison. The film takes a bloody turn, when the Driver helps Standard in a heist to clear his debts and issues. Here starts the predicament (read: almost sadistic war of the blood splatters.)However, at some point during Drive, the stylistic treatment of the fights between good and evil takes over the plot of the film. You realize soon into the second half that the story has been abandoned to take upon the intended feel of the film - one that we had only been given glimpses of through the first half, mostly through the Drivers lilted, calm voice and brooding eyes.You also question the driver's motive for all this violence, because somewhere amidst the rhythmic visuals and the colossal build up, Refn fails to establish a concrete relationship between the Driver and Irene. You don't understand how someone like the Driver, who otherwise seems like he doesn't give two bricks about anything, would undergo all this mess for a woman he barely spoke 8 words with. Once you accept to move past these questions, Drive is a hard-hitting, dark and downright entertaining film. Might not work for the faint-hearted, but the good thing of Drive is that it gives you enough to think-ponder-mesmerize before the violence starts. ]"
533,"[Who would have thought that in a film starring Vinay Pathak, I'd be complaining about limited talent? But, that happens when you are fooled into believing that it is a Vinay Pathak film. Tere Mere Phere is almost 75% about Rahul (Jagrat Desai) and Pooja (Sasha Goradia) than it is about Jai played by Vinay Pathak. And boy, do Rahul and Pooja annoy! It's cute to see arguments that you have at home, on the big screen. You sort-of, kind-of can identify with the characters. But the issue here is Rahul and Pooja are bickering as a newly-wed couple. And most of their rows reminded me of the kind of tiffs I had with my brother, when I was 10 and he was 5! - That is the kind of amateur writing we are talking about. It's a little unsettling then, when you see sudden insight in the dialogue spouted by an unlikely character or even a subtle suggestion in terms of what a character does. For example, the thing that a newly-wed wife wouldn't want her husband to be exposed to her natural processes, things that make her too human. Or like the mom of a newly-wed son wants to be a part of his life. But then there are things like a character is so childlike two scenes ago, suddenly gains wisdom. So, you have a character who aims at having perfect relationships, be it with her husband or her mother-in-law, but at the same time breaks glassware when angry.I understand lovers' spats are like that, you fight and you make-up, you quarrel and you try to understand. But here, there seemed to be no pattern other than convenience for the writer. I mean, how can a HUGE fight about a reasonably huge error on the part of a spouse, be forgiven within minutes? Like the said insights, there is a dash of humor that shows up as a surprise. Surprise because the laughs come after the interval and even after they start, the quips are too far apart. I liked the relief in the form of Rahul's family played by Darshan Jariwala, the actor who plays his younger son (?) and even Sushmita Mukherjee, but wouldn't watch an entire film of a couple squabbling for that.Other than that though, it's mostly screeching and shouting. I was astounded that a woman director would portray ALL three of her women characters as high-pitched, bossy-pushy women. And it's not like she was not involved in the writing, Deepa Sahi is a co-writer. And yet, it would be unfair to judge Deepa Sahi's directorial capabilities based on just Tere Mere Phere. A huge part of why the film comes across as a shoddy product is because of the budget constraints. I'm assuming, that had there been a better budget, there would have been better actors. And with different actors, this is one film which could have been very different. And of course, at least 20-25 minutes edited out. I push a lot of the blame on the actors because you can understand that the ""look"" of a film suffers at the hands of a low budget. But, some things are quite in control of an actor. For example, Sasha Goradia's  dubbing was that like of a English film dubbed in Hindi. Very distracting, very irritating. Especially when she laughs or screeches - which is a lot. And yet, the film is not a complete loss. That's because of the relatable subject, a little humor, a little hope of watching Vinay Pathak. Basically, something to stop by for a bit while skipping channels.]"
534,"[If you made a list of things that an ideal action-romance film should have. Force would have checkmarks in all the boxes. Good vs. EvilStrong action-packed sequencesBreathers from the action - emotional /comic scene, or in our Hindi parlance a songA believable romanceFunctional sidekicksA dreaded villainSo on and so forth.When you consider the overall package, it isn't a film that you HAVE to rush to the theater to. It's a good-looking film which balances the tightrope of narrating a story with simplicity and fulfills its ""commercial"" obligations. But, it misses out on having that something extra - call it a zing, call it a soul. As I write these words, to my own eye I come across as a slave-driver who expects the world out of her movies. But, there is something out of place, when I am making a checklist and thinking aloud, ""everything is there, then why did it feel so choppy, so functional?"" The generic treatment given to Force is rather clinical. But, there are scenes that work. Some action sequences are grueling enough to make you want them to stop. The romance has a couple of genuine moments, as in you can see why these two are falling in love with each other, the gap that they fill in each other's' lives is clear. The villain is intelligent and not some caricatured, over-stylized ""creature"". In fact, he is a handsome villain. I don't remember the last time a villain could have passed off as the hero. Which also means the casting is perfect. And that's not limited to Vidyut Jamwal who plays Vishnu - note the irony - the destroyer of all things good, the villain. John Abraham couldn't have been cast better. He has to play an honest Asst. Commissioner of Police who has no family or friend ties because he wants to focus on his work. So single-minded is he in his work that, he is called sookha jhaad - a dead tree. And if there's anyone in the industry who can play a dead tree, John Abraham is the man! And no, there is no sarcasm here. I say this with utmost sincerity that this was perfect casting. His muscles make him drool-worthy and the grit on his face makes him a great, rigid police officer. Genelia D'Souza passes off as a breath of fresh air that she needs to be in such a sullen environment. But, nothing anyone else couldn't have carried off neither something we haven't seen her do earlier. That Force is a perfect, typical masala film is both its strength and its weakness. You enjoy it while it lasts, but it doesn't linger on any of your senses. When good people die, you feel bad, but your heart doesn't reach out to them. When evil people die, you are relieved, but you are not that angry at him that you want to see his meat minced. You are engaged in the 2+ hours but you are not involved. who is dreaded because he is a thinkerAnyway, having talked about the clinical treatment to the film, I want to focus on how enjoyable the particular sequences of the film are. ]"
535,"[Indians living abroad. Oh, what a rotten life they have! They have to make an identity for themselves, especially in a sport. So, what do they do? They make a team that has only Indians, naaah...these particular people are Punjabis, so they make a team of only Punjabis to fight the goras (Whites). Such is the convoluted interpretation of liberalism and/or nationalism. Fine, I wasn't supposed to expect anything else from a film that calls itself Speedy Singhs. But, shouldn't there be at least a ghost of a story. Some conflict that will make me wonder what's to happen next. Let alone that, the conflict itself is predictable. So, then, we have stand-up comedian Russell Peters and chocolate boy Vinay Virmani to look forward to. Or not. Though, it is imperative to mention that I saw a dubbed version of the film, which means all the actors were speaking out translations of English dialogues in Hindi in the utmost ridiculous fashion, you know like Night at a Museum in Hindi. Yes, Rob Lowe too! Oh, how I felt for one of my favorite West Wing actors. The bhangra, the toilet jokes, and given there's Russell Peters, there are the racial, political incorrect humor too. None of it entertains or makes me laugh. It just felt like one of the films that make you go numb even if they are short. ]"
536,"[Mausam is like a pleasant evening breeze - you enjoy it for a bit and then fall asleep. Which is extremely sad, because you see the labour of love in each frame. It's pretty in every corner. But, the love story unfortunately goes on and on like a battery in its advert. Fine, I didn't fall asleep but that's because I don't believe in sleeping in films, especially the ones I'm reviewing. But, I could completely imagine someone dozing off for a bit, and guess what they wouldn't have missed much when they woke up. Ironically, the eased-out pace Mausam starts with, is the only bit that's charming about the story. It's so pretty, so serene, so simple that high expectations are set for the drama to unfold. I enjoyed the leisurely life of a village with its cute sense of humor. But maybe, like life in the village, the story doesn't move. The characters move on, their problems and state of mind remain the same. Which is fine, that's what happens when we are in love. But, I'd enjoy my love story, I lose connection with the love between Harry (Shahid Kapoor) and Aayat (Sonam Kapoor). And there are enough, ""aawwww, so sweet"" moments in the first half hour. I also admired how the ""sarson de khet"" (mustard farms) I've been fed for over 15 years, felt fresh in the way they have been captured. The straight lines that railway tracks and electrical poles formed; the curves that bumpy paths and underground water pipes lying around the said ""sarso de khet"" formed - all very painstakingly framed. In fact, except for a tacky video-game-ish air-attack sequence, Mausam is beautifully shot. But, the sweetness of a relationship and the cinematography of a film can take it only so far. Of course, there is value to getting exasperated along with the characters' frustrations. But, not if it translates to irritation with the film itself. Not if, in a love story, you are forced to say, ""true love and all is ok, make them meet and get done with it already!"" And it's not like the writers haven't put in distractions along the way. There are enough of them. And I'm not talking about just the energetic songs which make you feel like you can watch Shahid Kapoor dance forever. There is historical and political context within which our lead pair struggles. Politics that you and I have witnessed. Times that we have horrific memories of. We should've gotten involved, we should've rooted for the lead pair. We don't. This is despite the fact that you see at least one of the two beautiful people in each frame of the screen. I didn't quite get why Harry went so rigid. I was almost going to blame Shahid Kapoor for not being able to carry off the ""serious"" facet of Harry, but soon realized that Harry had lost all his charm and vigor. Sonam Kapoor on the other hand maintains a status quo throughout the film. In fact, her expressions are a carry forward from her debut film, Saawariya.A love story between a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl minus the parents who usually raise hell. The lovers' bad luck keeps getting worse and the hatred around them won't let them be together. Hatred that isn't even directly linked to their lives. The tragedy is rather poetic, in that, the two who want to live in a time and space oblivion are separated by geography and a timeline. But poetry can be boring. ]"
537,"[A few weeks ago, when we caught the trailer of Abduction on IMDB, a friend happened to bring something very relevant to my notice. In essence, Abduction looked like it was a more stylized, self-serious version of the forgettable Salman Khan Starrer Tumko Na Bhool Payenge (TNBP). I wanted to disagree  because secretly I found Taylor Lautner very umm...good looking. But I couldn't - and this further reinforced after I watched the film.Abduction is centered on a teenager, Nathan Harper (Lautner) who figures that he's been lied to about his identity when he finds his baby picture on a missing person's website. Further investigation into this takes him on an unexpected journey of (predictable) revelations and a web of complicated truths about his identity. He has recurring dreams about his hidden identity (Reason for comparing to TNBP no 1), for which he seeks psychiatric help. Unfortunately that doesn't stop him from being sunk into the messy whirlpool. Of course, it all sorts itself out once Lautner decided to bare his shirt (reason no. 2) and take matters in his own hands. Alongside his high school crush, Karen Lowell (Lily Collins), he embarks upon a brave (allows the heroism) little expedition that makes for a repetitive, bordering on hilarious visual experience. The film faults fundamentally with its inability to evoke empathy for the lead teenager who is in such a mess. Even if we manage to move above and beyond a relationship (or lack thereof) with the protagonist, what jars the most about Abduction is the fact that everybody in the film, most of all Director, John Singleton takes themselves much too seriously, and for no real reason, I deduced. Singleton's 2 Fast 2 Furious was at least true to its genre - of being a fast paced, testosterone pumping, macho film.  Writer Shawn Christensen has written a script of convenience. Clues just happen to fall upon Nathan's lap, he just happens to have exactly what he needs at any given moment of time - there's no intellectual struggle on his part. The only struggle we see is with Lautner and his acting abilities. And we know he's hot- but it can't all be a breeze for him, can it?The film looks its part though - with a monotone palate and of course, it helps to have a good looking protagonist, but on every other account, Abduction fails. You know a film is bad, if I recommend you watch the Twilight series instead. ]"
538,"[They say the right cast can make a film, in least, a charming affair. So when you hear of a film starring Hugh Grant (childhood poster boy for me) and Sarah Jessica Parker (soul sister from the Sex and the City series) you think the film would be a perfect late night breeze watch. Well, let's just say, you should use the money you would spend on the DVD to re-rent Sex and the City or Notting Hill, and stick to those.Did You Hear About the Morgans? is about a separated couple Paul Morgan (Hugh Grant) and Meryl Morgan (Sarah Jessica Parker) and their struggle with their relationship. For the first half hour, you see  Grant, who's a big-shot lawyer, trying to win back  Parker with his goofy, boyish charms.  Parker however, can only play Carrie Bradshaw (lead character from Sex and the City) in every performance. As a successful real estate agent, she plays her usual confused, blingy New Yorker.All hell breaks loose, when as a part of witness protection, they are sent to a faraway town in Wyoming for a week, to lay low. The film then progresses to show a city-town conflict, and how the couple strives to get along and make their marriage work.Granted, Hugh Grant's witty, puppy-faced humour works in part but on the whole, the film stands as a lazy attempt to make a romantic comedy. Did You Hear About the Morgans? is neither funny nor romantic. It's not even a film I would want to unwind with at the end of a long day when I don't want to indulge in intelligent, symbolic cinema. Beyond a point, there's only so much of Carrie Bradshaw you can pair with extremely British Hugh Grant. He's largely very wooden and conscious, while she just reminds us how disastrous people can look while they age. The jokes are second hand, the plot is repetitive and predictable and everyone in film seems to want so desperately to make it a funny affair, it just starts to get annoying.A small note about the hunter couple, Clay and Emma Wheeler (Sam Elliot and Mary Streenburgen) - to say they're the saving grace of the film is an understatement. They serve as a pleasant contrast to the bratty, city-bred characters that Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parkerplay. One of my (read: the rare few) favorite moments in the film, is when the Wheelers ask Meryl Morgan what meat she likes and she says she's a vegetarian who supports PETA. Mary's reply is one of the best!The DVD of Did You Hear About the Morgans? Has 3 featurettes, including one with director Marc Lawrence on why he chose the lead pair. Also the director of previously successful films like Miss Congeniality and Music and Lyrics, his insights on casting seem convincing, and you wonder where it all went wrong with this film. Other features include, deleted scenes (funnier than the film, because Hugh Grant is funny otherwise!), extended theatrical trailers and an audio commentary with Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker.The only way you should watch this film? 1. If you got this DVD for free, (I would ask you to reconsider) 2. If you're bored, 3. If you're really, really bored. Besides, I think its imperative you ask yourself this question, Do You Really Want to Hear about the Morgans?]"
539,"[When a movie, with a genre you don't particularly care about, gets you passionately involved in a discussion about the outcome and characters - you know it's a movie worth its money. Warrior does that to you, engaging you in a fighter film about two estranged brothers, ex-Army officer Tommy (Tom Hardy) and School teacher Brendon (Joel Edgerton). Both enter an MMA (mixed martial arts) tournament with a 5 million cash prize for different reasons. It's a battle within a war - and it transcends to an emotional flight of two brothers. Tommy's battling with his own demons, and the tournament for him becomes an escape. Brendon, on the other hand needs the money to prevent his home from being held by the bank.  The family's a broken one - ex-Alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) who lives alone and two brothers who have gone their separate ways. Through the film, you can sense the complexity of each relationship. The brothers broke apart when the parents got divorced - and imaginary boundaries were formed. The father's drinking past has led him to isolation from the sons. Yet Tommy returns to be trained by his father for the tournament - and somewhere then, you know there is scope (and are hoping) for reconciliation.Does it incorporate cliches? Yes, you can expect drama and a few tears, alongside some heavy-duty MMA action. It's the kind of sport I routinely stay away from when on TV - mostly because I never understood how someone could make a sport out of beating each other up so brutally. However with Warrior you learn to move past the fundamentals. You feel the blood and bones of the fights and you know the outcome, but that's acceptable because it takes you with it on the journey. The treatment is a tad bit cliched - because you know who's going to win the fights, you know how, and while the tension is being built up between the father and the brothers, you know where you're headed. The film works mainly because of the superb performances; clear winner remains Nick Nolte. A vulnerable yet tough ex-alcoholic and fighter, he deals with the strange turn of events in a realistically painful way. Tom Hardy is in his element, as an aggressive, emotionally burdened character - results of which show in his fighting. Joel Edgerton is heart-warming; you can feel his pain.By the climax of the film, you start to feel that the weight of the script lapses, but director Gavin O'Connor manages to divert your attention to the intense fights. The overpowering feeling of redemption hovers around the movie, and before you know, you get powerfully involved with Warrior. I'm quoting a friend here, who shared my exact sentiments of the film, ""I think there's still some scope for Hollywood"".]"
540,"[Oh how I lashed out at reviews that conveniently resorted to cliched lines like, ""feel good film"". I never understood it, and always thought there were better ways to describe a film. But like they say, Karma is a b****. A while ago, I randomly picked up British director Mike Leigh's film, Happy Go Lucky on the recommendation of a friend. With Sally Hawkins in the lead (of Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream fame), it seemed like a promising film about a jarringly positive and optimistic protagonist, Poppy. Lo and behold, my first thought was, ""Wow, what a feel good film!"" Sigh, such is life. Happy Go Lucky struck me because the film is just that - it's not plot heavy at all. It's just a film about a woman in her early thirties who lives an independent single life in London and is positive about most things. Simple? Double yes and very much endearing.It's a harder role to play than say, Desdemona from Othello. She must be happy, cheerful, positive at all times in the film, as if the sun rose from within her body. She sifts through her job as an elementary teacher and not surprisingly she's a delight with children. She shares a very comfortable relationship with her cynical roommate Zoe, and we are forced to see her life through the extremely cheerful glasses she thrusts in front of our eyes. The relevance of her character however comes through most once she starts taking driving lessons from Scott (Eddie Marson), a bitter, antisocial, conspiracy-spitting, absolute contrast to Poppy. It's in their encounters that you truly enjoy the film, in its stripped down form. When you hear their conversations - him ranting about how everything is wrong with the world and her asking him to relax and live a little - you understand the dynamics of human identity. The credit of this mostly goes to Mike Leigh, for being able to show you different viewpoints in such a colorful way. The DVD of Happy Go Lucky includes a commentary from Mike Leigh, an 18-minute making-of featurette of the driving lesson scenes with Scott and Poppy. It's a hilarious watch for the jokes and behind the scene commentary that Sally Hawkins provides -  makes you see a witty side of her in reality. It also includes a 27-minute interview with Mike Leigh where he talks about the characters, and who he envisioned to play to role of Poppy. While the film progresses you see Poppy go through some difficult relationships, and situations. And she does get reduced to silence and contemplation every now and then, but the idea of the film is to be able to let us ponder over our little complaints about insignificant issues. Alternatively, we have Poppy, who wears a grin in every scene and never loses hope. I know it's easier portrayed on film than done, but to make a feel-good (gah!) film that can make you believe that you should adopt a refreshed perspective on life is not easy. It's not a simple road; this optimism. Infact, it's rather brave to make a film about it, at the risk of being criticized for being ignorant, unreal and the works. Speaks volumes about Mike Leigh's own insight into human perspectives and how they are manifested. Inspite of the depressing moments of the film (it has a few), it emerges almost as a guide book. The kind that is trying to tell you, ""Have you ever really lost anything by being an optimist?""]"
541,"[It's kind of tiring when ALL the characters in a film have a U-turnaround. Of course, there's barely anything you cannot predict about a rom-com. But there is something about the chemistry, the ""lines"", the situations that you look forward to. Crazy Stupid Love has a little bit of this and an o-kay bit of that, but none of it is satisfying enough to make me recommend the film to you, even if it's playing on TV. You have your regular cool, suave Jacob (Ryan Gosling) who knows how to objectify women and get them anyway. He obviously, guides simple, clueless-around-women-because-he-respects-them Cal (Steve Carell) through finding his ""manhood"". That stage set, the women flit in and out of the screen as per convenience. But, the actors who play these women, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and even Analeigh Tipton are so strong that they make their presence felt, however short their screen time may be. In comparison, the two men Ryan Josling and Steve Carelljust look like they are going through the drill of looking HOT and confused respectively. What broke my heart was Marisa Tomei's performance. Where is the lady who blows my mind away every time I watch My Cousin Vinny? In Crazy Stupid Love, she is over-acting and rather melodramatic. :( In fact, a lot of things in the film are melodramatic - from the slo-mo for Jacob, to a repeat-for-effect for Steve Carell; from people in audience/on street clapping for the protagonists for no good reason, to the climax. All effectively cringe-worthy. In the middle of this though are some of the funny scenes from the trailer and some cozy, romantic moments. Are they enough to pull you through though? Would have/could have, had there been a better climax. The one twist in the film is pretty cool, but it all falls flat with the ""whatevaa"" feeling the film gives when it ends. And that did it for me, till then I was doing alright with all the side-stories the film is laced with, they were all interesting. But, they led nowhere. And they have some shock-value situations and dialogues thrown in. They make you smile, but their purpose to catch you off-guard is transparent. You soon realize, they weren't necessary for core plot to move forward.I'm being realistic here. Yes, I see the irony. Realistic for a rom-com! Anyway, I'm being realistic in that I didn't expect to be swept off the floor. But, I thought I'd have fun. For most parts, I didn't. ]"
542,"[Rom-coms like Mere Brother Ki Dulhan make you wonder what ""love"" really is. It doesn't really give you any deep understanding of the concept in general or even in terms of the characters. In fact, the way characters fall in and out of love in Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, it is clear that the film doesn't want us to take it or any of its characters seriously. The basic idea is to have fun, other things, like logic, etc can wait for another film. And so you go with the writer's definition of what love is - spending some good fun time together. Thankfully, the ""fun"" part is enjoyable. And it is only because of Katrina Kaif. It's like she just cut herself loose. You can sense all the stiff body language, awkwardness and self-consciousness in her films so far, when you see how freely she's breathing here. This freedom also is helped by the fact that there are no serious moments in the film, even when her character is in pretty much deep sh!t. So, that saves her from having to emote anything other than a cheerful face. Within that though, she aces her comic timing. The rest of the cast, including Imran Khan, look like mere pawns that are necessary to create context for her to be jubilant. Even so, while Imran Khan goes about the motions of being awed by the stunning Katrina Kaif, Ali Zafar progressively kills bits of interest you can have in his character, with every time that he opens his mouth. The accent, the mannerisms, the body language are all annoyingly over-the-top. Also, the story is structured such that it revolves around Katrina Kaif's character Dimple. Her free spirit attracts everyone around her to her. Sure, the dialogue is witty and there are enough laughs in there for one and all, but anyone who has seen the trailer, or even heard the title of the film, knows how the film is going to end. And that is exactly why, we won't get involved in the story. We don't invest too much attention on the story because we know by hook or crook, the inevitable is going to happen. I won't say the writers haven't tried to make the ""how they get there"" part interesting. They try and even succeed a bit in the earlier parts of the film. But as the film progresses, the situation gets more and more ridiculous. And you begin to feel the climax is being postponed unnecessarily. Other fillers like songs break in abruptly, but the music and especially the lyrics are entertaining. Also, the picturization - that is the dances and colors used for costumes/art work make the screen look vibrant and full of energy. I didn't think a day would come when I'd say that the only thing going for a film is Katrina Kaif. Take her out and the film collapses because the material is weak. Mere Brother Ki Dulhan starts with asking me to believe that an outgoing, flirtatious guy is convincing his brother to look for a wife for him and has in it everything from social pressure by families to gullible parents who are being played around by their children. They try to use wit in weird situations the characters get themselves into; they succeed partially, but it is difficult to overlook the overall disregard to sense or rather overt respect for nonsense.]"
543,"[Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis both followed their performances in the challenging Black Swan with similarly themed rom-coms. Does Arrenofsky have an answer for that one? Or it is just the joy of being a part of light film? While No Strings Attached (released earlier in the year with Ashton Kutcher and Portman) was a poorly written film, Friends With Benefit is sharper and better performed. But is it different on any other account?Friends With Benefit is an intelligent film. We are forced to ignore that the film falls prey to the same age-old stereotypes that it mocks all throughout the first half of the film - because the lead pair is just so .. pretty. The film revolves around two emotionally damaged/unavailable people - Jamie (Mila Kunis) who's a placement agent and Dylan (Justin Timberlake) who becomes the art editor at GQ magazine through Jamie. They agree that they don't want relationships and realize that they'd be better off as friends who indulge in casual sex. Well, that's a revelation. Because we really haven't heard that one before. We are then taken through a good 45 mins of the yummy two in their bare essentials, getting frisky all over the place. Reason no 1 to like the film. The first half is funny, smart and a total win because it makes you want to rethink when you were in such a situation and how that went horribly wrong (ouch). You wonder - if they're having so much fun it must actually be a plausible alternate to the big L. They flip through corny rom-coms on TV and make fun of it, they mock their exes and most importantly they don't cuddle, romance or get mushy. Reason no 2. What we ignore to see (or are made to) is that Jamie is actually a die-hard romantic. She claims to genuinely believe in true love and a prince charming because of a troubled childhood. So while they go through their steamy sessions of casual-ness, and while a small part of you wants to freeze the near-perfect scenario, you know what's in store during the next half of the film. Conflict arises, but of course. It might not be the regular conflict, but its conflict enough to make the lead pair question their friendships. Yada yada, fights, tears, heavy background music later Friends With Benefit is the same film that Timberlake and Kunis make fun of in the first half. Cliches abound. The real conflict is in your head. Do you like the film or do you not? It's a good looking film, Friends With Benefit. Set in New York, it makes you want to move and live ""the good life"". The background score has a pop music bounce to it - which in Timberlake's words, ""makes you believe you had a good time watching the film"". The pace of the film is crisp, so it doesn't allow you to analyze whilst drooling over the lead pair. It's only after you leave that you realize the shortcomings of the film. Director Will Gluck admits to making a film that wouldn't stand at PG 13, because ""they (the lead pair) realize that they're in a romantic comedy story -- as two regular people who aren't in a movie would comment on"" and act accordingly. Hence the ""reality"" - casual sex, denial and conflict. But what about the cliched, mushy end? Oh that's just the Hollywood studio's requirement, I hear. ]"
544,"[Robert Rodriguez - really? Where has the Rodriguez of Sin City and Planet Terror disappeared? After watching the fourth installment of the Spy Kids series, I happened to pass by a McDonalds - where I was bombarded with more merchandise from Spy Kids. It makes me wonder - is this the same director? Spy Kids - All The Time In The World or Spy Kid 4D is the fourth movie from the Spy Kids series, dealing with a Spy Kids department that has now become world famous in solving crimes. It is sparked off from the first movie where kids Carmen and Juni (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara) help their parents (who are spy agents) with an espionage mission. Spy Kid 4D tells us about the aftermath of the success of the OSS (world's top spy agency). Jessica Alba joins the film with her two step children Rebecca and Cecil (Rowan Blanchard and Mason Cook) to fight against a sinister Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven) who attempts to take over the world.To be fair, the first movie, plain and simple Spy Kids, was a fresh film filled with mazes, codes, pranks and anagrams. It gave many children that fantastical space, which was unexplored before the Harry Potter series. But as we've seen with many films (especially with children's films in Hollywood) - by the 4th installment you have a star to make the film's worth triple fold (Alba) - high technological placing (4D, and we'll take about that later) and no story. It's pretty much like a moving, technology spewing version of the very toy I see at fast food joints. Alba takes her kids along with her on the mission, and so Rodriguez manages to throw in a few laughs here and there - all of it banks on the scatological humour, which does work with most kids. But other than that it seems like he's written the movie in his sleep. The overall effect of the film - with its watered down visual effects, bad chroma backgrounds and horrid acting on almost everyone's part is not worth your time, to put it mildly. You almost wonder if the film was made for lesser than Rodriguez's $7000 debut El Mariachi.The Indian release however has not seen a 4D effect at all. The film promises a 4D Aromascope effect which allows you smell and feel the film as well. Except, I was given regular 3D glasses and nothing more. And I'm not even surprised. I'm told not many multiplexes in the country have actually followed the 4D scheme. The film does have a Rodriguez watermark on it though - we see a few witty moments and the entire series is Hispanic dominated, one thing that remains a constant. Kids will find the robot dog (voiced by Ricky Gervais) pretty amusing, as he's stupid and funny with the humour. For those who have been following the series, Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino (parents from the previous films) will be missed - but much respect to them for staying out of this one.I was all set to write a super nasty piece on how Hollywood is considering kid's entertainment the biggest commercial venture of the decade; and then I realized something. If Robert Rodriguez gets the leverage to indulge in independent films like From Dusk Till Dawn series, Machete and other classics like The Faculty and Desparado - because he makes commercials sewers like these, I think we can allow him this mistake. ]"
545,"[Most women I know have admitted to hating or being scared at the thought of having children. It's surprising actually; they're all killing the cliche about women loving babies. Even so, you'll usually see people fawning over infants, children below the age of 7 or 8. Let's face it, when was the last time you heard someone say, ""OMG, I met the most adorable 11 year old!""? In Howard Zeif's My Girl, however, you end up feeling a surging love for the two lead 11-year olds, Vada (Anna Clumsky) and Thomas J (Macaulay Culkin, yes the Home Alone kid). My Girl is a story about two kids and their innocent, starry-eyed lives as they move through life's offerings.Vada is a hypochondriac attention seeker - typical pre-teen, who feels like the world's coming to an end because her father, who owns a funeral parlour, has found new-found love in his make-up artist (Jamie Lee Curtis). She confides her crazy theories, intellectual rants and thoughts in Thomas J, her only friend. The setting is very ""The Wonder Years"" like; both kids face the regular troubles of a pre-teenage; You can sense a deep, deep friendship between the two - one they might not even be aware of. He claims Vada is his girl (via a more mature voiceover that gages the film) - and that's how you can see exactly why the movie is called so.Vada's father (Dan Ackroyd) is a typical sitcom father -one who instills enough into Vada but is ignorant of her needs and questions. It's her relationship with her father, and her fears that leads to her personality - one of questions, admirations, astonishments and an endearing naivete. Jamie Lee Curtis as Shelly is smart and appealing - it's through her that we realize Vada's issues with her father and relationships in general.The beauty of My Girl is the ability to see the two characters in a pure coming-of-age story. You often want to just make them sit in front of you with cookies and milk, and you want to talk to them. Tell them how lucky they are to be that young, and innocent, free from opinions and pressures. When the film gets over, you've lived an entire circle with the characters, and you'll be left wishing there was more.Vada's relationship with the other characters in the film is remarkably told. She and her father share a very on-off, negligible relationship, and it's a refreshing change to see a father-daughter relationship that isn't either abusive or saccharine sweet. Vada's teacher Mr Bixler (Griffin Dunne) is sensitive and very profound in his ability to invoke the wondrous thoughts in Vada. The background score includes many classic-cult hits from the time (the movie's set in 1972). It's like a full-blown emotional nostalgic trip, the film. The DVD of My Girl has no extra features but here's why you should buy it. As a child there are many questions that are left unanswered - some your parents want you to figure on your own, some you overhear and some you just never understand. My Girl doesn't set out to answer them - it just allows you to enjoy the unanswered, free-spirited and naive childhood everyone should have. ]"
546,"[That Girl In Yellow Boots isn't a film you can enjoy. It's dark and forthright film, making it an uncomfortable watch. It makes you care for its protagonist and you don't want bad things to happen to her even as you see her make herself go through horrible actions. You feel worse for her because she goes about the moral evils from bribery to sexual acts, in a very matter-of-fact manner. (which also means, you don't watch the film with either your kids or your parents!) Anyway, you can see through her immorality from the things she refuses to do. She's street-smart; she has found her way around mean-machine Mumbai even though she's from UK. And yet you know she's fragile under that cold stare. The writer dug so deep into this one character, that we know her. And that has to be the beauty of an actor being the writer of the story. Kalki Koechlin knows her character Ruth so well, that she takes no time in convincing us that hers is a story that needs to be heard. It also needs to be heard because of the taboo subject it approaches. A topic that needs to be talked about liberally, but is wrapped under covers making the victim feel guilty. In fact, had Ruth's family talked about it, we wouldn't have had this film. (Funny this, I can't talk about it here, because I'll be giving the movie away :)) About ninety out of the hundred minutes are spent with Ruth, trying to find her father. And yet, you don't get bored. That's because of the bunch of characters that Ruth encounters, tolerates and gets past. Almost as if telling us, that the life lessons she is learning will make her a stronger person. And somehow it will all be worth it. From Chitiappa Gauda (Gulshan Devaiya) the much-needed comic relief in the form of a goon to Prashant, Ruth's drug-dealer boyfriend (Prashant Prakash). Amidst this mix of common but not-so-normal characters played by new actors is the reassuring presence of a father figure and familiar face of Naseeruddin Shah. Of course, the fact that I remember the character as Naseeruddin Shah is a tiny failure. But, not a folly that gets overwhelming.Sure, there are a couple of times when the repetitiveness begins to get at you. But at that exact time, a character in the film tells off the annoying character. Bottom line is the film engages you throughout. The dialogue is smart and the delivery by one and all is perfect. I also like how the characters unfold. We come to know about them through the things they do and how they interact. I'm sure most directors would have chosen the voiceover route. This is not the kind of Anurag Kashyap film we are used to. That Girl In Yellow Boots is subtler and calmer. He's not rushing to make his point as if he's not sure he'll get another chance to make it. His angst against the society which wouldn't allow his kind of films to be made has settled a bit. And that has only added to the overall package that the film is. That doesn't mean it doesn't shock you like a trademark Anurag Kashyap film. The ""shock therapy"" could be held against him, but there are some facts about vermin in our society that cannot be told without shocking. Even though I guessed the climax, because of one passing line Ruth says somewhere in the middle of the film, the climax shook me a bit. It could be just because I didn't want it to be how Ruth's story ended. An issue that is close-to-heart, a cold portrayal of the world, and the straightforward as-is style made me uncomfortable, which is a big plus for the film because that was its intention. Yet, unlike other Anurag Kashyap films that I'd urge you to try even if they are not your type, I won't be able to recommend That Girl In Yellow Boots. Because ironically, That Girl In Yellow Boots is not for those who are looking for happy endings. ]"
547,"[Bodyguard's last half hour constantly reminded me of a Chinese curse. May your wish be granted.I had wished for a story in a Salman Khan film and I got it. And there was so much story stuffed into those 30 minutes that I was praying for it to be over. And it refused, as if taunting me, ""you wanted story, you take story! And here take some more."" Fortunately, maybe, all is not lost for Salman Khan fans. There are at least three action packed sequences with slick moves. But somehow, a lot of the credit will be taken by the camera and editing for the ""coolness"".The rest of the time though, he plays the squeaky clean, Lovely Singh. The romance he's involved in drags forever and has a climax that you can laugh out your heart at - not in a good way. And the exact same laughter is brought about every time Salman Khan breaks into a song. No rhyme, no reason, just been a while since the audience has seen Salman Khan move his muscles, so let's edit a song in. The supposedly comic scenes on the other hand barely bring a smile or two. At other times, they bring cringes, especially when the ""comic relief"" side-kick comes on screen. The one thing that I found amusing above all is that Salman Khan is being played around at the hands of a woman. Otherwise, usually the women are thrown around as if they have no brains and are helpless at the hands of their men. That doesn't mean Kareena Kapoor gets a chance to have a pathbreaking performance. She does her usual pretty-young-thing bit, only she gets a little more screen time than otherwise accorded to a non-Salman-Khan in a Salman Khan film. Usually, for a film where only the star of the film matters, I have a disclaimer that the review doesn't apply to the star's fans. But, I doubt even hardcore Salmaniacs will enjoy Bodyguard either. The star however is confident as ever and has a ""I can get away with anything"" attitude. A dialogue in the film goes, ""tumhaari nazar mein tum hero, hamari nazar mein hum hero"" (According to you, you are the hero. According to me, I am the hero). Who would have thought a Salman Khan film could be introspective.]"
548,"[Bol leaves you a huge ""something is missing"" feeling. The kind you can't point your finger at. Given the issue at hand, you are expecting a strong and what they call ""hard-hitting"" film. You know it will get preachy, you know it might be slow, you know it will be grim, so you are prepared for all of that. Given a topic as close to heart as ""girl child"" you want to be sucked into the drama and you want to be brought down to tears. But Bol forgets to engage with its focus on creating drama. Bol's strength lies in its story which revolves around a very important topic. The dire situation of the girl child is not unique to Pakistan or Muslims. In remote corners of India, the same bias against giving birth to a girl child exists and it leads to heinous crimes. Bol creates a story around this issue and shows us the flaws in our society. It presents a different interpretation of the Qoran - the logical one, the one that actually glorifies Allah. An interpretation that should put to shame some of the current practices. The only irony is, in all likelihood, the film will never be seen by the people whose mindsets it wants to fight against. I won't be surprised if those people don't believe in watching films at all. But, while making its point Bol becomes repetitive. And that's strange because it touches on two separate and vast issues and a few other issues like child molestation are touched upon. With so much to talk about, it shouldn't have had to repeat itself. Along with the mistreatment of women, it comments upon transgender issues and their plight. But in showing the reality of how people think about these issues, I'm afraid certain misconceptions are reinforced. For example, how did a midwife know the sexual orientation of a child at birth? Is that possible? Maybe, I don't know enough. Another factor that might have accentuated the disconnect is the performances. The lead actor, Manzar Sehbai the father of the girls who hated having them, had nothing menacing about himself and yet his wife and daughters were scared of him. He is a character we'd love to hate but he didn't even inspire that emotion. In fact, other than the lead lady, Humaima Malick, who plays the brave daughter, none of the actors made me feel anything for them. Even Humaima Malick's otherwise decent performance is watered down by the opening sequence and her spiel from the jail. And yet, Zainub's tale, her all-important question in the climax are enough for me to recommend the film to you. It's a sad and depressing, longish story. The horrifying thing is real-life is only manifold worse than what is shown here.]"
549,"[I can tell you who will love Conan The Barbarian - Bulky, gym-going, Hayabusa driving, testosterone sweating, alpha males whose worst fear is being called Gay. They're afraid to cry, or wear pink, but anything that spells b-l-o-o-d and involves manly barking, is FUN! And keeping with the cliche, Conan The Barbarian is all blood, sweat and low-baritone action. Not to mention, mindless, plotless and painful.Michael Nispel's Conan the Barbarian, which was brought to attention by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1982 version of the film, follows pretty much the same plot (?). Conan (Jason Momoa) is born amidst war, and grows to be a brutal, fearsome warrior. He stands out among his peers because of his mastery with swords. When he returns to his village, he finds it under the hostage of the powerful warlord Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang). The film tracks Conan as he fights for the dignity of his village - rather barbarically. When the film opens with a gruesome scene, at that moment you think it could be a thrilling film - coupled with a story and a reason for us to take a journey through all the fights, blood and tears. However, our dear friend Conan here seems to jump from one fight to another without joining any dots. The entire ""story"" is told to us in a hurried first 10 mins, following which it's ""Dishum!"" - 20 dead, a dance of swords and rivers of blood. Sadly, there's nothing epic or legendary about it. Jason Momoa cannot be taken seriously. Although some credit could be given to costume/make-up, because he certainly looks the part - but someone needs to sit him down and explain to him that screaming his guts out doesn't make him a barbarian (most of the fights are graphically enhanced anyway. No points to acting, if at all) I have friends who have read the Marvel comics of Conan the Barbarian who tell me that the comics are much more detailed, enchanting and grand. They give you a sense of journey, of a real fight. Schwarzenegger's version of the film made him an international star, because the 1982 film had convincing screen savagery, and set a benchmark for raw, rugged action.Conan The Barbarian in 3D however, is repetitive and just boring. It's the same sequences being rotated in this washing machine of a film. A set of bloody, gory war scenes and sinister, half-smirking villains who love evilness just makes for a very frustrating 2 hours. It seems like the makers learnt nothing from their predecessors. The 1982 version has a grand background score, earning immense popularity, given by Basil Poledouris. This Conan The Barbarian - has screams.  Please save yourself from the film. And from this wallet-tearing trend of 3D that is basically another head-ache inducing mechanism. You'd be much better off watching some soap-opera re-run on TV. ]"
550,"[Brittany Murphy was weird looking - she had a cute face, but bug-like eyes. It's a pity she didn't do any horror films in her time, bless her soul. She certainly had the eyes for it. And therefore, I had my reservations about seeing her in a chick flick. So I picked up a rarer film (she's also done Uptown Girls and Clueless), because sometimes you can find the best performances in a film that many haven't heard of.Little Black Book traces Stacy Holt's (Murphy) dream of being a TV anchor. She works as an associate producer on an unsuccessful show - and she has an insecure relationship. Perfect fodder for a witty but fairytale-ending chick flick, right? Well, Little Black Book debases your expectations from the film - which is big win for me. But not in a manner that leaves you spellbound. We walk with Stacy as she spies on her commitment phobic boyfriend, by browsing through his Palm Pilot (Blackberry-type device). With a sloppy pace, we sift through Stacy's insecurities as she meets with each of the ex-girlfriends and meticulously compares herself to them. The funny element in the film enters here. Probably the strongest reason for you to pick up the DVD (if you're in a Sex in The City kind of mood that is) is this entire theme of unapologetic insecurity. Murphy  pulls it off perfectly and the credit goes entirely to her looks. While she meets the girlfriends, there is an entire laugh-worthy voice over that dominates the film. It's raw, unapologetic and director Nick Hurran  does a great job of making the tone absolutely non-judgmental. The DVD of the film has only one feature (among extended trailers and theatrical posters), a making of called ""Live &amp; On The Air: The Making of Little Black Book"". It's a fun, entertaining watch because there's a 3-min interview with Murphy where she's asked if she would indulge in this sort of snooping around. Her calculated, diplomatic answers deliberately hide that tone of guilt which is exactly emblematic of the film. Little Black Book has the same kind of unabashed, satirical tone on self-righteous relationships in the eternal strife to be perfect. That way, the film is unlike most chick flicks. It almost promotes the snooping and the crazy neurotic behavior. In 2009, Murphy died of a cardiac arrest and most remember her as the strangely petite looking girl from films like 8 Mile, or the commercial-singing freak from Clueless. However, it's in Little Black Book that she seems unnervingly charming in all her self-talking, insecure honesty. Little Black Book isn't a great film; it has no real ""story"" which mostly overpowered by the need to make mush moments and be a winner among the chick flick lovers. We have flat performances; the side characters barely contribute, including the boyfriend Derek. But it's in this sloppy film that you can see a sneaky, neurotic and underhand side to a relationship - a truly original interpretation of romance! ]"
551,"[If you get past the delicate-yet-rugged sari-clad woman, stomping around slums shooting people at sight, Shabri is just another underworld/gangster movie. The same old tiff between factions within gangs, the same old fragility between cops and goons. Only difference is a woman gets caught in between all of this for no good reason. When you are done watching Shabri, you will realize that whatever reason there was to get Shabri (Eesha Koppikhar) involved with the hoodlums was only so that somehow they could get an angry young woman involved. It's not like there wasn't an interesting conflict. Shabri does get herself in a soup by estranging both the police and the underworld don. And you wonder how she is going to wade out. Even though you are uninvolved, you are curious as any bystander would be. But unfortunately, the resolution is too simplistic and you can only laugh at the cop-out. And this is a shame because there was so much potential for me to get attached. A woman, whose life isn't enviable as it is, is wronged (for a change it's not rape this once). The hurt only makes her stronger and she uses her anger to change what one might have accepted as destiny. I think this was a sort-of wasted opportunity for Eesha Koppikhar. Who would've imagined her to be cast in a role like this? But unfortunately she is made to hold just one expression through most of the film. And the rare occasions when she emotes a little more than that with a smirk, you realize she is capable of so much more. On the other hand, for what Shabri is going through, I cannot imagine her having anything other than a dead/blank look. Otherwise, her tan make-up was distracting too. It managed to disguise the glamor that she usually carries, and so did her stride, but somehow all of that looked to artificial, too put-on for the sake of the camera. Shabri is grim and brown. At times, it is even tiring because of how much you have to concentrate to figure out what's happening in the low light. The tone given to the regular gang-war story is very serious too. Even if you are looking forward to a story about a woman gangster, I'd say this isn't something worth getting too excited about.]"
552,"[Cameron Diaz is a BAD teacher. Oh and there're no end-of-movie revelations or transformations. She's a horrible teacher, with no real sense of responsibility, character or inclination to be of any help - and that stays. If anything, maybe one can find humor in this fact, because every other gag is either lewd or more lewd. The film is intermittently funny, but what makes Cameron Diaz a watchable film are the characters. Foul-mouthed, greedy and self-obsessed Elizabeth Hasley (Cameron Diaz) is an unapologetic character who's returned to her teaching job at John Adams Middle School after being dumped by her fiance. A wastrel by nature - she ends up showing movies in class for weeks at end, smokes pot in the parking lot and generally doesn't give a rat's... bottom.The pace of the film picks up when the new substitute teacher Scott makes an entry (Justin Timberlake) - he's rich, good-hearted and the best bait for Elizabeth. That's where the theatre begins. She does all it takes to get his attention - from competing with the goody-two-shoes Amy (Lucy Punch) to generally throwing her sexuality around. Meanwhile, she brushes off Gym teacher Russell's advances (Jason Segal of How I Met Your Mother fame)Even if we manage to move past the sporadic pacing of Diaz's character - the logic behind her nature shifts between being extremely rude and sexually explicit within seconds - there's one thing that I couldn't overlook. Not just merely a screenplay flaw, but this just stands as common sense. How Could Anybody Ignore Cameron Diaz (her highness hotness)? The very fact that Diaz has to fight for Timberlake's attention is a big fat question mark on the writing or credibility of the film - especially since with this movie, Diaz is at her sexiest best.Bad Teacher starts out as a fearless, upfront film, but somewhere it loses its plot. The film steers in many directions - at some point you're expecting the scene to get more vulgar but it cuts to a totally unrelated scene. The characters, Timberlake and Segal included, are funny in moments but in larger scheme of things, Bad Teacher heads in no particular direction and exists just for a handful. In the film's defense, you can squirm around in these questions and still enjoy the movie because it doesn't try one bit to be liked. Jake Kasdan is pretty clear in his agenda for Bad Teacher. You hate her so much, you will love the film. Unfortunately he got the first part right - but there's a tiny flaw. You hate  Diaz but you also develop the major hots for her. That might or might not work for the film, but because I can be objective about this, I can tell you that the film is watchable for a few scenes and mostly for Cameron Diaz. She is crass, sexy and downright unapologetic - it's a good film to watch if you're in the mood for a sassy flick about, virtually nothing. ]"
553,"[What can a moment of irrationality make you do? What unspeakable, unthinkable brutality is a human being capable of, if their survival is at risk? How much more evil can the irrationality get if it is out of love, fear or anger? Not a Love Story is a dramatized version of a story that involves a murder. What makes this murder special? It is committed not by a seasoned criminal, neither by a wannabe one. Regular people, people we can see ourselves be friends with, commit the murder and worse, manage the after effects rather cold-bloodedly. And yet, the execution of the film doesn't make you feel for it any more than a newspaper item. I read the news item, shook my head in dismay, and I turned the page.Nevertheless, while I was watching the film, I was involved and interested in what Robin (Deepak Dobriyal) and Anusha (Mahie Gill) go through after a situation led them to murder. Even though, the trailers, gave away the core story. I moved with Anusha as she giggles through pretentiously and  as she faces disappointment after disappointment in landing herself a role in a film. I was unsure of her actions as she was unsure of her own motivations of how she should handle her love life. I was shocked and afraid with her. I could see Robin's love for Anusha through his possessiveness. I saw how he cared for her as he protected her from seeing gore. But, this was only and only because of the outstanding performances. Somehow, this once, I cannot make myself give even part of the credit for the actors' job to the director. One, because how can a person who makes such awful camera and sound/music decisions have anything to do with the performances? And two, I'm not convinced the director had time to direct the actors since he was so busy with the visual and aural quirks. In fact, I must give myself a pat on my back for not letting his gimmicks distracting me from the content of the film. Okay, I'm sure there might have been at least a scene or two where the bottom-up angle or the camera held upside down or the shifty jerky moves it made might have worked towards a scene's impact. But, past experiences with RGV films make me walk into a new film with the intention of ignoring all such trials, and thus I set a block for them all. Oh, and the loud background score - I doubt it worked even in a single scene. I don't understand the use of horror music in a thriller. This also added to what was bothering me throughout the film even though the story, like all stories coming out of life, was interesting and the acting was ace-class. The intention of the film was to fill me with disgust towards what a person like me can be capable of, but the music and camera wanted me to get scared. Moreover, the voyeurism that takes us to Mahie Gills short-skirt hems, the in-the-face B-grade-film-style skin-show make me roll my eyes rather than bringing out the character it is trying to build. All of this took me away from the intent when it had so much potential to draw me closer. Also, in the second half, there was an interesting court drama brewing where three versions of an event came to the forefront. But there is too little time for the game to play out, which would then mean that the film should have been longer. And if there is one thing the film got right, it is the length. So, I'll just be happy with the way the court scenes turned out. In one of those scenes, the horrified disbelief on the faces of Anusha's friends when they find out what happened - it said, ""really? No! That couldn't be."" Would you believe it if one of your acquaintances, let alone friends confessed to murder? That I think is the crux of Not a Love Story. Whatever I derived from the film was despite RGV, and that is his failure. ]"
554,"[There's an archaic law, which needs to be changed to be fair in today's times. The politicians and businessmen are taking advantage of the law and the common man is getting the raw end of the deal. The common man protests. The politicians and businessmen try to thwart the protest using the rulebook to their convenience. Sound familiar? And you thought there is only one such law that our country needs to be fixed. In this instance, we are not talking about an anti-corruption bill, in fact Sahi Dhande Galat Bande is talking about the laws related to Land Acquisition for public use. Unfortunately, it keeps it interesting only so much. And falls flat on its face with its simplistic solution.Sahi Dhande Galat Bande is a mix of themes and styles. It's not that these things can't be mixed well in general, it's just that here, they didn't blend and flow well together. This is a film that makes huge spaces of lush green farms look rugged. Later you have a gun-fight in slow motion with whitewashed/bleached shots. Both stylizations work in their space but when put together in a film, they don't look like one product. Sahi Dhande Galat Bande also tries to make a point. But, the point is ages old and there isn't a new way in which the film makes it. Fortunately, though the dilemmas the main character is made to go through are half-promising. And you are looking forward to how he is going to resolve it. It's a different matter that you are let down. But, getting there is fun and interesting. The performances are all good and in character. If only, the writers dwelled a little more on characters other than the lead and brought out a little more color to their personalities. Because they looked like they had interesting facets, only we were not privy to them. Maybe the only reason Sahi Dhande Galat Bande got me interested is the relevance of  the topic is given this week's events in the country. I wonder what would have come of it if the release date wasn't coincidentally so close to Anna's protest against corruption. Surely, I doubt it has potential to ruffle too many feathers even now, because of the marketing budget constraints and the lackluster way in which it's done. But it might do well as the debut film of a director. ]"
555,"[Before anything, Gautam Menon's Vinnaithandi Varuvaya (Will You Cross the Skies for Me) makes you understand what falling in love at first sight is all about. It might not convert you, but you'll get it. The cult film, also known as VTV, and A. R. Rahman's first project after the Oscar hype, is a beautiful, uncomplicated love story between people from different religions. You might find the plot a little too simple, you might not agree with the outcome - but the beauty of VTV lies in its ability to suck you in and make you understand the plight of the characters. Karthik (Silambarasan) and Jessie (Trisha Krishnan) live in different floors of a two-storied house in Chennai. Jessie is a tradition Christian girl, who wouldn't dream of being even slightly rebellious. Karthik is a mediocre guy, who has ambitious plans of becoming a filmmaker. Gautam Menon doesn't take much time in establishing the blazing chemistry between the two; being opposites yet having a strong pull towards one another. Ofcouse, there's a conflict. She belongs to a strict Christian household, and she's absolutely sure they have no future. And predictably so - Karthik doesn't sit back. He pursues her, and he makes her fall in love with him. Typical filmy material right? Wrong. Menon spins his own visual spool to explain the love to us - mostly through Kathik's thoughts manifested in dance sequences and surreal love-struck conversations with himself.  Thought bubbles keep running through your mind. Why can't they just get together or why is Karthik so persistent about Jessie? We see Jessie through his eyes - she becomes the audience's muse as well, and so when he continuously asks himself, ""Of all the girls, why did I have to fall in love with Jessie"" - there are no answers provided but you know why. Rahman's music has a contemporary sound in the film - with echoes, choruses and thin voices - the songs become like melodic thoughts, be it the infatuated 'Hosanna', or the deeply lyrical 'Mannipaya'. The songs become a space for each character to sing out their stream of consciousness. The credit for this goes to Menon, for being able to use Rahman's music and Thamarai (lyricist) words to capture the character's contemplation and make it into a visual narrative of soulful melodies. The DVD of Vinnaithandi Varuvaya has no special features as such - but a good set of comprehensive subtitles and thankfully no loss in quality, because the film should be enjoyed for the visual treat that makes us fall, rise and celebrate the love being portrayed in the film.The best part about VTV however, is not the portrayal of love but in its ability to make you observe a positive angle through the struggle of love. VTV is as much a story of the frustrations and rejections  - but you empathize and relate with the characters without that dash of misogyny that most story-tellers might tend to use. That's where Menon's vision needs to be applauded, to be able to present a well-rounded story and make it strikingly about the love, the visual memories, and the characters and less about the struggle. The frustration is treated as a skipping stone in the trajectory of love. Eventually, as they toil to cross seas or skies for their love - they manage to draw a pretty darn good picture of it. ]"
556,"[Death did not enjoy the extended weekend, with Final Destination 5 releasing in 3D. Death (personified rather creepily by Tony Todd, the only recurring member of the series) had to perform its seasonal rituals, against those who defied the rules of the cosmic universe. It was Independence Day for some, and a gruesome travel to their 'final destination' for an unfortunate few. It's been 12 years since the first Final Destination movie blew us away, with its clever premise and not much has changed plot wise, with the fifth installment. Since the first bunch of people escaped the Flight 180 crash, Death has been standing guard - through 4 more films - at anybody who dare defy the cosmic laws of the universe. One by one, each person gets scratched out and you can't help but think of Death as a Death Eater prototype, sitting in a grey cloud with a notepad of all the names. However, 5 movies later, a clever premise has now been transformed into a grotesque, gory parade of jaw droppers. You could easily watch the entire movie through the slit between your fingers, while your hand covers your eyes. If you've followed the series from the first film, you will sense a slight disappointment. But for those of you who are just in for the blood and gore, Final Destination 5 is money well spent. Final Destination 5 has a brand new cast, mostly from television series. Sam (Nicolas D'Agosto, from Heroes) is the one who sees a premonition about a breaking bridge. The lucky few who manage to escape include Emma Bell (The Walking Dead) playing Sam's girlfriend; Miles Fisher (Gossip Girl) also Sam's coworker and best friend; and P.J.Byrne (Horrible Bosses) as a distant co-worker. Director Steven Quayle, also James Cameron's protege, leaves no stone unturned with regard to visual effects. For once, the usage of 3D is justified, when the characters are all burnt, boiled, poked, laser-ed to death. While the premise remains ( rather predictably at that), somehow you feel through the years, this franchise has become more about the blood and gore than about visually playing out one of the most interesting concepts to come out of the movies.The cinematography is in line with the genre, we intercut between slow establishing scenes and fast-paced cuts of the death scenes. The film maintains a blue tone, and when coupled with eerie background score provides a true horror experience. If you get time to think between flying objects whooshing at you and blood drops splattering across the screen, you'll realize the film approaches the most superficial part of your psyche - and so, it becomes that much more important to bring that out to discuss. It's a typical discussion; one which adopts a to-each-their-own fixation. If you like such films, this one's a good weekend investment. But somewhere you will realize the film could have taken another direction - one that dealt with the topic of death and destiny, more symbolically and thematically. ]"
557,"[The ""huh!?"" expression I've carried ever since the film ended is now expanded into a full question - If just the title of a film can cause an outrage big enough for the film to be banned in some areas of the country, what will happen if the film actually ends up being about the issue it is named after? We'll have to wait for another film to find out. Unless, of course, half of Aarakshan was reshot to make it ""not"" about reservations. After a half-an-hour full of songs, the characters are introduced and the base story is established. And then you hear the perfectly logical and valid sides of the quota-system debate amongst students and teachers, between authorities in education and media, husband and wife, father and daughter. And you are completely sucked into the drama. Only to be let loose very soon, to make sense of a confusion that the writer/director seem to have gone through - confusion about which story to tell. Aarakshan (with a different name) could have been a touching tale of a principled crusader, Dr. Prabhakar Anand (Amitabh Bachchan) who just refuses to be put down. His fight is not as much against the government's policy about reservation but against the businessmen who have made education a profitable transaction. And that concept alone has enough weight to make a movie by itself. I mean, I could have very easily let go of the title and readjusted my frame of mind to accept the story of the lovable, ideal teacher, Prabhakar. But, Aarakshan is too black and white to convince me. Sure, Prabhakar is not all good, and you see that through his daughter's eyes. But his righteousness is too overwhelming to let us see this not-so-white side. The other characters caving in to his goodness doesn't help either. His nemesis, Mithilesh (Manoj Bajpai) is outright black and makes you want to slap him, alright. The other characters have their shades of gray but they don't have enough screen time to let us appreciate them. Yep, including Deepak (Saif Ali Khan) and Poorbi (Deepika Padukone). And this is worse considering that the movie is two hours and forty-five minutes long. And even though, the performances by Amitabh Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, and Manoj Bajpai are enough to pull you through the saga, each of them has a caveat. Manoj Bajpai loses control in the climax without any build-up towards his breakdown. Saif Ali Khan has all of two scenes to make his point. And this is something Amitabh Bachchan can do half asleep. And I cannot stop admiring how the man, with his stature in the industry, can still portray the common man with drooped, burdened shoulders. If only, there was one film that would make us feel, ""this"" is why he does films. If only, this film had what it said it had. I was looking forward to a deeper understanding of the issue, I got songs. I was told an amazing cast will put up the two sides of the issue out on the big screen, they just came in and went out (just like the issues) with no flow and justifications. I was promised a film that will shake up the sleeping common man into action, but I got a solution that was no better than what the villains of the film were upto. And all of this was accompanied with loud background music which took away the little that the dialogues were building up to. ""Quiet Easily Done"" the film says repeatedly whenever Math students want to say, ""quod erat demonstrandu""referring to the acronym q.e.d. Aarakshan demonstrates how centuries of wrong done to certain castes can be quite easily undone. And maybe they are right. Most complex problems in life do have simple solutions. All we, the gullible audience, need to do is get together as a mass and protest. And yes, make that one call to the highest authority we can reach to solve our problem for us. Simple. Yep, that's the laughable solution Aarakshan gives us. Now, whose number do we dial to ask the politicians to call off the ban publicity stunt that the Aarakshan team just pulled. ]"
558,"[A medium - the person used by the paranormal to communicate - is trying to convince a doctor that she can use her mystical powers to find his missing wife. He tells her that makes no sense. She says, ""Do you want logic or wife?"" And that pretty much sums up what the writer wants to tell us, ""Do you want logic or movie?"" For example, this medium person can sense stuff by touching people on TV screens but not sense a walking-talking spirit. The proceedings are slow, the acting is bad. Everytime Adah Sharma said, ""I am a medium."" I felt like saying out loud, ""well, you look like a large."" Yep, that bad! And it's sad because one scene Adah Sharma had in 1920 is etched in my memory for the way it spooked me. But here, nothing is spooking or even remotely thrilling. The attempt at creating mystery with all the non-linear back and forth was unnecessary and rather amusing after a point, unintentionally of course. The background score is noisy. In ""tense"" situations, there was this weird competition between tamsoma sadgamaya and loud Bollywoody-hip-hop music that said ""maahi ve"", no less! I am no filmmaker, neither do I aspire to be, but I really want to understand the psyche behind this decision. But then, I'd want to understand why this film was made in the first place. If it were to make us aware of the power of the supernatural, it defies its purpose. The supernatural was warning against all the wrong things, all through the film. Unfortunately, the production values of the film are so bad that you cannot even have fun laughing at the film. It's not like we haven't seen worse but it surely is one of those that you should make a point to save yourself from.]"
559,"[You would think a 7.1 IMDB rating and a cast line-up including Vinne Jones (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) is a good enough reason to pick up a film - more so a film about secretive riddles going back to Charles Dickens. When I picked up the DVD of The Riddle I thought to myself, this should be a nail-bitter. My nails are bitten anyway, but that's because I was bored - and therefore I present to you this disclaimer. Don't Never judge a book by its cover.  Having said that - let me allow you to get blown away by the synopsis, also the only gripping part of the film. The Riddle is a contemporary mystery thriller that sparks off with a woman's murder, after she finds an unpublished Charles Dickens manuscript. We see the film through the eyes of Mike (Vinne Jones) who is an aspiring investigative journalist. While he is tracking down the script, we are escalated into the world of yesterday, and only after they unlock the mystery of yesterday, will they be able to solve today's crime.Unlike what it seems The Riddle does not have a labyrinthine pace, where everything folds one after another in quick succession.  After sitting through the film that sounds positively intelligent, you keep wondering if you've missed something, maybe you're not getting the layers after all. All those thoughts will vanish with the climax. I wouldn't call it a joke, but after you've pulled yourself together for almost 2 hours, you're hoping all will be redeemed with a revelation in the end - but you get zilch. It's almost too ridiculous to be true.The film could have been passable had the writers taken themselves a little less seriously - maybe made a genuine thriller that follows a simple pattern of establishing-churning-revealing. On the other hand, what The Riddle does is get absorbed in its own arrogance, sunken too deep into what they think is a fabulous story. Vinne Jones is a tad bit wasted, although his acting seems earnest. The look and feel of the film does match up to its era (with the production design and the costumes) with deep blacks and grungy hues. Sadly you'd be able to notice all of this only if you can move past the ghastly play of events that the film has to offer. And therefore, the writing is the main problem with The Riddle. The crime scenes are fairly played out well, with the sound effects and background score. It could have been a half decent film had the writing been cross-checked at a development stage.The only extra in the DVD is an extended trailer of the film, which honestly is the best part of the entire DVD. The trailer is crisp, sounds and looks good and has the core concept of the film down to perfection. My humble suggestion would be to remake the film, taking it from the trailer and making it more coherent, tight and mildly entertaining at points. Not because one needs those elements to enjoy a film, but for this plot it's necessary to carry the add-ons. It's a hard task to offer a critique of a film which is fundamentally all wrong. You don't know how to deconstruct it further and go deep into the layers to offer suggestions. But one of the main reasons why I decided to go this was to bring a crucial point to everyone's attention. Some bad films should have never been made but there are some films that have interesting concepts and the problem mostly lies with execution. The Riddle belongs to the latter category.Also, for future reference, please evaluate a film with your own rating. ]"
560,"[The guy who sells 3D glasses at the ticket counter must be thanking his stars right now. Every Friday a new film is added to his list of 3D films - the demand is increasing. To him, it doesn't matter that most films are not shot in 3D, hence they end up with projection problems, dim viewing due to the tint of the glasses, and not to mention a headache that most walk out with. When news of The Lion King being released in 3D came around, there was panic. The original film released in 1994, uses traditional hand-drawn animation, which is 2D is nature. There was my childhood; virtually every moral lesson I imbibed, being re-released in 3D. Anybody would panic. But I had to watch it, it was a compulsive need - to compare and rant and crib about what the world had come to, in the name of commercialization (which is a bit hypocritical, I realized, because I owned every merchandise of the Lion King that existed.)Viewing the movie, however, makes you forget all of that. The epic sense of the film comes thoroughly, with the 3 D version (provided the projection is up to mark) and because it offers a new dimension to viewing the film, the re-release works. However, the experience is only mildly different; if you're a fan of things flying at you and the sense of grandeur that you would inevitably get with the 3D effect then, the 3D version will  give you your money's worth.  The Lion Kingis set in an anthropomorphic jungle in Africa called Pride Rock - where the royal family headed by King Mufasa is loved and respected by all. Life in the jungle is dutiful and simple and the movie begins with the birth of Mufasa's son Simba. The family's rival, Scar (also Mufasa's brother) is constantly trying to overpower him to become the king. The film traces their story - of love, betrayal and honour.For those of you who have already watched the film many times over, the same points will make you cry, Scar and the hyenas will still manage to scare you, Simba and Nala's growing love over Elton John's classic 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight' will still make you smile with fondness and you will still feel a void when you walk out of the movies - at the end of the 2 most precious hours of nostalgia.Funnily enough, the voice-overs of side characters include familiar names like Rowan Atkinson (voice of Zazu, Mufasa's right hand) and Whoopi Goldberg (voice of the female hyena in Scar's army) and the background score is given by Hans Zimmer. Elton John and Time Rice have written and composed 5 songs in films - all of which have been re-touched and performed countless times at Broadway and live concerts. It would take you an entire day to listen to the various versions of the songs.For many (including me)The Lion King being released in 3D was essentially a revisit to our childhood - of days when Disney was about 2D animation and classic cartoons, and a time when we hadn't heard of Hanna Montana or The High School Musical trilogy. Re-releasing the film in 3D, undoubtedly gives you that added advantage of watching the film on the big screen with effects and wholesome viewing experience. Otherwise, The Lion Kingin 3D includes your favorite moments, your favorite characters and another excuse to watch your favorite film, regardless of the visual dimension]"
561,"[I am Kalam is a beautiful film. It romanticizes friendships, loneliness, class divides, political borders, ambition and of course roadside dhaabas and Rajasthan too. If only, the story held a little stronger or had a little more depth than aspiring young boy struggles to get what he wants. I am Kalam is mainly the tale of young Chhotu who has given himself an alias - Kalam - after the former president of India.  Dr. A. P. J Abdul Kalam is this little boy's inspiration. This little boy who works at a roadside dhaba cheerfully instead of grunting about going to school. He wants to go, but he can't afford to. As expected, the film has emotional moments and a strong message. But the moments are endearing and the message is well-hidden under a basic, sensitive story. However, the story is a little more than just the story of Chhotu. It has other characters and their personalities that represent an older generation that has lost all hope and a part of Gen X from the interiors of India - the lazy, insecure and mean part. These digressions take away from the film because the approach to these side-stories is half-hearted. I don't have material to empathize with Bhati (Gulshan Grover) or to want to give Laptan (Pitobash) one hard slap. And this is despite the fact that they have given awesome performances. You see the humility in Gulshan Grover's eyes and Pitobash annoys appropriately. But I don't care to love or hate them. The cuts in the film, that take you to their stories, give you the feeling that in the urge to keep the running time down, the makers gave up on the flow. The choppiness was disconcerting. And so was the side-story of the kings from the yesteryears who have lost their glory. Fortunately, what matters is that Harsh Mayur who plays the protagonist is ever-so appealing with the twinkle in his eye. The rags he wears matter not, because of the wide grin he strides with. The spring in his step make you even more aware of his dire situation and the lesson or two you can learn from him. Both the actor and the character are equally responsible for the fine experience that Chhotu is. And yet, the main story has a lot to say and I am Kalam says it with love. Its strength is in the subtlety with which it raises a question. What is chhotu thanking Kalam for? How would Dr. Kalam react if he actually met chhotu who labors at his tender age? ]"
562,"[A film supposedly about the common man represented by Mussaddi did not make me identify with him, even though I've gone through situations as Mussaddi. What could be a bigger failure of the film?Have there been times when you are watching a film and there is a side-story interesting enough that makes you say, ""wow, that can be a film by itself."" Looks like, the makers of Chala Mussaddi - Office Office had a similar epiphany when they were watching Lage Raho Munnabhai's pensioner scene. Unfortunately, they have made an awfully pale tale out of it. A tale that a talent like Pankaj Kapoor couldn't do anything to help. I look forward to Pankaj Kapoor films and somehow even as I watched the trailer of Chala Mussaddi - Office Office, I cringed at the stereotypical babu (bureaucrat) representation. The irony is that had I heard just the concept, it would have excited me. I don't think there can be enough films made about how deeply engrained corruption is. But we don't really want our films to be an exaggerated and repetitive staging of reality. The characters are all caricatures and the regular amount of disgust-inducing. While I liked the fact that the same actors appeared in various roles, there was no theme to it and soon that too became boring. The one good thing about the film is that characters don't suddenly transform. The good-for-nothings and dishonest remain so. No amount of speeches and appeals move the hard-hearted bureaucrats. It can also be said that the climax is sort-of, kind-of redeeming because of the circular reference it gets into. Also, it takes the action to a high after the recurring theme of Mussaddi going from office to office to get what is rightfully his in the first place. But, then again the answer is too idealistic and simplistic.Then again, maybe the solution is simple. Maybe our work against corruption starts at home with simple things. Maybe the point is to not let the problem become so big that we have to stage a theatrical climax as our solution. Sorry to digress though, these thoughts of mine are despite this inconsequential film. ]"
563,"[Not all covers/remixes mean butchering a sanctified song, or including unnecessary add-ons. If handled aesthetically, some covers can bring a contemporary touch to a beautiful melody - but be warned, you need an open mind to appreciate them. It's a different story however, with a film that's in honor of the Beatles. Your first thought on Across The Universe would be exactly what the film gives you - lots of beatles' tracks, a musical love story and every shot as a homage to the legendary band - with names of the characters (Jude, Lucy, Sadie, Prudence), street names (Abbey Road) and silly little references in the dialogue.Across The Universe follows a personal relationship between Jude (Jim Sturgess) and Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) and is placed against the backdrop of the Vietnam War - a typical, grand love story which is forwarded by 33 Beatles songs. It's experimental and a must-see for any Beatles fanatic because that's just what we do - scrutinize anything and everything remotely related to the band - songs, documentaries, books and the works. The enjoyable thing about the film, however is that it brings much to the table for those who haven't been crazy fans. Since it's an out an out musical, the songs add the sense of drama to film. Across The Universe has an eclectic look (with costumes and the production design) that matches the psychedelic zone of the film set in the late 60s, and even though the story is simplistic, it's universal in nature.Where the film wins however, is in its ability to bring to the viewer more than just another visual representation of the songs - presumably the same songs they've been hearing for years. How well they've been covered is a topic for another review, but most tracks add a new dimension to the song - With underwater sequences spilling into Ballet, stage performances that turn into a war scene adding an avant garde touch to the film. Here's an example - I Want to Hold Your Hand  is originally an upbeat, peppy song about yearning love and in the movie when Prudence sings the cover in a slow, melodic manner (right after a teary scene) it becomes a yearning song about a hand she might never hold. There are many tracks in the move that allow for respectful deconstructions of timeless songs for a renewed understanding. For that reason alone this visual homage to the Beatles' works. The 2 disc DVD set is like a goldmine - featuring the art from the film, an audio commentary from the director Julie Taymor (also the Broadway director of The Lion King) where she talks about why she needed to make a film and not a broadway show with , lots of deleted scenes, a 6-min long featurette on the usage of visual effects in the film and the best part - all 33 covers of the songs. You would think making a film like this would be fighting a losing battle. The ongoing debate about whether covers are good/bad/satisfactory doesn't end with Across The Universe, but it takes some nerve to visualize a film that basically originates from 33 cover tracks. Across The Universe has its own personality, not a very gripping story but that's pardonable and you'll most certainly be humming a tune or two once the movie is over. If you find yourself liking a song better than the original don't be afraid -  Let Yesterday Be, and buy the DVD. ]"
564,"[Terence Malick's Palme D'or winner Tree of Lifedemarcates its audience into two - the kind that has the patience to watch a tree grow over the years and the kind that will keep coming back every 10 years to quickly monitor its progress. But both kinds acknowledge the magnificence of the tree.Tree of Life is a film that unfolds slowly. In all its passion, whispers, colors and surrealist imagery it tries to tell you the story of a family, and how they grapple with life and death. But it's not a grim existential crisis, the movie talks about nature and about grace (personified by the father and mother, played by Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain.)The imagery is all-encompassing poetry. We pass through the life of a family living in an American suburb in the 50s, through the eyes of the younger son,  Jack (Sean Penn), who struggles to find answers for his brother's death, his mother's soft charm, his father's disciplinarian demeanor and how that all cumulates into life.We bustle through old-school visuals with watercolors, smokes, liquids, paints and dyes - all of which take us through a symbolic, colorful and magnanimous process of how life originated. It's a montage of  waterfalls, and erupting lava, amoebae forming, reproduction of every species and every aspect of nature scanned beautifully. The most refreshing twenty minutes in the film, mostly because the visuals are old-school and thankfully we aren't subjected to high-end visual effects and graphics.We keep sifting through patient and extravagant shots of nature, of life in general and intercutting visuals of the O'Briens' lives. It's a film about life, and it's a preachy film but each shot manages to take your breath away. Coupled with the gospel like background score and divine cinematography, the audio-visual experience is almost sublime.However, the narrative structure is leisurely and repetitive; you feel like a slither of a water color, trickling down as slowly as possible, never stopping but moving sporadically. You'll notice the religious undertones of redemption and forgiveness, you'll see life through a supreme being's eyes, but you'll also zone out amidst all the lovely visuals because the film is basically like an extremely poetic sermon. Some words stun you, some inspire, but some just bore you.If you're looking for a glimmer of intimacy, inspiration and just to be awed by the naturalness of life, Tree of Life gives you that. The film will motivate you to cleanse your soul, introspect, restructure your life around the beauty that this world is and all that.You'll just need lots of patience to move with the film.]"
565,"[We all have aspirations of how to deal with a mid-life crisis: Red/yellow sport cars, travel to an exotic location and the works. Maybe change career paths; follow our dreams - anything that works. Shah Rukh Khan does it, with every ""guest appearance"" or ""endorsement"" while Kevin Spacey's character in American Beauty is a benchmark of what we shouldn't do. What do you do however, when you face an intense identity crisis at 40?Helen Hunt's Then She Found Me  is a quirky, modernist take on a mid-life crisis of a woman who finds her biological mother at the age of 40 and her life changes. Then She Found Me  is Hunt's debut as a director.Through the confusions and the chaos, Miss Epner (Hunt) dabbles with a mother, and a rather loud and famous one at that, a spineless ex-husband, a new relationship and a life-changing identity crisis.Then She Found Me  is one of those films where nothing really ground breaking happens, but you get hooked onto the story as it unfolds one stupendously crazy incident after another. Just when you get used to shocking revelations like finding a mother at 40 and getting dumped when least expected, a voice-over trails you through a much larger catastrophe. Funnily enough, you're never made to sit and grieve anything. The entire tone of the film can be watered down to one sentence - ""Okay Life, how much worse can this get?"" And there's never a boundary to that! One after another, we are made to spiral down incident after incident of turbulent discoveries and funny connections, until we reach a point where it all binds to give sense of closure. Closure is the ideal end to a film like this - because it satiates you, as viewer after taking a crazy adventure ride that the film is.The look and feel of Then She Found Me  is contemporary, satirical and subtly funny in a way that makes your Laugh Out Loud in your head, but never burst out laughing for real. It's a different brand of funny, coupled with a smooth background score and interesting, intercutting cinematography - all which makes sense when coupled with the scene in question.The DVD of Then She Found Me   isn't a goldmine though, with just a few trailers, extended scenes and a interview with Helen Hunt on her first time as a director and her experience of writing the film. The interview is a decent watch while Hunt talks about her choice of this script for her debut film, and how it uses understated humour to define a state of mind. Then She Found Me  is an underdog. We all want a raving DVD collection with films we can boast about - if the films are unheard of, even better. This film isn't something you can boast about, or even use as a conversation catalyst in intellectual discussion about art &amp; cinema but you'll finish the film with a genuine smile on your face hoping you have the nerve to live through your mid-life crisis in a similar manner. ]"
566,"[Within the first few minutes of Gandhi To Hitler, you know that any expectations you might have had of it being a decent film are going to be mercilessly squashed. Sure, if you sit through almost two hours and you could attempt to appreciate what the film might be trying to do. It tries to bring out what any war film worth its salt would want to demostrate - the futility of war. And it tries to say that even the worst of human beings, is after all, human. But arriving at these deductions requires a lot of effort and patience.While trying to talk about what I didn't like about Gandhi To Hitler, I'm going to try and ignore the laughable use of language. I take a HUGE leap of faith, when I hear Hitler speak a mix of Hindi and Urdu with what is supposedly a German accent. And I don't know if that is worse or better than Raghuvir Yadav quote Shakespeare with awful diction. Each one of the actors, except maybe Neha Dhupia made me want to cry out of despair. Yet, let's say we let that go. And it does become easier to let it go, with the distorted narrative, hotchpotch editing, and convoluted connections in the story. Gandhi To Hitler is set between 1939 and 1945. I guess it tries to display the devastation of Hitler's reign. But how am I supposed to appreciate what he went through when he was betrayed by his senior officials when they have shown me nothing about their loyalty or his trust. What do I care about his breakdown, when I know nothing of him from his heyday? And the distractions from what seems like the main story are extremely annoying. The shift of focus from Hitler or Balbir (a soldier from Subhash Chandra Bose's army) to the angst that the ones who love them go through doesn't serve any purpose. But to draw the parallel, that both these men who believed in violence didn't really have any redeeming quality that would make them lovable. They seemed largely inconsiderate towards their women. And in between a war film, you have characters preaching love and family values. The umpteen voiceovers, text superimposes, the stock footage, the grainy and sepia texture all made Gandhi To Hitler look and feel like a documentary. How I wish, it was a well-made, adequately-researched, thoroughly-thought-out documentary. Gandhi's track was almost 100% voiceover. Hitler's track had too many people with a layer of thick, visibly bad, make-up. Not to mention costumes in this period drama that most likely didn't belong to the period. I'm no expert, but crisp, cotton, chickenkari dresses (for the children) looked out-of-place in Germany of the 1940s. And Balbir's track - if I don't feel empathy when Indian soldiers are being shot at, and they are in an awful situation for no fault of theirs, what has the film achieved? Are we sure the main reason for this track was not to elongate the run-time and make room for some lip-sync song-and-dance routines? And pushing itself forward to seek your attention is a fourth track - the background score. It had an agenda of its own. I couldn't figure what it was though. That is exactly what Gandhi To Hitler felt like. A deliberate or even desperate trial at joining the dots between whatever little we know about the last few months of Hitler's life. A forced attempt at making a connection between Gandhi and Hitler. An aimless account in the endeavor to be ""different"".I feel sad for the writer and the director. They thought they set out on a project that would bring a lot of meaning to the people who indulge them. But, this indulger came out feeling pity for them. ]"
567,"[I couldn't review Khap because it didn't release in Pune. And looks like I didn't miss much. Thank you, Danish, for covering this one for wogma! - meetuHonestly? Is it really that difficult to make a compelling, intelligent movie based on or inspired from real life incidents? 'Khap' should easily make a worthy case study as to how our filmmakers set off on ""good intentions"" only to turn a serious and deep issue into giggle worthy melodramatic drivel. So keeping in line with the USP of the site, I won't give any details about the plot other than a brief outline. An estranged son, Madhur (Mohnish Behl) who works for the National Human Rights Commission, returns to his village after sixteen years to investigate honour killings supposedly carried out at the behest of the Khap Panchayat. Madhur's father Omkar Chaudhary (Om Puri) is one of the heads of the Panchayat and father and son don't exactly see eye-to-eye on many issues with the son taking a firm stand against the practice of honour killings. So after much posturing and speeches back &amp; forth about the ""pros &amp; cons"" of Khap Panchayats and honour killings, cinematic co-incidence rears it's ugly head in the form of Madhur's daughter, Ria who elopes with a boy of the same gotra. Boy oh boy! Get those pitchforks and torches ready.Last year Priyadarshan tried to tackle a similar topic with Mississippi Burning Aakrosh which again made a mockery of things by inserting such ""credible"" sequences in which Ajay Devgn slides under a moving train and stands atop a moving car dodging branches; but keeping the inherent silliness aside both Aakrosh &amp; Khap suffer from a serious lack of research &amp; good writing. Both seem content in painting a sensationalist picture of some serious issues which has more depth than the screenplay of any of these movies accords it; characters &amp; situations aren't credibly fleshed out but pointless love-songs run amok. I guess this kind of treatment does make you wonder what ""good intentions"" were the makers referring to. I have no love for the Khaps or their ways but can't help but find their portrayals utterly one-dimensional; sneering, glaring, moustachio-ed, hookah smoking men talk about prathas &amp; hamara kanoon. The movie tries to overcome this problem by presenting Om Puri with a moral dilemma thus setting him up for an inevitable cultural transformation. However it's the lecturing back and forth between all characters that gets tiresome and preachy thus never allowing any of them to grow beyond paper-thin cliches; moral one, amoral one, misguided one, turned a new leaf one, blood-thirsty one...you see? The romantic track lays waste to what little chance of redemption laid with the other dramatic elements of the movie. It's so bad &amp; unconvincing that it almost makes you root for the Khap Panchayat to administer whatever punishment they deem fit and end our suffering right away. The camerawork, background score &amp; art direction will remind you of television grade material the onus of which lies solely with director Ajai Sinha, who was the man behind TV soaps such as Hasratein and Astitva- Ek Prem Katha. So, he brings the same small-screen sensibilities to this project, effectively making a two-hour pilot for a future TV series instead of a feature film. Khap fails on every front, it's ineffective as a social commentary, it's overlong and preachy (not to mention unintentionally funny), it's saddled with a love story which you hope ends as soon as it begins, though I would highly recommend Alok Nath's little monologue about the dangers of inter-gotra marriages, it was the piece de resistance of the film and might be the funniest bit of cinema you might watch all year long.  What was supposed to send a shiver down your spine is more likely to tickle your funny bone or simply put you to sleep; avoid it at all costs.]"
568,"[I couldn't review Bubble Gum because it didn't release in Pune. And such a shame that is, for my guest reviewer IdeaSmith loved it and has some really good things to say about it. Here's hoping you can catch it. - meetu * When the promos for Bubble Gum first flashed on my TV screen, I changed the channel. I figured that the title was a description of the superficial lives of over privileged kids who date at 12, have their own cars at 14 and a passport stamped with all the fashionable destinations, by the time they are 16. Indeed, if Meetu hadn't asked me to do a guest-review, this movie might have passed from my notice. The loss would have been entirely mine.The promos and posters tell you that this is a story of puppy love and teenage friendships. I'm almost loath to say any more since it would go counter to reviewing without giving the movie away (Oh Meetu, this is so hard!). Let me start by saying that my perceptions were entirely wrong. This is not bubblegum of the fancy 'Oh, I lurrrrve San Francisco, I got this tee-shirt at Disneyland on my last visit' crowd. It's the bubblegum of the local-brand-chews-like-eraser variety that anyone who grew up in India of the 80s would remember. The story is set in a time before mobile phones, satellite television and neighborhood coffee bars. Bubble Gum starts with this simple introduction and explains how at that time, the most one could expect from love was a stolen glimpse of the beloved or a surreptitious hand clasp during kabaddi.Bubble Gum explores the world of 14-year-old, Vedant in Jamshedpur in the days drawing up to Holi. A grown-up Vedant (who is never shown) narrates the tale, giving it a very 'The Wonder Years' feel. The movie touches on every aspect of the boy's life so artfully that anyone who is or has ever been fourteen will feel a sense of kinship. Vedant chafes under parental authority, has an ongoing war with his arch rival Ratan, sighs deeply over the pretty girl next door and is frequently bailed out of scrapes by his brother, Vidur. So what makes this teenager, this story special? For starters, it is the first Hindi movie in recent times, about this age group. It's not a cutesy monsters-and-noises tale for a primary school child. Nor does it have the teeny-bopper flavour of a number of other recent releases, which target either older teenagers or 'the cool set', focusing exclusively on puppy love. Infatuation is only one of the things that concern a preteen/early teenager and it is accorded the same status in Bubble Gum. Peer pressure, sibling jealousy and detachment from the parental unit are also major aspects of a young adult's life and Bubble Gumexplores each of these without ever turning preachy or predictable.Secondly, every character, even a minor one, is etched in the kind of detail that makes a story truly delightful. You watch most of the movie through Vedant's eyes but you also recognize his parents' dilemma and his brother's blind protectiveness. You even feel certain camaraderie with the roguish, rough-and-ready Ratan. Even characters who only appear in a couple of scenes add to the funny nostalgia value as they make the audience think of someone just like that from their own lives - the rakhi sister who is a go-between for the lovers, the pushy Bengali mother combing her hair on the balcony, ready to take up cudgels on her Partho's behalf, the gulal-seller who moonlights as a goon, the baby brother who must and can be bribed with chocolate, to play messenger.One of the major aspects of this movie has not been detailed in the promos and in keeping with the theme of this blog, I won't mention it either. You'll know it when you see it, in the first five minutes of the film. All I'll say is that it's been done only a few times in Bollywood and never quite as well as this.As it turns out, Bubble Gumis only being screened at a select few theatres. Of the multiplexes, PVR Cinemas is the only one in Mumbai that I could find with a show and even then, only a single one per theatre in the morning. There must have been a special screening for schools since there were two groups of children present with their teachers in tow in the audience. You would think that a theatre full of preteen kids would make for a raucous audience. But the movie kept us all glued to our seats, with only an occasional cheer or laugh at Vedant's adventures.I thought Bubble Gum would be the perfect group outing movie for a bunch of preteens. My mother who accompanied me to the film, thought it would be an interesting watch for parents of teenagers. And though neither of us is a part of those two groups, we each still immensely enjoyed the film.]"
569,"[Singham desperately wants to highlight the power of numbers. Especially when the number is actual people who are frustrated with the system they have become a part of. Singham says, if we believe in this power nothing is unachievable. Well, this is not the first story that wants us to believe, nothing is beyond a ""united"" people - be it media, police or the common man. I'm not going to complain about how simple Singham's solutions are or how idealistic too. The problem is, the wagon it uses to make its point. It is action comedy. It is cool inside the theater and forgotten outside. To top it off, all the ""smart action"" parts, you've already seen in the trailers.Singham would have worked a little better if they had a little more action than the one we had already seen because I remember being in complete awe of the muscular Ajay Devgn running in slo-mo, getting off a swinging jeep. It was creative and held my attention. The entire feature though, is held together by a very slow set-up, choppy flow and unbelievable character transformations to make the climax. It is weird to assess a particular sequence or character when you like the concept of what's playing itself out but you are laughing at the far-fetched actions and reactions. I guess it's because you just wish some of the things happening were true. Other than these things though, there were a few immensely likeable elements in Singham. One is ofcourse, Ajay Devgn. He plays the quite-in-words, loud-with-action Singham with a lot of energy. Prakash Raj plays the arrogant, ""egoistical"" Jaykant Shikre with a good dose of humor. The rest of the cast supports these two in whatever needs to be done to get the film through its 140 minute run-time.These characters, the lines given to them, the set-up they find themselves in all say, ""we are so cool that you can laugh at us, see if we care."" They play childish pranks with each other, they mock and mimic each other, they bring in popular film references in regular conversation. These are the things that make Singham a little more than a regular good cop-bad goon drama. The good is good and the bad is bad, and it more or less, remains so. The hero is so good, and the villain is so bad that you don't believe either of them but you still want to know how the good is going to get out of the soup that the evil has created. Anyway, maybe the gray shade had no business in films like this. Who wants the ""in-between"" when a corrupt politician needs to be beaten up?Singham does represent the frustration our nation is going through. We are desperate. We want solutions to our corrupt government. We are so darn aggravated that we want to suspend our disbelief and trust that if we all came together we can crack the long-overdue whip at the system. So, we cheer Singham as he goes about his job of being honest and brave. But Rohit Shetty doesn't want us to forget it's a film. He makes sure with his ""out-takes"" in the end credits. All this coolness is fake; it's for films. In real life, you can't do better than online petitions and candle light vigils. ]"
570,"[Have you noticed the rising background music that almost every rom-com plays in the climax? It's a predictable pattern - rising piano melodies and beats, a raging one-liner, which changes the course of the film, ""You had me at hello"" (Jerry McGuire) or ""It was magic"" (Sleepless in Seattle). Following which, the music stops, for the ground breaking 30 seconds of revelation. And then the pair kiss; over a slow sax playing in the background. Even though we love seeing our familiar faces - Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, and Richard Gere - do the romance ritual, we could each write a thesis on it.A Lot Like Love, too, is predictable, but only the kind that you like to relish on a love-starved day. It's a story of two stark opposites (predictability no. 1) Amanda Peet and Ashton Kutcher, who meet on a flight while still in college. Sparks fly, (no 2) but with one slight variation. Peet is looking for some airplane-washroom-action, while Kutcher seems love struck. They find excuses to keep in touch and this sparks off a series of meeting over 10 years. They grow up, but not with each other - and in each phase, they manage to run into each other. The fun bit of the film is that every chance meeting isn't predictable; the lead actors have a crackling chemistry and the soundtrack is extremely sensual, funny and passionate - very much in sync with the film. A Lot Like Loveis fresh, because it doesn't need to rely on stereotypes to reveal a growing bond between the lead pair. With each chance meeting, year after year, the chemistry/repressed emotions get more and more palpable. Much like the rising piano melodies that are intrinsic to a climax of a rom-com, A Lot Like Love's script (written by Colin Patrick Lynch) rises with every plot point, to a predictable climax, you want the movie to move in a pace where you can absorb every moment of growing passion.The DVD, released by Bueno Vista Home Entertainment, has a couple of negligible bonus features - an audio track by director Nigel Cole, deleted scenes and blooper reel that is very hilarious courtesy Ashton Kutcher and a music video of Aqualung's 'Brighter Than Sunshine', possibly the best song on the soundtrack.We all like to be intellectually stimulated, but there's a different joy in reaching out to a more expressive side within you, that likes the regular dose of mush. Unlike typical romantic movies, A Lot Like Love is a crisp, fresh and well-paced love story of two very lovable characters. It's A Lot Like Love, not all love. It's partly wit, partly humour and lots of smile-worthy moments!]"
571,"[I loved Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. I don't know if it will last long enough to become classic or cult (never understood those terms). But, I enjoyed every single moment that I spent in that theater. Yes, even though it was a full two-and-a-half-hour-long film. Three friends are off to Spain to close on a deal they made with each other years ago - each will choose an adventure that the three of them have to experience together. The characters are alive, the cast is lively, the writer is thoughtful and the movie is clean, soft, perceptive entertainment.There is nothing profound about Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara; neither does it bring any insight that you and I don't already have from our own relationships. But, it connects from the word go. Maybe, I connected with it instantly because some of the things are too close to home. I've spent a lovely week-long, road-trip in Spain. I've walked through the little towns on their narrow, stone-bricked lanes. I've lived in the quaint hotels with their lovely lobbies.  And the cinematographer brings all of this alive. Spain, what a beauty you are! Add to this nostalgic mood, a piece of adventure that the three friends are experiencing. Deep sea diving, my latest addition to the ""I love"" list. And sky-diving which I've wanted to do (with my mom, no less!) for the last 15 years. The third adventure, uh...well...that one I think I'll play the woman card and leave it at, ""I'm happy to enjoy it vicariously through Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar and Hrithik Roshan.""Also fast getting on the list of ""I love"" are these three men! And goodness, even Katrina Kaif. Abhay Deol is instantly endearing as the sorted-out, problem-free, likeable guy who runs a little above average on emotion for a man. Farhan Akhtar's Imran is aptly described as an a$$hole. He plays the perfect shallow-outside-deep-inside, observant poet who doubles up as the comic relief. If I had to pick a weak-link it'd be Hrithik Roshan, but I'd be nit-picking about how his acting falls flat in the second half. He, after all, did get me annoyed with his ""oblivious to my arrogance"" attitude. Usually, introductions bore me; they are too in the face. And climaxes, disappoint me. The better the build-up towards it, the worse the fall in the end. Very few films manage the climax that is Goldilock's ""just right"". Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara's set-up is so subtle, that you don't even realize that's what it is till the opening credits begin. And the climax is yep, ""just right""! A minute more after that would have been too much. Yeah-yeah-yeah, there I do have my mandatory reviewer's disclaimer ""There are couple of flawed moments."" But you know what, they pass by quickly, and the fun/sweet moments are many more.Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara like zindagi itself, is about mistakes. It's about closure and the importance of closures. Because only then can we move on. Only then, can we have that new beginnings, we so deserve. ""Life is a once-only gift. Live it to the fullest.""  The cliche was alien to our parents. And is becoming the mantra of our responsibility-free generation. And why not? New money is becoming easier to get and even easier to spend. Savings is a dated concept. Because who knows? You might live long enough to enjoy retirement. Reminder: We live in a world of tsunamis and bomb blasts. So, there is merit to ""live the moment""So, when are you planning your next vacation? Fine, fine, take your time. Meanwhile, book your tickets before the praise that I've just showered upon the film raises your expectations so high, that they will only fall. ]"
572,"[This weekend I attended a funeral. I cried, mourned the death and let myself sink into a grey hovering void. This weekend I saw the second part of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows. I pep talked myself into letting go; all that jazz about how life moves on and death is an eventual calamity much like the jack in the box - it's over before you know it. But it doesn't. Because this end is metaphorical. Almost the same line is used in every review of a Harry Potter movie - the book was better, and the film missed out on many crucial parts. But for those of you who have been following only the films, this movie is an all-encompassing, wrapped liked a sushi roll, crisp ending to a saga.Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows takes us through the last bits of Harry's journey as he finds parts of Voldemort's soul, also known as horcruxes and destroys them. The film picks out the best moments and twists it into a visual glamour. With threads of emotion, it thrills and walks us through many lives, many endings.It has the emotional tension: between what Dumbledore has left behind and Harry's doubts, between Snape's veiled demeanor and Harry's rage, between Harry's bravery and Voldermort's sinister fury. It is Harry's journey but the story of so many more people: Of the Weasley family, 3 friends from different backgrounds and their intertwining lives, the many professors that put a mark on every Hogwarts students' life and Snape - who's beyond levels of comprehension.The opening and closing shots of the film are grand, as if they are hints of what became and what is being left behind. Eduardo Serra's photography is distinct and symbolic with the feel that one gets while reading the book. It incorporates a tired, yet reassuring tone that allows you to live each moment of intense and passionate action. Alan Rickman as Snape and the trio - Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are majorly the reason for the lump in your throat. They manage to carry with them reminiscent performances of every film and mould them into an adventure ride that feel privileged to take with them. Each character, each loose end is tied into a knot; every sub-plot given its due ending - closure in all senses. This film, unlike the others which bore the pressure of matching up to the books, manages to leave a visual impact, and comes pretty close to the images you formed in your head. If only the climax were played out with a more growing pace. Although by the end of the film, you're almost on the edge because you know the end is nearing, you still want to put your time on the moment. The emotional connect is haunting and Alexander Despat's background score is like melodies flowing into sentences of drama, yet the end seems like a series of quick montages.Or maybe that's coming from an emotional viewer's perspective. I would never get up from my seat. I would sit there, living the entire world of witchcraft and wizardry in my head on loop - but I was forced to walk away. Watch the film so you can identify the message that the movie is trying to send to you -Beyond the magic, charm, tragedies and memories. When you walk out from this theatre, remember to feel special because you have been a part of the Harry Potter generation.]"
573,"[Love manifests itself in many ways; it's a visual and written cliche. All you need is perception and memories, and you can see the cliche unfold beautifully. In Chungking Express, the Wong-Kar Wai manifestation of love however, intoxicates you, makes you dance around in a circles of extremities - with crimson red passion on one side and navy blue, bordering grey loneliness on the other.Chungking Express is about love lost, the city life with all its colours, humanity and its feats - all while it slowly deconstructs every little thought bubble that pops in your head through the film. The film is divided into two stories, about 2 cops and their bitter experiences with love. Cop 223 is hung over his girlfriend, May who left him on April fool's day. He buys a can of pineapples with a month long expiry, hoping she'll be back before the expiry date. Cop 663 is also dealing with an intense breakup with his airhostess girlfriend. He starts to find routine comfort in a midnight cafe amidst a waitress called Faye, while she breaks into his apartment to cure her fascination for his passiveness. Nothing explicit is common between both the stories - they are accounts of two random cops in a fast-moving city. A city  that's not going to stop to cure broken hearts. The city incorporates colours, disconnected photography and pop-culture (the waitress is addicted to 'California Dreamin' by The Mamas and The Papas, a splash of blonde wigs and dark glasses and Dinah Washington played in the background of the second story)You won't see love spelt outright in the film, it's in the pace with which the parallel stories secretly interact, it's in the silence of the two protagonists and their kaleidoscopic experiences, and most of all it's in the visual treatment of the film. With many billboard signs and slogans, pop-music as background score, an amalgamation of realistic and romantic cinematography and conflicting colours, the movie makes you feel you're watching a Godard film, but before you can hold that thought - the visuals shift between film/video to pixilated images. The criterion collection DVD of Chungking Express comes with a commentary by British film-writer Tony Rayns - who offers a unique analysis of the film. It helps, because it might take you multiple viewing to realize that something is happening in the film. One watch down, all you remember are shots, colours and an intoxicated, jazzy hangover of the film. The kind that makes you want to rewind and re-watch scenes. The only other extra is a short excerpt (12 min.) from a 1996 episode of the BBC series ""Moving Pictures"" in which Wong and Christopher Doyle (cinematographer) discuss the shooting of 'Chungking Express' and then-upcoming film 'Fallen Angels'.In Chinese, the title of the film translates to Chungking Jungle - a metaphorical take on the concrete jungle of the city. A jungle where love doesn't get lost - it only comes back to you in ways you cannot comprehend; you might be able to - with multiple viewings of Chungking Express. Buy the DVD, you will be thanking me soon. ]"
574,"[Gone are the days when romantic comedies meant falling in love with a person who is the stark opposite of your personality - memorizing their dialogues, their looks and just living their lives with them. Before we knew it, When Harry Met Sally, Serendipity and Notting Hill is now No Strings Attached, What Happens in Vegas and the likes. Somewhere you wondered where the romance of everyday people in magical circumstances got replaced with quirky sex comedies where ""love"" became a dangerous drug you happen to sniff by the end of the film. The promos of Larry Crowne brought back the nostalgic feeling of the rom-coms of the 90s with a contemporary lime-twist. Tom Hanks is Larry Crowne, a popular middle-aged man working at U-mart and Julia Roberts is a teacher who's lost her passion for the profession. Crowne gets fired from his job because of his lack of college education and he meets his teacher, Mrs. Tainot, at the public-speaking class she takes.They're immediately cast as opposites. He's charming, cute in a middle-aged way and she's uptight and cynical - just like the good old days where one character made up for the lack of qualities in another. Predictably so, they take their time to warm up to each other. But once that's through, the background score, the dialogues everything gets lighter, the lead pair seems pleasant with the make-me-feel-alive kind of chemistry. Oh yes, Hanks and Roberts have chemistry, which is a breeze to see. But there's nothing beyond the chemistry. It's like the whole film circles around that once aspect, branching out every now and then to throw in some sub-plot. It's not a memorable film, the kind you wouldn't mind watching on TV while switching channels. It's an old-fashioned, character-driven love story, and even talks about contemporary issues like the economic crunch in the US, but you could walk out of the theatre feeling unaffected and forgetting why you went in, in the first place. More importantly, both lead characters seem to strike a friendship more than a fairytale romance. They seem like the kind who would have great conversations over coffee and a fireplace. The palpable chemistry is attributed to the well-written characters and good acting on Hanks and Roberts part, but a romance was unnecessary and just seemed forced. Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts are a marketable pair; it would have been a far more interesting film if it broke the stereotype of the compulsive need to make a lead pair fall in love. Otherwise, Larry Crowne is an average film, which you wouldn't feel for whether you watched it or not. Watch it only if you possess undying love for either Hanks or Roberts. ]"
575,"[It's unlikely that kids have a smartass nickname for every-single-body they know (including the apartment complex they live in). For sure, kids do not take on powerful politicians to do what they think is right. But neither do kids solve mysteries like the  Famous Five or the Secret Seven. Chillar Party is a story. It asks us to think what we have grown into, from the innocent, straightforward children we once were. Chillar Party doesn't preach, it keeps things simple and that's what worked for me, especially the climax. It hits you just the right amount. And it gets the right spot too. A bunch of kids from middle class families fall in love with a homeless child and his dog. The stage is set for one those regular, ""I'm so sorry for you, that I need to help you"" story (very similar to Zor Laga Ke Haiyya). Which translates to -  the stage is set for kids acting too old for their age, preaching to adults who are always wrong, etc. This, in turn, translates to a lot of yawning. But, Chillar Party begins to surprise you. The surprises begin with little things. For example, there is no overt sympathy towards a child because he is less fortunate. He earns the sympathy he deserves, one bit after another. And all of it through play.  The Chillar Party gets no instant success, it has its share of struggle. Children behave the way children are most likely to behave. Well, almost. Of course, it's difficult to accept that kids can start a revolution. But in these times of internet and candle-light vigils, can we be sure that kids can't do it? It doesn't really take that much to make it to the breaking news, does it? Parents scold, are unreasonable and considerate as parents usually are. The child-parent or even the parent-parent interactions flow naturally. Ever been to a society meeting? There is this particular moment in which you see how every dad is a hero for his child. But, you know the dad is in a situation, that adults invariably find themselves in, which will take him far away from being a hero. Sure, the things the Chillar Party tries to do are larger-than-life. But who knows what we were capable of when we were children. I know my kids (ages 7 and 9) understand concepts though they might know the words adults use to describe them. I know they come up with the most awesome ideas when they are NOT asked to (and are asked not to, too!). Girls from my building (ages 6-9) have formed a ""creativity club"" and their first activity was to make ID cards for its members. And rule +1 is ""boys not allowed!"" Chillar Party is adorable and cute. Both the film, the members of the gang, and the actors who make the gang work. The music is catchy and fun. Kids are going to have a ball while watching the film. And there's hope that adults will remember the film a little after they are out of the theater. Especially when they are reminded of the lessons taught in school. No, no, not the ones that are ""really"" useless. The life hacks, we teach our kids but forget to follow through on. The kids might feel sorry for a stray dog (Oh, for the record, I don't even like dogs!). But, we as adults know Chillar Party is about something much larger. Us. The world we have made our home. ]"
576,"[People who take pleasure in causing pain to others - there are loads of movies/TV shows based on such characters. The psychos might have an agenda, or they are just wired that way. Either way, for a seasoned, Dexter follower, brutal serial-killers are hardly a phenomenon. Then I blame the sex part of the sexual violence that managed to creep me out, regardless of however experienced I am in watching their trade. Murder 2 reaches out to the primal fear in the woman in me. It might be a copy of another film or a dozen of them, I know not. It might have a dozen loopholes, and boy it does! But none of that matters. Your brain recognizes those gaps when it's watching the film, but it is just about processing the other sensations the film is producing. It can't be bothered with story details and such. I could go on about ""how come he knows this?"" and ""why doesn't the police do that?"" But if my skin is crawling with fear of the villain from scene one till end, the film has worked. The film works only and only because of its villain. Now whether it is because of Prashant Narayanan or Pandey (the character he plays), I wouldn't know. They are so one with each other. After you are out of the theater, you might analyze that it's never clear if the serial killer is confused about his sexuality and/or is ashamed of it. You might also realize that the violence you just watched wasn't really sexual in nature, but that's the ambience the film creates. I wonder if they had made these things more specific, how much more trauma it would have caused to my nerves. Being a person who doesn't enjoy such ""thrill"", I could also bear it only because Pandey didn't fit into my concept of a serial killer. He isn't neat in his work and he isn't careful. But I guess, there are more TV shows and films about only meticulous murderers than about the ones that got caught. Murder 2 is different in that aspect too. We know who the murderer is and he gets caught pretty early in the film too. He's in police custody and we still fear him. Because of what we saw in the promos or because we are worried sick for the innocent young girl who's 2-minute backstory makes you feel sorry for her. It is not as much her backstory as it is Sulagna Panigrahi's performance that does that to you. Brilliant casting, that. Which reminds me of Jacqueline Fernandez. Hah! I think the Bhatt's are brilliant with their marketing. They know their USP, and why the audience is really here. They lose no time in making Jacqueline lose her clothes. And once that is done, they start with the actual story. And that's it. She doesn't have anything to do after the couple of steamy scenes. And Emraan Hashmi. Well he does have stuff to do after the said scenes, but like I said Prashant Narayanan completely chews the scenery.Did I enjoy the movie? Hell, no. It is not at all my type. Did it achieve its purpose? Yep! It kept me uneasy throughout. And for the kind of people who are thrilled by such kind of violence, it might work even better. Does all of this make it a good film? While you are watching it, yes. But in hindsight, you see all the places it went wrong and wonder how much better it could have been. Anyway, like I always say, that would have been a different film though. Ps. If you haven't figured it out yet, this one has nothing what-so-ever to do with the Murder.]"
577,"[As a child we're always told to not fear when in doubt - that a solution will always appear sooner or later. It made us seem that doubt was a horrible thing, lying there under our beds with the cookie monster, conniving and scheming to turn us into complex individuals. John Patrick Shanley's Doubt  celebrates that limbo feeling of neither-here-nor-there. It celebrates doubt, not in a conventional way but in a manner that makes you agree that every question needn't have an answer. Starring Meryl Streep, Philip Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis (all four received academy award nominations for their performances), Doubt is set in a Catholic school in 1964, at a time when the church was undergoing a reformation. Streep plays the principal Sister Aloysius, who is an authoritarian and a traditionalist. As a contrast to her, we have Reverend Flynn (HoffmanAmy AdamsThe conflict arises when Reverend Flynn is accused of abusing the first black child in the school. There is no evidence provided to prove either side - neither to Sister Aloysius, nor to us as an audience. Rev. Flynn is just shown to be kind and empathetic towards the boy who gets bullied because of his colour. We swim around in a circle of questions, much like the other characters in the film, who oscillate between many a Yes, No and Maybes. During the film, you forcibly try to deduce an answer, scrounging around for hints that point to a tentative explanation - because we all need those explanations, for us to feel sane and normal. The beauty of Doubt lies in its rejection of confirmations. The movie provides you with no answers, and let's you gnaw on an existential crisis through the film. The film's tone is somber, with slow plot movements, a calm yet eerie piano foiling the background score and emphasized performances by all the characters. Hoffman and Streep play staunch opposites and thus, the pressure to pick a side elevates.Doubthas what you would call powerhouse performances. You see the film through several points of views - Hoffman, who makes you believe he is innocent, Adams who makes you live the frustration of torn sides and Streep who is the reason behind your doubt. For all her firmness and staunch beliefs, her eyes always have the question mark. Viola Davis plays the child's nerve-wracked mother, who furthers your sense of doubt. Doubt was adapted from Shanley's play Doubt: The Parable - when you learn this fact you see how wonderful this subject matter would be as a play - with its scope for drama, tension and dense self-questioning. The DVD has a 19 min featurette titled 'From Stage To Screen' where Shanley talks about the adaptation. The DVD also has interviews with the Cast, an audio commentary of Shanley and a few extended scenes. Watch Doubt, so you can experience the joy of rejecting closure. The truth won't always mean closure, and closure isn't always the truthful end. In doubt, you can truly remain. ]"
578,"[It's scary when you've seen a fit and bordering-chubby actor in films like American Psychoand Nolan's BatmanSeries turn into a frail, 6'3 - 110 pounds man for a character. Apart from the sincerity and dedication, Christian Bale's look in The Machinistjust creeps you out. In the film, he plays a man who hasn't slept in a year and hence loses copious amounts of weight, and everytime you see his ribcage or protruding spine you just want to leap into the screen, feed him some food and sing him a lullaby to sleep. The Machinistis a thriller alright. Trevor Reznik works as a machinist, a fairly laborious job which should want him to have a good night's sleep. Yet his insomnia brings him to a nightmarish state, where he repeatedly has flashback visions, everything around him is woozy and uncontrollable. He believes a co-worker who doesn't exist is harassing him, he gets sucked into a warped game of hangman, which haunts him at several points, and he finds solace in 2 women with dual personalities - a sex-worker who becomes his confidante and a dedicated mother and a waitress, who allows him to escape his world through their conversations. Both women overlap each other, yet they stand apart bringing to the table different emotions for him to explore. The concoctions used in The Machinistare the standard ones. A troubled protagonist, undergoing physical and psychological trauma that leads to furthering of the plot, a dark, largely black/white tone of the film and an ascending Hitchcock-esque wailing piano background music. You know his lack of sleep is making Reznik see things, yet you want to know if someone is conspiring against him, as he believes. You will find yourself arguing that all of this could be a hallucination, but you don't want to seem presumptuous - hence you sit with your bitten nails waiting to see what finally happens. Although no ground-breaking secrets are revealed at the end of the film - it's actually a very typical climax for it's genre - you still make that journey as a viewer with the film where you feel like the story has met it's end. You know because Reznik has found his closure, you can sit back and feel the same. The Machinistis one of those few films where you get attached to character not because you particularly like him, or because you are sympathetic of him - it's just a brilliant job of characterization. You immediately feel drawn to his story.The DVD has an audio commentary from the director Brad Anderson, which helps deconstruct the film and is much better than having a rambling account of the shoot and set. The only problem is, he spoils the endings of films like Fight Club andThe Sixth Sense, so if you haven't seen those, skip the commentary. There are also a few deleted scenes and theatrical trailers in the special features section, which is intriguing - they reveal that the film is shot in Spain. Bale's look in the film would qualify as the creepiest aspect, among other things in the film. You'd be interested in knowing that 3 months after the shoot of this film, he shot for Batman Begins. The Machinistis out and out a Christian Bale film; it's about his character, his look and the creepy stuff that happens to you if you don't sleep. Take your mother's advice, go to sleep before someone makes a movie about your insomnia. ]"
579,"[First things first (oh how I hate the phrase but, how important it is), T  bhabhi, please don't read this, go and enjoy your film. That goes for all Big B lovers. I am one too, so I know how much we want to like Bbuddah Hoga tera baap.Reviewers like us will come and go, who want this, that and more in our films. But a persona like Amitabh Bachchan...Bbuddah Hoga tera baap is an attempt to pay a tribute to him. Because there can be no justifiable words after those three dots, the film is underwhelming. For example, the songs had caught on, and you knew AB Sr. is going to groove to them. I don't know what you are expecting, but something that will surpass his cool act in Jumma Chumma, maybe? That's not to say he doesn't look suave in white and orange, with a printed scarf. Or that his moves aren't as charming as they were, back then. But then, you see both, the writer/director's passion and devotion to the man whose films we grew up with. You see he's hurt, that his idol has been sidelined to roles that say, ""ol' man, you have passed your prime."" Even if they are age-appropriate. He wants to revive that charisma, maybe, one last time. That I respect.It's not like the film just showcases Amitabh Bachchan as  Amitabh Bachchan and has nothing more. Considering that the film is a blatant ""star-centric"" film, Bbuddah Hoga tera baap has a reasonably fleshed out story. The characters might not be very deeply thought out, but their motivations are clear. There are nuances that keep the film contemporary. Like the honesty about morals that were always deteriorated. He's not moralistic just because he's Amitabh BachchanBut alongside are the references/tributes to films from the 70s. The parents who hate love stories; the hero who continues to be a hero despite taking on 3-4 bullets on the chest; the gratuitous song; a girl who plays hard to get. Some of these things work, some don't. Raveena Tandon as comic relief is annoying beyond measure, for example. Then again, there are those simple things that give joy just because they aren't there. Unlike some producers we know, you don't have this one making his presence felt in a now-mandatory end credit ""item"" song. When the songs actually had enough potential to do the job. It's a film by him, for him and of him, after all.I liked Bbuddah Hoga tera baap because of Amitabh Bachcan. In a very vague way, I get Salmania. But I still use vague because, had it been an Ajooba or a Toofan, I'd have hated it. Thank you, Mr. Writer, for leaving in a story in there. But, I know you know, nothing can do justice to what Amitabh Bachchan symbolizes for at least three generations. Maybe it's time to tap how much more he's capable of. For your attempt, though, I applaud you, because I identify with your enthusiastic affection. So, here goes my attempt at a tribute. I could sit in one place and look at him, staring at a distance, humming 'Haal-e-dil' for an hour and a half and more. When he romanticizes Bombay, he combines two of my loves, and the delight it brings, makes me nostalgic about my affair with the city. When he flirts with girls less than half his age, he makes me cringe. Maybe because I see a baap in him. But soon enough, I forget that I'm seeing him, I see good ol' Viju charming his way - girls, women, police, villains, and all. Except, he can't reach out to the woman of his life. In that fleeting moment, his pain is evident, so are his arrogance, helplessness and resignation. When he kicks a villain's butt and 65+ year-old muscles move to some really complicated action choreography - without the help of a camera trick or an editor - I......oops, sorry, didn't mean to call him bbuddah! Can I get away with, ""Sir, I wanted to see more, much much more""]"
580,"[Delhi Belly picks its genre and sticks to it. It's as if a generation is standing up to say, ""Call us pulp or dark, crass or gross. This is how we are - take it or leave it."" He/she could be the common youth on the street, sitting beside you in a theater, a new age director or a producer gracing you with an appearance in the end credits. The three roommates are representatives of a young, urban India who are trying to break the shackles binding them to what was considered a ""normal"" life. They, along with their friends, are the latest breed of graduates - not necessarily from art, science or commerce - from alternate fields, like media and hospitality. And there is this other thing that happens to them - shit. They deal with it. By hook or by crook, they see their way through it. They are far from sophisticated, because they care a damn. In fact, they have no qualms about driving you to nausea. But they take care of themselves.  Recently we have seen a whole lot of films in this genre. Where a bunch of innocent people (mere bystanders, even) get into trouble unawares, and destiny somehow puts the puzzle of 3-5 parallel stories together. Delhi Belly has that skin but from within its unpretentious. It has no inhibitions whatsoever, be it toilet humor, obscenities, violence, vulgarity or sex. I loved its focus on making its audience laugh using their language. I most certainly missed a few jokes because loud laughter, from a previous line, didn't' die in time. Delhi Belly doesn't try to act smart by saying, ""Try, and figure me out if you can"" Or ""keep pace with me if you can"". Keeps it simple (please admire my restraint), it does. The flip side of course, is that the characters don't get too much attention. In keeping the story simple, the characters are one-dimensional. The performances though come to the characters' rescue. They are so brilliant that I didn't have to think about how one was acting or overacting or not. In fact, Vijay Raaz and his gang are caricatured and seem a little out-of-place and yet, they pass  by without causing irritation. Well, I guess it's because they are led by Vijay Raaz, after all. Well, a movie that can nail it all would've been a different movie, right? For example, how I wish they'd avoided a couple of extraneous sub-plots. Anyway, the way it is, there's so much going on in the background music, the props and the dialogue that it becomes a bit overwhelming. Delhi Belly makes no over-imposing statements, no grand messages. (That's a change from the typical Aamir Khan product.) It's just one young film. It was fun watching it with my favorite people - the 600+ filmaniacs who not only show up but also whistle and hoot at 8.15 AM. Let's just say like every dabangg has its audience, every Delhi Belly does too. And there must be a lucky bunch whose tastes include both. Ps. Oh yeah, I told you right? I'd recommend you keep your parents away from this one. That you liked Delhi Belly, by itself might be a bit of a cultural shock to them. Which also means if you are conservative in your taste in films, you should stay away. Confession: I goofed-up. I watched the English version. I have a feeling the real deal is in Hindi. I'll try to catch up with the Hindi version and update you on what works better. ]"
581,"[I love action films and I love the idea of machines transforming into other machines. Seriously, it's damn neat. It's not only the idea but also the slick way they've been transforming since Transformers (the first in the series). I like how the machines move and the sounds they make while they are at it. As sarcastic as it may sound (given the rating), I mean it. But more of the same? For all of two and a half hours? Naah. Don't make me hate something I love, by overdoing it. Actually, I had already had enough with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen . The monotony of the action sequence in the climax made me nod off for a good twenty minutes. I'm not proud of it, especially since I was accompanying a Transformer-enthusiast. Oh no, I didn't sleep during this one, I was going to review it, so I couldn't sleep. So, that's no credit to the film. For the non-action minutes in the film, which might be all of 20, there are a few good comic lines and a lot of mumbo-jumbo about freedom. There are good aliens vs. evil aliens. And how they cross and double-cross each other and humans. Which also means, the humans don't get much room to emote. They are scared and tense most, and they continue being that way through the rest of the film. I understand and, maybe, even have come to terms with the fact that action films - of course not all of them - cannot be bothered with a story. And with Transformers: Dark of the Moon I wasn't expecting one either. But the very least they could have done was get creative with the action and the 3D. Some of the ways in which one car turns into a mean machine and back, it looks like a mere cut-and-paste from either an earlier scene or another car, color-corrected. More action, I don't mind. More of the same - I have trouble spending time, energy and money on.]"
582,"[Every film studio in the current day and age is experiencing a domino effect. Ever since the first one, (bonus points for telling me which) decided it would be a cool idea to make a sequel of successful film - the idea has being flying from studio to director as if it were the most innovative thing since a nose trimmer. Cars 2  is no different than the fundamental process of wanting to double the success of an original film. The first film, Cars was a depictive story of an anthropomorphic world of cars, their races and their lives; Cars 2 follows from the same plot, where world champion Lighting McQueen (Owen Wilson) and his best friend tow-trunk Mater (Larry The Cable Guy) head to Europe and Japan to participate in the World Grand Prix. Meanwhile, Mater gets whirl-pooled into an international espionage.The movie is cute, you can't take that away, with all it's inside jokes about cars and a motor-ridden lifestyle. In this world, a car with open wheels is considered ""good looking"", and they've managed to incorporate the fuel versus electricity debate, which sucks you in - as a movie about cars could have the potential to alienate a few. There are a few sequences that are visually engaging and lot's of fun to watch, like the opening sequence which plays around with a Bond-like night-time raid on a ship. The background music is head-popping and fast-paced, and the crisp, tight-cutting animated shots make you sit back and go, ""okay this could be a fun two hours"". However, it might be Pixar's (the animation studio behind Toy Story, Wall- E and The Incredibles) reputation or just that fact that the original film Cars, was a surprisingly feel-good, intelligent film that set the bar high for the sequel, but both these factors work against the film. That's the biggest problem with sequels - fundamentally, all the laughs, the jokes, the plot points feel rehearsed and forced. So when you laugh at the few moments in the film, you feel cheated. Cheated by a beer-bellied man in a tux is sitting behind a high-rising chair in a swanky office in LA smirking at his latest commercial investment. And maybe you wouldn't want that image in your head while you're watching a feel-good animation film. Exactly at that point, the film starts to drop, as if there is some higher force governing the point at which the film gets predictable.A side note on the animation of the film - the features of every car are innovative and true to the car's character, whether it's the buck-teeth of Mater or the handsome open wheels of Francesco Bernaulli, Lightening McQueen's rival (voiced by John Turturro, and possibly the most entertaining character of the film). strong&gt;Cars 2  is a fun weekend watch for you to unwind and sit with a large tub of popcorn. That is if you can channel out the voice of your movie-watching conscience. The same conscience that is trying to break your acceptance of lazy, ""timepass"" watches, that try to determine your intellect. Cars 2  is a decent film, and after a long week, you could treat yourself to a light film - but maybe it's time to look at the larger picture, and much more stimulating alternatives to what you consider as treats.]"
583,"[Makers of such slapsticks suffer from a huge superiority complex. By such slapstick, I mean, the """"ball hits balls"" and again and again"" kind of ""comedy"". And the makers' arrogance is transparent. Obviously they are intelligent people. They have raised  finances for such a dumb product. And yet they have this condescending attitude towards their audience. Or maybe, having money and knowing what to do with it, requires two different types of intellect. Even so, we know for a fact that Arshad Warsi, Riteish Deshmukh, Jaaved Jaaferi AND Sanjay Dutt are capable of so much more. Heck, even Ashish Chaudhury can do a better job with overacting than this. And yet, they chose this film. They couldn't be that out-of-work, could they? Miss Cleavage-Kangna-Cleavage-Ranaut-Cleavage and Mallika Sherawat did a better job than any of the guys, imagine that! Well, then again, that's only relative.The thing is the film has a plot that had huge potential to be funny. Four good-for-nothings trying to out-smart a smart aleck ex-cop. But if you are not going to get the least bit creative about your characters, how am I supposed to get interested? Save Maanav (Jaaved Jaaferi), the other three good-for-nothings have no distinguishing characters. They all can mimick, they can all role-play, they can all pull-off a disguise. Even though the disguises were well done and could actually conceal identity, the changed identities remained pretty much the same. Why have three different characters? Oh, too much money and we know not what to do with it, I forgot.If they didn't feel the need to work on a plot or characters, the least they should've tried is get a laugh or two out of us, right? Whole eggs crack in the mouth, and a guy chews on his boxer's naada (the string that holds the boxer shorts up) - they make me squeeze my eyes close and I can taste the disgust. In that sense then, I could feel what the characters felt. SighNeither do the umpteen references to other films or actors from the industry reach out to my funny bone. There is this slight comment the makers want to make about the babas (spiritual gurus) are no better or worse than goons from the underworld. But, the whole sub-episode is so loud that you couldn't bother yourself with subtext. On the other hand, the film does try to laugh at itself. There's a comment about the foursome, ""they look like crooks"" That is true. All four of them look straight out of the goon-factory - shady and repulsive. Then there are these two scenes where Sanjay Dutt makes a ""I don't have patience for this anymore"" expression, mimicking what's running through the audience's minds at those exact points. Yet you cannot forgive them for taking you for a fool.Another film that takes the audience for granted. Another one that would make the lousy sms forwards more interesting than the supposed smart-quips. Another one for you to skip and so you can enjoy the monsoons.]"
584,"[If you check your inbox from the early 2000s, you would definitely find one of those cheesy, forwarded emails that gives you a pictorial list of the most precious things on earth. You know, the smell of rain, the dewdrop on a rose and yes ofcourse, a child's innocence. Before you cringe at the thought of it, you should know that Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami's Where is The Friend's Home will break that cringe and make you fall in love with the concept of innocence all over again.Where is The Friend's Home  is set in rural Iran, and tells us a simple story of a small boy who travels all the way to another village to return his friend's notebook. We are introduced to the atrocities of small-town education that relies on it's strict discipline, sort reminiscent of Truffaut's 400 Blows. We walk through our protagonist Ahmed's life, to find that at the end of a hard day at school, he happened to bring his friend's notebook home. Well aware of the consequences of not finishing your homework in your notebook, Ahmed decides to visit the neighbouring village to return his notebook. Only, he doesn't know the way. But that doesn't stop Ahmed; his empathy towards his friends pulls him beyond selfish logic and we follow him on his journey to the neighbouring village. The picture of Where is The Friend's Home is stunning, in a simplistic way. While we follow Ahmed, we walk with him through unknown zig-zag roads, amidst the rural landscape of Iran. Much like most Iranian films, we venture on a poetic, visual journey coupled with a middle-eastern stringed background score and a slow-paced rhythmic movement towards the friend's home. By the end of the journey, you feel you know Ahmed much more than his parents of the elders, like you and Ahmed share a secret bond, of the pleasures of expedition you got to accompany him on. So much so, that the 83 minutes whiz by even though most of the film is shot on real time. Ahmed and the elders in a village have the conventional conflict in their ideologies. We see a more experimental, innocent yet observant viewpoint of Ahmed juxtaposed with the traditional values of his mother or his grandfather. But you don't have to make a choice. You're never made to leave Ahmed's side. The DVD of Where is The Friend's Home has no special features but it comes in a pack of three - The Koker Trilogy, which also includes And Life Goes On and Through The Olive Trees. All three are based in the village Koker, and surround the same characters. Yet with Where is The Friend's Home you won't feel like you watched a film. You'll have transported yourself on Ahmed's shoulder for 83 mins, walking and contemplating and absorbing every bit of his experience. I would ask you to explore the child-like innocence in you with this film, or realize the beauty of a simple story but as the cliche goes, the film offers you much more. It's like you've been made to close your eyes and visualize a story being played out as a young Iranian boy narrates it to you. How you chose to visualize Where is The Friend's Home becomes your viewing experience of the film. It's really that beautifully simple. ]"
585,"[Late teens. Most of us are old enough to get nostalgic about them. We had a tough time. We obeyed. We rebelled. Always Kabhi Kabhi picks four of us and tells our story. Or rather tries to. Because, for our stories to make it to films, they need to be exaggerated. And the hyperbole goes wary because it makes the same mistake our parents made or we as parents might make. Nag, rant, berate. The set-up, the problems chosen, the build-up weren't bad at all. From the over-attentive, selfish parent to the perennially disappointed dad to the missing-in-action socialite-parents - they have it all covered. But the second half takes you into a drastic overdo of either silly lover's tiffs or situations that are beyond unreasonable. To top it off, we have lame dialogue and amateurish delivery. I liked Zoa Morani the best. She was the only one who carried off the attitude assigned to her - ""whatever"".  The two boys, Ali Fazal and Satyajeet Dubey are just about tolerable. Though it might be my intolerance of chocolate-boy-looks and pretentious cuteness coming through here. Same goes for Giselle Monteiro. But at least her character came across as believable. The lasting impact though is of only ""blah"". It doesn't remain the chick-flick it starts out as, nor does it execute the message it wants to put across well. A similar point was much, much better executed in F.A.L.T.U. That each of us has a right to our own dreams. That just because one generation liked Shakespeare, doesn't mean generations and generations later he still has to be played out in the same vein. But what a ridiculous cop-out they chose to go with!?Maybe all of this would have worked if they showed, and didn't tell. And then just for good measure, have King Khan spell it out to us again in the end credits. I guess, we should thank him and our stars, that he didn't show up as one of the 18-year olds.]"
586,"[Anyone going in expecting a Bheja Fry - Part 2 will be disappointed. Anyone going in expecting laugh-out-loud comedy will be disappointed. The only people who have any hope of being satisfied are the Vinay Pathak believers. That too, is more of the same. But we'll make do since we've paid for the ticket. This is a serious case of give him too much money, and your disciplined child will become a spoilt brat. You have your aerial shots and cruise ships and remote island locales. It's cool, it's great even. But just for the sake of creating a situation which sounded great in your head? Especially the regional jokes were the least funny of them all! I don't know if it's a boon that Vinay Pathak is around to save the film or a curse that he spent time on it. Kay Kay Menon would have sleep walked through Bheja Fry 2 in his amateur days (if there is anything  like that for him, that is.) Amongst the rest you have Minissha Lamba in the first half and Amole Gupte in the second. She is clueless and he is loud, deafeningly loud. Amole Gupte's character is equally out of place too. In fact, everything in the second half just goes over-the-top. It becomes like a Tom and Jerry show, waiting to become funny. Or just getting stuck in admiring the brilliant simpleton vs. snotty idea that they had in the first film, and not knowing how to milk it further. Dear Mr. Ballary, if I want to see a senseless, plotless film that wants to make me laugh and fails miserably. I have my guaranteed avenues. I don't want precious money reserved for smaller films spent on that kind of tripe. New tripe, I'm ready for.  But the same thing over, na-ah.It hurts, you know? I mean, it's fantabulous and all that jazz when independent filmmakers get more money to make their films after a good first show. It's even better to have a Vinay Pathak on screen. Heaven knows how much I love seeing him over a moustache that is the only muscle moving on an actor's face. Or a dimple. But it hurts, and you know not how, when a Ready makes me laugh a little more than a Vinay Pathak-Kay Kay Menon film.]"
587,"[There are two kinds of predictability - the enjoyable-guesses kind and the don't-need-to-hold-your-breath-what's-the-point-anyway kind. The former can be applied to thrillers where you know the killer's going to be the unsuspecting face around the protagonist but with enough background music, you'll still be shocked off your socks during the climax. The latter is the worst kind - and Green Lantern, the newest superhero film adaptation, is presumptuously predictable. Based on the famous DC comic series, Green Lantern is about a group of saviors and chosen ones with the responsibility to save the universe. The Green Lantern Corps defeated the fearful antithesis, Parallax, many years ago and imprisoned him in an abandoned sector. He escapes, to create havoc among the universe when the strongest of all Green Lanterns, Abin Sur vows to choose his worthy successor from Planet Earth. Enter Hal Jordon (Ryan Renolds) and does he save the day? Take a wild guess. It's a majestic set-up; one that requires you to have read the comic before watching the film, but one of the biggest problems with Green Lantern is that it doesn't spend time trying to explain the backdrop to the uninitiated. By this, almost half the audience sitting in the theatre hall felt isolated. The movie waltzed in as a Matrix-cum-Captain Planet hangover and, until the end credits, remains just that. Those who have read the comics might feel differently, but any adaptation must at least spend a good amount of screen time establishing the characters and relevant contexts. Green Lantern is stylish, but nothing you haven't seen before. The graphics are slick, Ryan Renolds looks quite super-hero like in the film, but it's the yawn- inducing predictability of the story that makes the whole experience a dull one. You could walk out for some popcorn and walk back to have not missed much. And that's an anecdote attached to prime time soap operas. Director Micheal Campbell's Casino Royale was much more stylish, slicker and engaging. While watching the film you'll wonder how he shifted from a fast-paced, drool-worthy Bond film to a commercial, stereotypical Green Lantern. In Green Lantern, you will find that you can't relate to the protagonist, no matter how good he looks. The staple characters -the girlfriend, the sidekick and the bad guy from within - are all stereotypes, waiting to be overpowered by our protagonist but you don't feel grand at his victory or frightened at the possible downfall of the world.  There are a few funny dialogues, some scenes that will make you wide-eyed but there are only so many flying objects you can take through your dim 3D glasses before a splitting headache. Green Lantern is not a bad film; it's just not as challenging or inspiring as a super hero film should be. You would be better off buying the video game, because the film doesn't look or emote any differently. Even better? Wait for it to premiere on Cartoon Network on a Sunday afternoon. ]"
588,"[If there is only evil within you, there is nothing for you to struggle against. If you have no dilemmas, no internal conquests to make, you don't make interesting characters. If your characters don't interest me, I'm an audience tapping my feet, waiting for something unpredictable to happen. If you don't make anything unpredictable happen, I can only be awed so much by your slick cinematography, smart editing and pulsing background music. The point is there's an attempt to make the same point about our degenerating youth, in a different way. But style gets more than its share, and the dry runs of trying to shock, fail.And yet just the performances make this film worth a watch. It makes you sit up and take notice. All of them from a short role by Raj Kumar Yadav to the main characters played by Shiv Pandit, Gulshan Devaiya, Kirti Kulhari, Neil Bhoopalam, and of course Rajeev Khandelwal. We always knew Kalki Koechlincan play the doped out, girl-woman. Here you see another facet. The one with perfect comic timing. Sure, she has some awesome one-liners. And her character has a sense of humor darker than mine (yes, I have an inflated opinion about my dark sense of humor). Kalki takes being an insensitive bitch to the next level.And that's the best the writers do. The odd one-liner. Where's the depth that will engross you in the characters? The twists that will make you sit on the edge? There's a quip in my native language, marwadi, which translates to - Don't you trust your fate/luck? Usually used when someone's eating as if there's no tomorrow. Looks like director, Bejoy Nambiar doesn't trust his fate. Which is why he put in everything he thought is quirky in this one film - whether it belonged or not0. Lest he didn't get another chance. One example, Amy's (Kalki) excuse for being cold is shown to us in a fairy-tale like atmosphere. That just doesn't fit in with the otherwise morbid story-telling. Maybe this was just wrong judgment. Everyone is allowed a few of those.But there are more such examples. Dark characters find themselves in a spot that couldn't possibly get tighter. At this point, Bejoy breaks the fourth wall, has a character talk to the camera and have text superimposed on the screen!? Totally rocks the boat you've settled yourself in. Maybe, just maybe, this was intentional. Maybe the characters have lost their marbles and can't think straight anymore. Maybe, the youth that Bejoy seems to be commenting on is so beyond redemption that they can only find comedy in the great tragedy they have created. I'd have given that benefit of doubt if the rest of the writing supported it. Can killing someone by accident make you callous enough to kill at will?Without a doubt, the situation that Khoya Khoya Chand is set to is brilliantly edited. And for once I liked the use of slow motion in a song (ahem!). Yet, it looked more like a part of Bejoy's showreel rather than his Shaitan.Yes, each one of us has a devil that has made us its home. Yes, we need to fight it constantly to make this world livable. Yes, it's a beautiful concept that needs to be explored in Hindi cinema. Yes, it remains so.]"
589,"[""Life is a game of chess"" - That statement is neither new nor profound. Yet, Bhindi Bazaar Inc's makers are so impressed with the analogy that they made a movie out of it. And took every move literally. It's parallel between the chess game and the story of the film is fun to start with but it gets tiring very soon. The entire movie feels like one long exposition, where characters are still being introduced. It could be because of the over-dramatization or the slo-mo sequences, it seems like you are still seeing new stuff - new people, new situations within the film. When, in fact, you aren't. Also, the way the film unfolds, you are like, ""ok, you introduced me to the characters, let the real story begin."" This is largely because the ""real"" story is all in flashback. In fact, the present is just teasing you. Constantly.It also feels like a teaser because Kay Kay Menon is just sitting there, you can just about call his role an elongated special appearance. Similarly, there is nothing challenging about what Piyush Mishra or Prashant Narayanan have to do either. The only sore thumb sticking out is the new kid on block Gautham . He just doesn't match up to any of the talent he is surrounded by.Deepti Naval represents the condition of the suppressed woman in the underworld with calm and composure. Just like Shilpa Shukla expresses the growing role of women in crime with aggression. Vedita Singh gets to play the slutty b!tch, and she makes most of the opportunity. The conclusion being the cast was capable; they are just offered run-of-the-mill material to work with. It is possible that we have grown up since the days of Satya and Is Raat Ki Subah Nahi and we are better exposed to cinema from around the world. Maybe, if we weren't Bhindi Bazaar Inc would have worked a better.It's not as if they didn't give the plot a thorough think through and just patched stuff together as it came in. The attempts to dot the 'I's are clean and clear. But all of it is done over and over again - the overall story for sure. And the details are filled in with filthy language and crass dialogue - all of which is appropriate given the setting, all of which also doesn't shock any more.I can't help but feel a tad disappointed. It's not like I walked in with great expectations. It's just that I thought I'd be coming out with some mind-blowing performances that I'd remember for a long time to come.]"
590,"[Have you ever wondered what America considered as entertainment before  Keeping up with the Kadarshians? Because ""American"" has become an adjective, let's try describing a prototype - the many Paris Hiltons? Rock n Roll (with sex and drugs as backing vocals) or the highway diners, each promising the best steak you've ever had, where you're being served by a single mom, during her day job? Still so, ""American culture"" is a beaten up phrase, being manifested in way too many ways - some desire it, run after it and some make movies about it. Nashville, The Godfather and Citizen Kane come to mind when we think of quintessentially American movies - either incorporating the American way of life, or discussing political/social changes. Linklater's 1993 cult film Dazed and Confused doesn't take on that responsibility - and yet in it's easy going demeanor it ends up revealing much about America in the 70s.Dazed and Confused is mostly a nostalgic trip, centering around a few teenagers on their last day of school. It has no structure, no plot, no conflict/resolution but it creates a world, which will allow you - sitting in your Monsoon-ridden state in India - to be a part of the 70s in America. These kids, played by now very much older actors (Matthew McConaughey, Jason London, Rory Cochran, Adam Goldberg, Milla Jovovich, Michelle Burke), are rebels in the purest meaning known to them back then. They smoke marijuana like it's their justification for an adolescent confusion; they dress in a hippie-like rejection of anything authoritarian or capitalist and they listen to music with relevantly guised lyrics wrapped in an edgy electric-guitar consciousness. The movie sifts through scenes and sequences where the regulatory high-school behaviour is depicted - with intensive ragging, sexual and political casualness, and follows the students on their last day as a student. They go through their cannabis-induced grind of easy camaraderie and guilty pleasures - something common for their age. Each teenager's life is graphed, little by little, as the movie parallels between their individual stories and their relationships with each other. At some point, as a viewer, you are going to wonder, ""what next?"" but that's healthy. Dazed and Confused could also be a rejection of anything structuralist, including your idea that the movie should have something concrete. It might not make up for the lack of flow in the film, but because the movie aptly depicts a decade of American culture that is viewed so nostalgically, the rest is forgiven.The 2-disc Criterion edition of Dazed and Confused  contains audition tapes, several deleted scenes, behind-the scenes-footage, interviews and Kahane Corn's one-hour documentary of the ten-year-reunion of the film's cast and crew. The special features provide ample insight to us initiated viewers about why and how this film gained cult status in the US, over the years.This entire journey started when I found out Dazed and Confused was on Tarantino's list of Top 20 films. When you read the synopsis, you wonder how this film made it to a list that includes films like Battle Royale and Memories of Murder. It can be best explained by McConaughey's dialogue from the film, ""That's what I like about these high school girls; I get older, they stay the same age. Yes they do. Yes they do."" ]"
591,"[It's raining sequels this season; you should buy an additional umbrella that can hold that burden. It's not new to love an original and to have a sequel forced down your throat. Ayub Khan-Din scripted East is Easy in 1999 was one of the first British-Asian films to open the possibilities of that amusing premise - an Indian family living in the west and more such idiosyncrasies. The kids of the Khan family have it worse. Their mom is English and dad is a Pakistani patriarch. After a successful run, the movie opened up a good avenue for West is West  - which had some promising promos.West is West  is like a hangover, no pun intended. It's formulaic, and predictable. In West is West, Om Puri brings his youngest son, Sajid (Aqib Khan) to Pakistan because he feels he needs to inculcate some Pakistani culture into him. He deports him to his First wife's home in a village in Pakistan where he hopes that Sajid will learn some values and morals. It all turns upside down when his holiday turns into a nostalgic overstay and Sajid begins to settle as a village boy. Barring a few scenes here and there, the movie drags and the latter half becomes preachy and boring. Om Puri has a comic charm, which lasts for about 45 mins of the film after which you can almost foresee every event play out. The scenes that are funny, stand alone - jibes at the multiple relations in a Muslim household, lifestyle shifts between England and Pakistan, all make for hilarious 5-minute scenes. You could watch them on youtube over and over and be amused, but added to a film and it gets lost in the whirlpool. Quick note about the soundtrack of the film - the Sufi sound will make you feel like you're listening to Coke Studio, coupled with a few scenes that describe the serenity of Sufi music only to be best experienced in this side of the world. It's a well-executed vision, provided a peaceful respite to the otherwise confused commotion of the film. Director Andy De-Emmony isn't looking to expose to his audience to the harsh realities of British Muslims - it's not a deep film. You can laugh, and light-heartedly pull through 2 hours and walk out feeling amused but it gets stuck somewhere between a drama and a comedy. To top it all, West is West is also sprinkled with a few run-of-the-mill Asian, cultural stereotypes. It's a film that has a confused target audience and confused genre - and a cinematic confusion is not the same as a confused identity that stands on its own as a fundamental for culturally mixed films. If anything, West is West  gives a preachy and only brief account of the theme that is quite rich for any Brit-Asian comedy: an identity crisis.The characters are strong, be it English wife Ella (Linda Bassett) Sajid's mother, George Khan (Om Puri) or even Ila Arun as Puri's first wife - but together they only make for a passable watch. West is West  is not a bad film, it's enjoyable for a lazy watch, but I would recommend the much funnier and sharper prequel East is East. It serves the same purpose better if you're looking for a lazy watch. ]"
592,"[What kind of juvenile writing is this? Boy meets girl after he is engaged to her. They don't want to get married to each other. They play games so that the families go against the marriage. And then, guess what? They want to get married! And no I'm not giving the movie away. There's more in the story. How I wish there was more ""to"" the story too. It's one of those cases in which even the characters' motivations are explained, you can't be made to care, because everything is just so outrageous. I mean, how can you take any film that has this scene seriously - there is ominous music when a girl tells her ex she didn't call him when there was a stressful event in her life because she had deleted his number from her mobile! And the accompanying dialogue is atrocious too. The performances are just about passable. The makeup is awful. The camerawork is basic and purely functional. The music is .. whatever...Oh well, the entire film has a more or less regressive ""whatever"" feel to it. Who are these films made for? Do such films have any takers? Really?]"
593,"[In a way, watching a movie falls under a voyeuristic activity. You break into a fictitious character's life/head and watch them as they unfold as per their logic and then pass your opinion on how the events play out. This experience is not different from Nolan's first semi-feature length film Following. Released before Memento, Following has the same amount of genius as any of his other films, yet for some reason remains rare. Maybe in that lies the charm of the film. The movie surrounds Bill (Jeremy Theobald) who is obsessed with following people but never really interacts with them. He meets Cobb (Alex Haw) who not only follows people but also breaks into their homes and tries to understand their personal lives. It's a familiar labyrinthine structure, but not a predictable one. While following Cobb around, Bill meets a fascinating woman (Lucy Russel) and through intercutting, non-linear narratives and flashbacks you'll be left with only guesses and calculations about the climax of the film. The calculations are not like mental math though - it'll be like a stimulating lavender bath where your mind will spurn out conclusions and permutations automatically, and your body will be transported into the head of the lead character before you even realize it. If you loved Memento, The Prestige or Inception, Following has a similar pattern but it's so strong in it's premise and treatment it only reminds you in bits that you're watching a Nolan film. He's used a typical non-linear structure, his protagonist is edgy and the background score is hauntingly merging but every now and then you feel you've slipped back in time, into a Noir crime film with low-key/split lighting and ruptured camera movements. In all this confusion, Following lets you sit back and enjoy the fall of time, genre and logic. The film was shot on almost a negligible budget, so when you pick the DVD without any special features you're curious to know how it was managed. It could have been even more interesting to have a featurette or even an interview with Nolan about his vision of the film culminated into Following.Following is like a rugged, black and white poster that has come to life for 70 mins. It stuns you, in a post-modern way and leaves you confused. You can't just watch it. You'll have to become a stalker, and compulsively follow the visuals. The movie demands it. ]"
594,"[They are creating a world so imaginary, that they can do whatever they want with it. Yet, in the world they create, they stick to some laws, even if they've established those rules themselves. So, here they create mutants, deformed people, but their deformity only makes them more powerful and thus more scary. It's when they break their own rules or deviate from them, that they distract us from what they are trying to do or say. Whether it is the special effects, the moral dilemma, or the mirror they hold to us as a society. X-Men: First Class successfully avoids such digressions and has a gripping story to tell. My issues with the X-men series has mainly been (even X-Men and X-Men 2 and more so in The Last Stand and Wolverine) - this deviation. Mutant-powers being redefined as per convenience. Like say, all mutants suddenly developing an exaggerated sixth sense. The beauty of the concept was that what one mutant can do, the other cannot. It is annoying then, when Wolverine can start hearing/smelling/sensing stuff he cannot see, just because it moves the script along. The other complaint I have had is that the characters were too black and white. That and the lame one-liners - those were the two things that made me really skeptical about a FIFTH film in the series. Fortunately X-Men: First Class consumes you. There's so much going on in terms of mind games and special effects that you have already pardoned the absence of attempts to act. That and it has witty dialogue and some of the pauses are brilliant entertainment. So yes, you fear Shaw, you empathize with Magneto, you feel for Mystique and you wish Prof. X could give his head a rest from his finger. But that's more about the characters and how they've developed over the last decade for you. And has barely anything to do with the performances. Interestingly (assuming that you've seen the earlier films in the series), you know how the main characters in the film are going to end up. But, there's enough going on to make you wonder and wait for ""how"". As usual, the set-up is to display what our mutants are capable of and it is all building up to a humungous showdown. Given the cool things that our newly introduced mutants are capable, I felt a little letdown by the climax. As if some one ran out of $-power. Or rather the money was all consumed by the thumping, loud background music. Even so, it is nice to see Xavier, the sacrosanct, use his power to flirt. It is a welcome surprise to see Magneto's human side or Mystique's feminine one. Their dilemmas are only mutant. But their prejudices are human. The ""bad"" mutants are racists. The ""good"" mutants patronize humans in the evolutionary process, like we in real life want to keep tigers from going extinct.The sides they have to choose between mirror what real life is all about. The communist/capitalist divide or the fight between races or even religions. Yep, there is a token religious symbolism thrown in too. This is the kind of deviation that is unnecessary and makes the film that is going well look over-ambitious and even wannabe. But, the point is this - at the end of 2-odd hours, I came out a satisfied, thriller-action-junky customer. And this is despite wanting a little more in terms of super-power display. X-Men: First Class is just one of those places where the whole adds up to more than a sum of the parts.Warning: Some scenes were obviously censored (I saw it in Pune, India) - either beeped words or scenes cut out.]"
595,"[In a Shakespearean comedy, the pudgy, underdog klutz would usually be the character description of the hero's sidekick - but with the Kung Fu Panda Series, Jack Black as Po, the Panda, redefines the term ""hero"". If the first film made us believe with strong doses of faith, that anybody could be a hero and accomplish the un-accomplishable, Kung Fu Panda 2 does a fine job of showing us how it is to live up to the reputation. This time around, the introductions are done. We are well versed with the characters, Po the endearingly overweight Panda, the Furious Five - Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Monkey (Jackie Chan) Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross), their inter-personal relationships and how the uncanny situation of a Panda being the Dragon Warrior came about to be. While the first movie was about Po's training and redemption, this time around Po's nemesis Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) is sly and sinister, as opposed to the magnanimously dangerous Tai Lung of the first movie. We see Po venture into his past, to seek his identity while trying to destroy the enemy of the country.Po's victory becomes sweeter for the audience because it's that much more satisfying to beat a creepy villain. We know how it's going to end, but Po's clumsy idiosyncrasies pull you through a laughter-ridden hour and a half, as Po proves himself to be an entertaining yet worthy Dragon Warrior.A must-mention is the intricate 3D animation - even as a layman you can tell the details are remarkable and as imaginative as it gets. The expressions and voiceovers blend almost perfectly while absorbing you into their world of honour, colour and humour.Although the sequel allows Po to be a savior, and a convincing one at that - this time around his goofy instances are cut short and much time is devoted to funny dialogues. He's still the same old Dumpling-loving, bouncy Panda. What I love is that the success has not gotten to his head, but the sense of him being an underdog has considerably reduced. This makes the plot slightly predictable, as Po has the same eureka moments as the first installment; the humour is on the same level with just a shift in the story. However, the ultimate moral self-belief and hidden power manifests into 90 minutes well spent. It's undoubtedly charming and funny, just not funnier and more charming than the first movie. You could watch both movies back to back and think of it as one long film. That stands as a victory for Kung Fu Panda 2, in a world where sequels and 3D movies are clouding pretty much every aspect of a film. If you are confused about whether to go watch the film, don't be. You will have fun; you will remember why you loved Kung Fu Panda and you will find the idea of a sequel seems exciting.  Even so, Baby Po is so adorably animated in Po's flashback, you'll want to freeze the frame and just cuddle him to sleep. Baby Po is adorable, bouncy, funny and his eyes speak of an upcoming legend. Much like the film. ]"
596,"[I am in a state of shock. Ready actually has a sort-a, kind-a coherent story. Well of course, I'm using the word coherent loosely. And story. And what-the-hell, ""sort-a, kind-a"" too. What I'm trying to get at is, Ready has focus. Or more focus than the director's last outing and the actor's last outing. Put together, of course. I'm not joking or being sarcastic when I say, I found some of the one-liners and movie references in Readyquite witty. I talk defensively because of my general contempt for ""mindless entertainers"". So, you have your standard ""boy hates girl and yet wants to save her from the big, bad world"" routine. Boy is Prem (surprise!) who can get away with anything and is played by your standard Salman Khan doing a ""I can get away with anything, take that, you reviewers!"" I actually saw one one-liner in which I smiled and thought, ""wow! Comic timing and all, huh?"" I don't get phrases like ""paisa vasool"" and ""time-pass"". And surely I know nothing about what works for Salman fans. For example, Sakshi (one of the two Salmaniacs I know)  tweeted  - Okay so the first half isn't all that great or anything. and2nd half zillion times better.And I thought post interval, the film became more of the same from Anees Bazmee's world (along with its distasteful sproduction values). Till then, stuff was in the believable range. Like, you could see why Prem liked Sanjana and vice versa. Such logic is totally unheard of in this genre. Also, what makes Ready a shade different from other Salman films is that the other characters in the film had something to do. They are a tad more than props that work towards establishing how cool Salman is. For example, Mohan Joshi has a few amusing quips. Though the mockery that Paresh Rawal makes of himself is pretty much the same. Asin looks barely presentable. What went wrong, make-up dada?Another thing that happened here is that there was an attempt at passing on a social message. The irony of the social message was beyond hilarious. A husband realizes he's oppressing his wife, so he gives the woman ""permission"" to eat before him!?! But, you know as well as I do, no amount of ""different"" within the confines of what Anees Bazmee  can make is enough to make a film that I can whole-heartedly recommend. And, you know as well as I do, a Salman Khan fan cares two hoots for what I recommend or not. Go along and watch the next ""creative"" way in which his shirt comes off!]"
597,"[An educated, bored housewife homemaker is taken for granted. Not a very unfamiliar situation. You feel bad for her. You want her to reach out and do something exciting for herself. Can a day in her life actually make an interesting film, even if it is an unusual one? Not really. Especially when it's done in a mostly, disjointed way.One way to enjoy most films, or at least give them a fair chance, is to give in to the writer's leap of logic. I mean there is no way you can even begin to understand the basic premise of Kucch Luv Jaisaa if you cannot accept that a middle-aged, supposedly-smart woman would strike a conversation with a stranger at a coffee shop and ask to spend a day with him. So, accept we shall. But within the confines of those logical aberrations, there should be some rules, right? The weird just keeps getting weirder. And Kucch Luv Jaisaa is almost as boring as a woman-going-through-mid-life-crisis' life. Some endearing observations - minor and larger, societal, topical ones - and awesome performances by the lead pair that keep it from being a satisfying snooze experience. I have loved Sheffali Chayya Shah, ever since her Banegi Apni Baat days. She has a screen presence that very few character actors can boast of. And she carries that off in Kucch Luv Jaisaa too. Rahul Bose is her glum, introvert and perceptive companion. If only their characters had better motivations or even their motivations had better details, the film would have been enjoyable. Let us assume, the aim of the film is not to engage us in the aims and objectives of their lives. In that case, at least what they observed about each other needed something stronger, anything to involve us that one bit more. And what was with getting issues like ""how to talk to your teenage daughter"" doing in the middle of all this? Or rather in the end of all this? To show the stuck-at-home woman is after all ""cool""?You pick a dull housewife, you pick a gangster. Chalk and cheese spend a day together, we get that. You try to tell us that it's not fun to be either. Maybe they need to find an in-between and that's where they'll find peace and happiness. Yeah, right? Sounds like a quotable quote - you read, you smirk and you move on. ]"
598,"[Just-about-the-right shade of big yellow typeface, familiar names like Sally Menke and Eli Roth, background music that injects a combination of exhilaration and pumped-up-ness - all, ironically, contribute to a comfortable few minutes of the opening credits of a Tarantino film. You know what you're in for, with smart, uninhibited layers of homage, film after film. Tarantino will mix up the most ruggedly available genres and serve on a platter to you, a rare delicacy of intelligent, loud, bordering on arrogant (who's complaining) colourful and intoxicant-coated meaty cinema.Excuse the jumbled words; it's all that comes to mind after watching the Grindhouse Series.Grindhouse is a double feature, with Death Proof directed by Quentin Tarantino and Planet Terror by Robert Rodriguez. The series is a throwback to the 1970s exploitation cinema, with sex, violence and gore as an integral part of the thematic structure. Death Proof has all the regular ingredients: scantily clad, gutsy women, sudden violence, coupled with a quirky and eclectic soundtrack that is a typical Tarantino trademark. Tarantino's half features a story around 2 groups of women, one in Austin, Texas and a year later in Lebanon, Tennessee and how they separately battle out a serial killer, Stuntman Mike. Mike stalks beautiful women and brutally murders them in his car. The film follows various conversations of the sassy women and their plans, intercutting with Stuntman Mike's perspective of the women and their banter.The pace is distracting; with the slow conversations that require you to observe and listen so you can understand the characters better and heart-in-your-throat car sequences where you can see Stuntman Mike gruel it out with the ""powerpuff girls"" (Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms and Zoe Bell), but it all boils down to a 2 hour experience that entertains in a way that makes you want to be a part of the movie.The best part about Death Proof are the minute details that make you feel like the only thing missing in your movie watching experience is actually sitting in a theatre during the 1970s, on a deserted American Highway with seedy people beside you. The film includes faux scratches in the worn-out print; deliberately digitized audio wobbles and jump cuts that almost make you sit up, high-contrast cinematography and intervals of film trailers of non-existent movies from the same genre. Tarantino spends so much time on establishing the characters via long, rapid-fire conversations that you feel like an additional member on the table. You simultaneously want to wing a very heavy shoe at Stuntman Mike, just for being downright creepy. The DVD has an array of interesting features, including a poster gallery of trailers and posters of movies like Planet Terror, 1408, a documentary feature of stuntmen and women from the film called Stunts on Wheels: The Legendary Drivers of Death Proof, Finding Quentin's Gals, an interview with Tarantino and his casting options for the film and a snippet on stuntwomen Zoe Bell, who also features in the film.Contrary to its image, Death Proof is the perfect film for a pajama party night with the girls. With fleeting car actions, tangy background score, in depth exploration of a the dynamics of extreme characters in far-fetched, graphic novel type situations and a mesh of referential paybacks, Death Proof is like an indulgent account of Tarantino's unabashed ideas sandwiched into a delirious world.]"
599,"[To say that Pyaar Ka Punchnama relies heavily on the stereotyping women would be stating the obvious in an understated manner. But you are here; you are watching the film, might as well give in. And you see yourself in a land of puppies and bitches. Women are the most unreasonable, flaky, demanding, ruthlessly selfish kind of human beings. As a corollary, the other kind of humans is puppy-in-distress all the way from the eyes to the heart. If you manage to get past these obvious, annoying assumptions, there are a few situations; a few lines that make you smile because they remind you of someone you know. It is actually possible to enjoy the film if you assume that the writer/director, Luv Ranjan is not stupid enough to actually believe that all women fall in the intolerable, slappable category and all men are aawwww-so-cute-and-helpless. You have to give Luv the benefit of doubt and believe that he just happened to pick these characters. It's not like they don't exist in real life. After giving our writer/director so much, I enjoyed the characters. Only the men of course. Even as I blamed them for letting their women get them into unredeemable situations, the women themselves - at most times, I wanted to slap. In that sense the direction, the lines and the performances have succeeded. The only reason I won't rip apart the movie is the performances and what could have gone wrong with them. Each of the six main characters do a great job with their character. They actually behave like normal people. In fact, they surprised me. I'd be the last person to laugh or even smile at a monologue by a guy (Kartikeya Tiwari) about his frustrations with his girlfriend. Especially when it's long, oh-so long. But as it grew longer, it started making me laugh. Despite the repetition. I actually felt bad for the poor chap and his claustrophobic situation. If only the broad plots had a little more meat. They picked three similar starts, they chose three different situations and had three similarly ""bleh"" ways to end it. And yet it's one of those half-decent chick-flicks. I can see couples getting into an argument after watching it. And a movie that gets people to discuss it is a movie that has succeeded, even if it is in its own crooked way. This one made me wonder too. NO! not about the men and women in my life. About movies and their dependence on contrasts. A couple of weeks ago we saw Luv ka the end, where the guy was all out despicable and here we have a film that has made the woman in me hate some of the women the film represents. What's with the stark extremes? Is it because ""balance"" is boring?]"
600,"[Stanley ka Dabba, the title by itself warmed me up to the film. I used to be that lazy one in school who'd never get her ""tiffin box"". And this is after my little sister would pack it early in the morning. I don't know, my own dabba just never was fascinating enough. Years later, as I watch Stanley ka Dabba, I realize maybe it was a 'bonding' thing for me. Many friends made over shared parathas and buscuits. Sure, Stanley's reason for not bringing food for himself is as far from laziness as it could be, but the fact that he didn't have his meal with him brought the same result. Many friends and lovely memories. Despite this fondness though, Stanley ka Dabba seemed slow, predictable and repetitive in its 95 minute duration. Stanley ka Dabba's promo also makes you believe that there is going to be something really deep in the film that will take repeated viewings to deconstruct. It raises a question about Stanley's background that remains unanswered till the last ten minutes of the film. By then, you have pretty much made up your own sad story about his family and probable life-style situation. And the climax gives you exactly that. In that sense, the film is unpredictable, right? You were expecting something more, something beyond the superficial but didn't get it. But who says every film has to have a zen moment of realization? For what it is, Stanley ka Dabba is perfectly enjoyable because of its simplicity and how relatable it is. A science teacher who constantly asks you to stick to the norms, a unreasonable Hindi teacher who insists that the Goddess of knowledge will oblige only if you use the right hand. Stanley ka Dabba is all about simple things like these and the fact that every student who has come out of a traditional Indian school environment will find something to smile at. And if you can't identify with the events of the film, there's always Stanley to smile with. Partho plays the charming Stanley, a master story-teller, who has a very strong self-esteem. In fact, all the kids in the film are perfect in their roles - almost as if they aren't acting at all. The kids in the theater around me seemed to love every minute they spent with Stanley. They didn't seem to mind the slow pace or the repetition. It didn't matter that there seemed to be no valid reason for the angst and resolution thereof between Stanley and his Hindi teacher. Nor did they care that the climax does nothing outside the box. The protagonist is the hero and has a story that tugs the right strings for that lumpy throat. I'm really curious how the film is going to be liked at film festivals both Indian and international. The context is very Indian. In fact, it is documentation of the education system and the culture revolving in schools in India. Fortunately, the ""new-age"" schools might be changing the teacher-facing experience. Unfortunately though it might be changing the dabba experience too.]"
601,"[Ragini MMS is the same old spooky Hindi, supernatural film. In fact, the first half an hour or so of the film is like you are watching a sleazy, slow B-grade film with crass language and an attempt at overt ""sexual"" scenes. The only thing that stands the film apart from the rest of the films that fall in this bracket is the awesome performances. The one thing that completely cheeses me off is that these ""horror"" films have no real story. They titillate and are repititive. They don't really need a set up because even if you hate the character you don't want such bad things to happen to him. If he's that bad you want the punishment under your control maybe and not some mean and grumpy, old ghost. That's where the film succeeds. Uday Jhalla is a lousy, cheesy, creepy character and you want him to get away from the spirit. Raj Kumar Yadav squeezes every bit of aversion and later pity out of you. Kainaz Motivala too evokes sympathy through her naivete and helplessness. Despite the bleh first half, some of the spook-inducing decisions made in the second half were freaking awesome. The kind where even 95 minutes seem too long. In this duration it's not because Ragini MMS is a bad film but because you want that claustrophobia to go away. The director has done something right if every time the spirit speaks, my skin crawls. (Or could it be because it kept reminding me of Nandita Das' performance in Chitra Palekar's Marathi film, maati maay""?)You have to be a horror film lover to enjoy this one. Nope, there is no real titillation in terms of the sexual scenes indicated in the promos.Oh yeah, and here is my standard horror-film disclaimer. Basically, I can't handle them.]"
602,"[Every horror film review by me has to have the ""I HATE horror films"" disclaimer. I can't handle the creepy, crawling feeling a well-made horror film creates and sustains for the length of the film. And if the film is not well-made, well... Haunted had a few scares that work because of the timing but for the rest of the time you are either laughing at it or questioning the logic that it puts itself in. How can you be blamed for wondering why a spirit is struggling with doors and walls when at other times, it freely moves from room to room and even city to city without trouble. Yep, it's that kind of a film. The super-slow start builds zero suspense, because you can predict when a door is going to creak or a book is going to fall or a light is going to flicker. And this goes on and on and on, that too at a slow pace. It's surprising then, towards the climax, even though I knew how  the film is going to most likely end and my patience had worn out four times over, I felt for the protagonists and I wanted the spirit to die. And that I think is mostly due to the performances. While Mahakshay had pretty much only one expression to hold, he did it fine. Tia Bajpai made you feel for her especially in the rape scenes. Enough to control the damage caused by her voice and non-horrified scenes. The make-up of the spirits and the background music that goes with them are enough to scare you the few times they do.All this would have been acceptable if the story had anything new to offer. No, ""spirit"" experts illuminating us with ridiculous ways in which evil works, does not count. Same old troubled spirit haunting a house reaches out to an unsuspecting visitor decades, after the human body it lived in dies. Same old ways in which the spirit can be conquered. It's just too little to form entertainment (even the creepy/crawly kind). It matters little that the 3D technology used is completely wasted.]"
603,"[Some of the concepts that form Luv ka the end are sick. It's not that I don't believe that betting to woo a girl or similar stuff doesn't exist. But it forms the main theme of the film and this is passed off as entertainment for the youth and ""girl power"". That thought is disturbing. Ria, as the movie claims, is a simple, sweet virgin. She is in love with Luv (I can't make this stuff up!). And he loves her too. Hah! Gotchya! No, she is just a means to a devious end for him. When she finds out she does exactly what any girl with any dignity should do. And they enjoy every bit of it. Fair enough. But why does it have to be full of only run-of-the-mill toilet and sexual humor? The only saving grace is the charming presence of Shraddha KapoorI've always enjoyed campus stories. When I was younger I could identify with them and now they make me nostalgic. But, this is weird and worrisome. And it hardly a condolence that it's not ""Love"" spelt wrong in the title. ]"
604,"[""Cute"" is my first reaction to Shor in the city. Of course, not in the mush-mush kind-of way. It is after all, a dark comedy set deep in the grim, gritty recesses of a fractured city that we all make. But, a nag starts as soon as the main characters are introduced.As I enjoyed how well Shor in the city is shot and admired every performance, I was trying to point my finger at what was bothering me, what was keeping this from being a complete fun experience? When I read, ""Each incident is inspired by a newspaper story"" in the end credits, I realized the familiarity of the stories is what was bothering me. Not that I knew of the stories before hand, but this is how this new genre of ""dark comedy/pulp"" is beginning to settle in Hindi cinema. You have your mix of rugged texture, close-ups, relatively non-standard camera angles. Even story wise, you have a regular dose of hotch-potch of 4-5 stories with interesting characters. Their paths collide. And along the way, you make comments on the system we form, the society we make. In the social commentary department, Shor in the city chooses bribery, a sarcastic look at religion, stronghold of underworld crime, the hierarchy that a gun-holder can create, frustration of the honest man in this big, bad world. It uses a small-time crook who gets interested in the books he pirates to define both the futility, superficiality and yet the charm of the escape that a ""philosophical"" world creates. Oh yeah, and it also exposes our fake love for our national passion - cricket. The candid, uninhibited smooching and making out scenes announce the new-age cinema's emphatic decision to be bold and also shows how liberal the SMS/BPO center generation is. Given that none of these things are new to us, the performances make this film a watchable experience. Certainly, there are smart-ass dialogues but from Tusshar Kapoor to Pitobhash to Amit Mistry - each actor makes his character just perfect. Yeah, it is different from your mainstream films but within its genre it's ""more of the same"". In fact, it's one of those films in which no climax will surprise you - be it characters who die or the ones that survive. Fortunately, you mildly care for some of the characters and interested in what happens to them.]"
605,"[If you have even simply commuted to work using public transport, you know about that pesky co-traveller. You don't even need a trip longer than just-a-commute to know about that one. And imagine you are anal retentive, almost obsessive compulsive and that intrusive co-traveller is also unhygienic and loud. And now imagine this is you, but you are the third traveller watching one annoy the other. Damn funny, right? And why not? When you aren't the one suffering. And that's exactly what happens in Challo Dilli. Unfortunately, it goes overboard with the situations in the second half. You will have a smile pasted for every bit of the first half of the film. And then you see the writer's desperation to make the story a little more than just a regular road trip. You see them suddenly take a plunge into crime &amp; politics. Maybe this is their attempt at picking the pace a bit post-interval, but it didn't work for me.Maybe because I had settled into the lazy, pleasant stroll that the film had set-up. The shift in the quantity and quality of events thereafter came as a jolt. The subtle hints on the Mumbai vs. Delhi attitude, the city vs. small-town mentality, the upper middle class vs. lower middle-class divide transform into on-the-face comments about the society we live in and socio-politics take over.But with Vinay Pathak and his all-so refreshing performance, everything looks tolerable. That Lara Dutta wasn't acting as if she had no brains was an added bonus. They had some very nice witty, everyday language going on too. The well-executed camera work and the engaging background music made the experience even better. Usually, when these departments draw attention, it gets registered in my head negatively. But here they add a lot to the two hours spent on the film. Go along, be the third person watching all the fun on this funny, quirky journey, even if it's a DVD watch.]"
606,"[A social commentary on four very contemporary topics without getting into sermons, itself is an amazing experience. It's non-judgmental and makes you feel for each of its characters. Each story is so beautifully scripted that you don't really care if they are linked to each other or not. Nor does it bother you that you don't know how they all fit in on a timeline. You are willing to go with the flow and take it matter-of-factly when a character from one story appears in another one without any specific purpose.All that matters are the characters and what they are going through. Afia wants to be a mother, if she can't find a man, she'll get a donor. Everyone around her thinks she has gone nuts but you want to root for her. Megha is bitter, but you don't mind the resentment because she has after all been uprooted from her homeland in the most cruel fashion. How can you not feel for Abhimanyu who has been molested as a child, even though he has now turned into a person who doesn't mind using people around him. And Omar well, his story is more about the story and mistreatment afforded towards homosexuality rather than his character. You feel confused with the actors, you see their dilemma and their pain. If they are stubborn you want to give them the benefit of doubt. The treatment given to each story is consistent and has a very smooth flow. That must be some achievement considering it involved different teams working on each of them. Of course, there are times when you feel like there are some parts that you'd like to know more about. For example, Afia's story feels complete. But obviously for a topic as broad as the situation of the people in Kashmir, Megha's half-hour can do only so much justice. It still doesn't take away from the beauty that you feel bad for both her and her friend Rubina.Abhimanyu's story is also painted very broadly but then again, I'm not sure whether we want to know/see the gory details, especially when they are coming along with so many heavy issues. Same goes for Omar's homosexuality. The logistics are unclear but then again you don't know how much more you want to hear. All of this only makes me think that each one of these deserved a little more time, maybe even a film each. But as it stands, they are serious short films, have some brilliant performances, are well-shot and executed. A worthy watch, you just need to get into that serious mode.]"
607,"[Over the years, and multiple adaptations later, I have always found myself on the side of books in the book versus film debate. This holds true especially for the Harry Potter Series, The Lord of the Ring Series and the Dan Brown books. However, British detective fiction adaptations are slightly different. The Bond movies are a separate entity from the books - with the suave style and dramatization of the character of Bond, and the picturesque visuals that the movies incorporate. Which is why a debate surrounding a DVD series of Christie's The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd seemed like it would transgress mere extremes. BBC in collaboration with Carnival Films and ITV have been dramatizing Agatha Christie's Poirot series since 1989, but if there is one DVD that a Christie reader should want to pick up it would be The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd. The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd deals with a series of murders in the quite English countryside, King's Abbot, where Poirot had decided to retire. It starts with the murder of a wealthy businessman Ashley Ferrers, followed by the suicide of his wife, Dorothy Ferrers and then finally, her lover Roger Ackroyd, whose murder seems to be most peculiar. Poirot finds that the people around the victims are hiding much about their lives, and this forces him out of his retirement.The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd  has a romantic, serene picture and an old world charm to it - much like the language that the book uses. Christopher Gunning uses the violins as background music as a perfect blend to the calm flow and appeal of the narrative, but halfway through the movie you are slapped with an increasing pace of anxiousness. The movie carefully carves out that build up, which makes the film an interesting piece of detective fiction in isolation. A book like The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is multifaceted, deceptive and experimental - yet if one were to adapt it to a movie, there is only one-way to do it. The film has taken that route of transforming a 2-dimensional convoluted narrative, which determines the literary complexities of the structure into an easily narrated film. Poirot plays the part of merely a detective in the book, but in the film he becomes the central narrator. After watching one film, you want to go buy all the movies in the series, because you are left curious about the intricacies of the adaptations, and that is why this DVD series is such a delight - almost like a double treat. A near perfect adaptation of one of Christie's most complicated novels and a detailed, classy who-dun-nit for those of you who haven't read the book.Moreover, David Suchet is Poirot. The details are perfect in The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd , and other movies in the series. You'll notice Poirot is exactly what you would have imagined him to be after reading Christie's novels: quirky, observant, witty and unimaginably intelligent. Poirot is a typical detective, finding out the murderer before anyone can put together the pieces of the murders. Keenly observant of the smallest details and not willing to abandon even the most negligible clues.Having placed all the cards of this film on the table, it becomes essential to point out that no matter how well The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd   is adapted - which it is - there is nearly nothing like reading the book. It's a separate experience of jaw-dropping exhilaration. Watching the movie on the other hand is like assuming the position of an all-knowing parent - who knows the value of original but wants to applaud the courage of an earnest and striking visual adaptation. The debate has the same conclusion but watching The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd   will make you feel like it's a win-win situation. ]"
608,"[The set-up is as Harry Pottery as it could get. Orphaned child is used as a house servant by close relatives. He has two friends who make life livable for him. The plot deviates from here into bizarre situations. And somewhere in the strange world created, science is given all the credit. But, in the eyes of a 10-year old, it must all be fun. So, it'd be all right for kids to watch it when it comes around on TV.My issue with most of our stories is the lack of attention to detail. So our superhero 'zokkomon' doesn't have any superpowers, all he has is stuff enable by science. How then does he emit pretty lights around him? Maybe I'm just too scientifically challenged. But, it's all good because kids will oversee such stuff. They'll just be awed by the cool things this boy their age can do. That's what it looked like from the reactions of the kids sitting beside me. They were getting scared, exhilarated, laughing at all the intended points. And if it has worked for the target audience, it has worked. I think what worked is that the superhero didn't go beyond his age; the pranks he played were well within a child's imagination. He stayed that age, he didn't grow up suddenly into doing larger than life stuff. Darsheel Safary's charming, not-overly cute persona works well with what he has to do in and as Zokkomon. And he's a good performer too. I loved his expressions in the roller coaster ride. On the other hand, Anupam Kher was annoying as Deshraj. I think I have something against obvious wigs. But his role as Magic uncle was pretty amazing. His makeup was awesome and so was his demeanour. A pity that our writers don't believe in character-building. It's not like they can't or they don't know how to, because they started something really interesting by having the yin and the yang, in the form of science and emotions. But it's not taken any further, there's no high point of conflict. Oh well, maybe that's too heavy for a kids' film. For what it is, the film is not good enough to haul the kids to a theater and cough up for the mandatory popcorn and soda. But it's perfect for a 2 hour off-time from kids when it plays on TV. ]"
609,"[It's nice to see a film-maker, whose focus is 'style', trying to talk about the victimized middle class. He tries to say that their only hope against their helplessness is by taking responsibility and trusting no one but themselves. Sounds too deep and dark for a mainstream film? Well worry not, the film doesn't take itself that seriously because it is made up of some of the most ridiculous lines and has situations taken straight from the mafia films in the 90s. Only that present day Jeevan seems to be Aditya Pancholi. Can it get any sadder than that? Yes, it can.The hour-long, pre-interval screen time is spent only in set-up. It introduces its 5-6 main characters and lays out the situation - none of which you can care about because there is zero attempt by any character to connect with me AND there is nothing compelling about the story so far.Whatever happens after that has to work twice as harder to become interesting. An uphill task that only gets steeper. While most of the moves, twists and turns are predictable, there are actually a few events that took me by surprise - more like ""wow, they actually did that in a Hero-oriented, Hindi film"" than ""whoa! Didn't see that twist coming! Cool!!""The only thing ""cool"" about the film is the conceptualization of some of the scenes, in terms of post-production work, including editing. Rest is all blah comes and bigger blah goes. No, lines trying too hard to be cool dialogue don't count. That is, throwing in 'facebook','twitter','google' in a line won't make it hip and popular.That ""Abhishek Bachchan"" attitude has worn off long-long ago. What's the point of a pause in a sentence, if you can predict when it's going to come because you know the actor so well now? Prateik Babbar doesn't look one bit like the seventeen year old he plays. He tries to whine like one though. Rana literally looked like a block of moving wood which would making grunting, squeaky voices every once in a while. Bipasha Basu's role has absolutely nothing important about it.At some level, I guess the roles of everyone other than ACP Kamath (Abhishek Bachcan) were meant to create pathos for the plight of the Goan middle-class population stuck between a corrupt administrations and drug dealers. But, it just doesn't get there. It'd also have been interesting to see a couple of things explored further, for example, Kamath's misjudging people, or a misused woman's internal struggle. But that would be out-of-tone depth for such a superficial film. I mean, we are talking about an Additional Commissioner of Police breaking into rap while cleansing the streets of Goa. Where's the room for complexity and profundity here?Story-wise whatever there is to see in the film, you've already seen in the promos of the film or in a film from the 80s-90s. The only marvel is the use of color and light and the visual treatment given to some of the scenes.]"
610,"[I don't know what the filmmakers felt while making the film or even while watching the film in its entirety for the first time. Teen Thay Bhai was certainly embarrassing to watch. And this is despite the film being devoid of sexual humor. Just watching three great performers going from one unfunny gag into another is extremely uncomfortable.You still remember Om Puri's brilliant performances despite some really awful scripts he's picked; Shreyas Talpade doesn't need to prove his comic timing anymore; and Deepak Dobriyal is someone who has graduated from smaller, indie films into a performer you look forward to, however tiny his role. And they have a perfectly funny situation laid out before them. They are 3 brothers who hate each other but are forced to spend time together. Unfortunately, the only few times you do laugh/smile is owing to the actors 'rising above' the script and lines they are handed. At other times, all you want to tell the makers is ok, we get the whole shirtless Salman mockery you are trying to pull, but it's not funny just because Dobriyal is doing it.You know how any 'respectful' Hindi family film is going to end when it starts with hatred. And the writers try to show how we try to find someone to blame for our weaknesses, but it's too plain and too in-the-face, they try subtlety and then give up, just in case the audience doesn't 'get' it. Besides you cannot have a story with no ups and downs, just one flat tone that the audience can choose to ignore and doze off. And no, an irrelevant sub-plot involving foreigners and cops doesn't help!Interesting though, the movie starts and maintains some very good production values. Especially the lighting. They used very low lighting and maintained grays and browns despite the genre of the film. But then flashbacks are uses as an excuse to go into a contrast in tone - loud colors, background music. They are also used as an excuse to infuse romance, song &amp; dance, and drama in the plot. This change in ambiance is disorienting. But that's immaterial because it's not like brown/gray/low-light 'style' make the writing or the lame jokes better. I'm confused. What do I feel worse about? High-budget films without a story or low-budget, indie films produced by the likes of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra paying no attention to the writing.]"
611,"[If you are an avid film buff, you wouldn't buy or rent Taken's DVD just by looking at its cover. It has a cryptic picture of Liam Neeson and a very blah line: ""I don't know who you are, but if you don't let my daughter go, I will find you and kill you."" Deja vu? Precisely my point. It's a very seen-that-heard-about premise: daughter gets kidnapped, daddy has to run all over the park to find her back. No wonder when it released, despite positive reviews, the film had a very poor start at the box-office. Nevertheless, thanks to word-of-mouth publicity, it achieved some level of success on DVD.That's more or less how I chanced upon the film - it's theatrical release was a blink-and-miss. But strong recommendations from friends were forthcoming. I'm never been much of a Liam Neeson fan but this film has made me one. It's clear that he's a casting agent's delight as far as thrillers are considered. And looking back, I'd probably have cast him in the film adaptations of the Dan Brown novels (The Da Vinci Code, Angels &amp; Demons.)Taken is pretty much what the DVD cover says it to be - Bryan Mills (Neeson), a father separated from his daughter and wife, will do everything he can to get her back when she gets kidnapped on an overseas holiday in France, with her girlfriend. There's a catch here: the kidnappers do not want any ransom.The film is racy, full of action, and wastes no time in verbosity. Mills is a former CIA agent and his pursuit of the kidnappers is fraught with little obstacles. On a lighter note, I wondered if the film-makers are suggesting that to nail down criminals, the world may not produce an Iron Man or Batman, but someone with an extensive career behind him in the CIA is equipped with all necessary skills - investigative, medical, physical and even flirtatious - to conquer all odds.I was most impressed with how the screenplay trimmed each scene just at the right time. The fights are extremely well-shot. As a viewer, if you feel your arms getting a gentle involuntary jerk to punch the villians on screen, it is clear that the film has got your complete attention in a hypnotic way. Another good reason why you may like Taken, and even empathise, or even get frightened by the context of the kidnapping is the manner in which it unfolds. I won't be surprised if you remember Taken when you're travelling to a new city and mull over a request from a stranger to share a taxi ride. There's a message somewhere. As a Facebook and Twitter civilisation, we're witnessing the decline of barriers in trusting people. Taken doesn't sermonise on this issue - it rather portrays this tension through Mills' character who is shown to be a rather worrisome father. As a former CIA agent, he cannot trust people easily - he's seen too much of the ugly side of governments, rebellious groups and white collar criminals. I'm glad the film-maker kept film free of any such monologues. Though, the ending was a little incomplete. By the way it concluded, it felt like the ending of a 'Father's Day' film.The true heroes of Taken are its direction and screenplay. Director Pierre Morel, known best as a cinematographer makes a formidable team with his writers Luc Besson (the Transporter series, the La Femme Nikita television series) and Robert Mark Kamen (the Karate Kid series, Gladiator, The Fifth Element) to put together a film that's an edge-of-the-seat thriller in the true sense.You need not prepare to watch this film. Just eject the DVD tray, load the film, get some popcorn and enjoy.]"
612,"[One distinguishing factor about Shyamalan - the Brand is that his movies can be easily placed into two extreme categories: Stimulating Good and Hair-wrenching bad. If The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs fall into the former category, you know what The Village and Lady In The Water can make you feel. It's as if he delivers in alternates - and that also holds true about his latest film Devil. Devil is a story that worked itself out in the inner recesses of Shyamalan's head and was given form by screenwriter Brian Nelson (of 30 Days of Night fame) and Director John Eric Dowdle (of Quarantine fame). First part of the Shyamalan produced Night Chronicles, Devil is based on a premise called the Devil's Meeting - where the Devil takes human form, traps the sinned in an unknown location, and kills them only after torturing them. Devil deals with the same foundation where 5 people are stuck in an elevator and each gets murdered one after another during occasional blackouts. Shyamalan has admitted that the film is loosely based on Agatha Christie's novel 'And Then There Were None', and that his main inspiration behind the film is Hitchcock. With this background - the writer, director, premise and influences - Devil sounded like a chilling, mind-bender. Allow me to place a two-sided argument of the movie before we can decide which category this movie falls under. You can't go terribly wrong with a regular whodunit that has Hitchcock and Christie footprints all over it. Devil has a classic eye-popping twist in the end and a couple of bumps throughout the film, which will make the anticipated chill stop midway through your spine - but it's not something you haven't experience before. Fernando Velazquez provides the typical horror movie background music- banging high octave piano keys like someone is taking slow cautionary steps. The cinematography moves between tight shots of the people trapped in the elevator to establish claustrophobia, which is inter-cut with crane shots of the sky-scrapper in which these people are stuck. The symbolism is meaty, and still a bit overdone - it becomes cloudy and grey the minute these people get stuck, bang in the middle of the 40 odd floors of the building in the 6th elevator. There is definitely a melodramatic, old school charm to Devil; it's the perfect amalgamation of a Christie novel, a Hitchcock thriller and contemporary horror visuals. The problem with such an arrangement is the lack of originality - there is nothing new that Devil offers as a 2010 film. If you have read and seen enough of the horror/thriller genre you will be able to make correct guesses about the film, but you'll still want to sit it out, because such formulas never go wrong. The DVD of Devil has a few extended trailers, deleted scenes that don't contribute much to the film - if anything the film is crisp because it is only 79 mins long. The DVD also includes a featurette on the making of the film - which is a little arrogant during Shyamalan's interview but also intriguing when it discusses the myths surrounding the premise of the film. Devil won't excite you like a guilty pleasure would, but its 79 minutes decently spent, if you're in the mood for an average movie with a fine fusion of influences. Watch Devil because you won't be disappointed with the overall experience of the film. Almost like your indulgence in junk food would be - it's good in an inviting way but not stimulating. ]"
613,"[Know that feeling when you're about to bid farewell to someone? You've got the flow sorted in your head - you will probably hug, look into each other's eyes, maybe even kiss, make promises that you will call, upload pictures.... and then suddenly someone - maybe a common friend - pops on the scene and spoils the moment, spoils the entire plan that you had in your head.  That's the beginning of David Lean's Brief Encounter.Lovers Laura (Celia Johnson) and Dr. Alec (Trevor Howard) are about to bid farewell to each other, for good. And the moment is spoiled by a rather chatty and intrusive Dolly (Everley Gregg), familiar to Laura. It's tragic and when all Alec is able to do is gentle press Laura's shoulder to offer her comfort, your heart reaches out to them.You however realise the complete nuisance and magnitude of Dolly's intrusion only by the end of the film. By that time, you've seen Laura retreating into a shell of her thoughts, sitting in front of her husband, imagining the brief affair with Alec and narrating an imaginary confession of sorts, detailing how they met, where they went, what they did and how she felt through all this.An extra-marital affair, borne out of a stable, happy marriage is a bad thing. But here's where Laura still managed to win sympathy - the honesty with which she explains her predicament, is touching. You realise that before she could know the social impossibility of her affair, Laura and Alec have fallen in love out of pure innocence. What I found even more convincing was the manner in which they fall in love - no stunts, no songs, just a few cups of tea, hanging out together and a rather engaging conversation after, Laura finds herself absorbed in his eyes.A big question popped up in my head though - and it's a trick which women in cinema have fallen for (reminded me of Billy Wilder's The Apartment especially). When you and a woman you know are coincidentally going for the same show for a movie, is she ever going to be impolite and say, 'I'm alone, I've got a balcony seat, and I hope we're not sitting together.'? Her politeness on the contrary is where she gives in and the man takes the bait and the rest is history. Something similar happens in Brief Encounter. Laughing together looking in the same direction, can produce some strange signals between a man and woman.I'm a big fan of using restraint in films. In Brief Encounter, I liked the way David Lean never made the two lovers go over the top - their romance is a subtle, restrained and completely self-aware of it's wrong-doing (a momentary kiss is halted by shadows of people). If this film was re-made today, it would break all forms of explicitness.An interesting parallel I observed was that between Laura's family life and her meeting Alec. The first time she goes out with Alec, she returns home to find her son unwell. It's a gentle sign, but worthy enough to indicate disapproval of the scheme of things. My favourite metaphor in the film was how Noel Coward's screenplay begins Laura and Alec's relationship - minutes before they bump into each other, Laura is troubled by a speck of dust in her eye. The Hindi phrase 'aankhon mein dhool jhonkhna' being used as a symbol to start an illegit affair - nice touch, Mr Coward!At 86 minutes, Brief Encounter lives up to its title. It's an engaging watch, filled with great lines, classic romantic moments and a performance by Celia Johnson that's worthy of the Oscar nomination she received.]"
614,"[One would think we have enough films with three philandering husbands cheating on their gullible wives. Anees Bazmee is not that one. It's not the cheating that bothers me as it is the crassness and the way my mind goes numb for hours after watching such films. So, I actually looped with joy when there was no line at the online ticket counter. And the queue for current tickets was empty too! (I promise this had nothing to do with ample parking space available.)  An almost empty theater - die senseless films, die! And just before the film started I said, ""come on Mr. Bazmee, make me regret my happiness."" Nope not this time.It's weird because the concept and where it's leading gives you the sense that it is anti-man and pro-woman. But, could it be any more derogatory to women if all main leads of the film have only one use for the fairer gender? Also, it wasn't comforting at all that only a man could bring a solution to all the women's problems. I'm no feminist (at least in the popular sense of the term) and don't mind seeing women as they are. But, a woman is either super-gullible or a piece of pretty furniture, seriously? We don't really expect much in terms of acting from Celina Jaitley and actually she isn't on screen long enough to prove either way. Don't look at me boys, forward your complaints to Azmee. Sonam Kapoor still comes across as Bollywood's bachchi (kiddo), because the directors seem to be giving her one emotion per film. In this one she's made an unsuccessful attempt at sobbing to try and gain our sympathy. We are a desensitized lot, Baby Kapoor, you need to try harder and it better be quick, we aren't very patient either. And Rimi Sen can't blame herself. We have seen some awesome comic timing from her. She tries a fair bit here too, it just doesn't work. Well, if Irrfan Khan doesn't work, what else can? It's almost as if the director didn't want his actors to perform well. Suniel Shetty does the slapsticky bit (he made me laugh a couple of times) and Bobby Deol does the Bobby Deoly bit. Yes. That's it. That's all I have to say. Yes. That's my attempt at refusing to acknowledge any other ""star"" in the film who continues to assault my intelligence and gets support to do it again and again and again. This is my sign of 'non-support'. ]"
615,"[Majid Majidi's universe is full of do-gooders. It's where you can trust people with your money. No matter how economically challenged you are, you're always kind to share your meal with a guest. Customers at a shop don't whisk away extra-change you may have handed over by mistake. People are extremely hospitable, welcoming and innocent. Crime, murders are unheard of. People tell lies, but for a larger good. There are no human villians in his films. If any, the enemy is a product of circumstances - often intangible, something the protagonist must overcome. That's exactly the context of The Song of Sparrows. Karim (Reza Naji) who works at an ostrich farm on the outskirts of Tehran, wants to loan some money from his boss, so that he can buy a hearing aid for his daughter since the one she used to wear has stopped working after it fell in a dirty cesspool. Poor Karim faces an uphill task to generate that money, after he gets fired from his job thanks to a moment of  carelessness that leads an ostrich to escape from the farm.The Song of Sparrows captures Karim's loss of innocence as he frequents the city every day posing as a motorbike pilot who ferries people and heavy goods. Although he earns well by doing this, every piece of city scrap he begins to accumulate in his backyard becomes a symbol of the degradation of the generous and good-hearted Karim he was once known for.It's a fantastic message, told most beautifully through simple vignettes - Karim's refusal to part with a beautiful blue door his wife donated to the neighbours, his violent outrage when he spots his children selling roses on the highway - all these become signs of a Karim who is now as acid tongued as the grime his face  accumulates driving around the city all day. Through Karim's character, Majidi's not saying that life in the city is bad; he's just saying that people change when they spend a lot of time in an urban setup. It's a universal truth, isn't it? Something snaps inside Karim in this daily grind to the city. He loses something that his family and friends treasured about him. The film's plot is about how he regains his old self, under pressure from circumstances and a little help from his family.Visually, this is one of Majidi's most arresting films - so arresting, you can almost smell the Irani soil. The first 15 minutes of the film are pure eye candy where lensman Tooraj Mansuri's camera captures the grace of an ostrich run and the aburdity of a chase, against the dry landscape. They are my most lasting impressions of the film. The close-ups of Karim's face throughout the course of the film are important - you discover that Reza Naji is so good, just a tweak of his cheek muscles is worth a thousand emotions stirred up inside him.Majidi's films always have a hidden relationship with water. It's also a case in The Song of Sparrows, except he adds another regular from his films - goldfish. Part of the film's official poster, a scene involving the transportation of hundreds of goldfish, is the most moving sequences in the film, shot with Majidi's characteristic slow-motion. I found myself in tears by the end of it.I've seen almost all of Majidi's internationally acclaimed films so far - Children of Heaven, The Colour of Paradise, Pedar, Baran. This film is the latest addition. As it got over and I settled down to mull over the film, I found myself asking one question: Does Majidi's universe really exist? Are Persians genuinely as good as Majidi portrays them to be? Interestingly, while I may not be sure about answers to those questions, I'm at least convinced about one thing - we always manage to sympathise with the protagonists of his films. Perhaps that's why people all over the world love his films. Perhaps that's why they're acclaimed by both critics and audiences globally - a feat sometimes very difficult to achieve. Perhaps that's why they call him Magic Majidi.]"
616,"[It is striking how FALTU makes you aware of our climb up the Maslow's need pyramid. Gone are the days of worrying about roti, kapda aur makaan. We are now looking at a generation who wants to be trained entertainers. And that is what makes FALTU contemporary. Alas! The methodology used is not convincing and thus along with the few jokes you can only laugh at the writers' naivete. It will soon be fashionable to make a film about our thoroughly flawed educational system. And isn't it a good thing that we don't expect profound and workable solutions from our films? FALTU doesn't either. But, I do like the basic concept and the way director, Remo has tried to execute it. If only it was a little funnier than it eventually is, with lines, with performances.There were certainly a couple of hilarious, laugh-out-loud scenes. And there are other times that you might not be able to control your smile at the silliness of the situation. But, when a movie sets out to talk about social issues, it needs to leave a lasting impression by whatever means possible. Humor works at most times, but in this one, it doesn't. Especially, if you give away 2-3 of your main punch jokes in the trailer.One reason of course, is that not all the supposedly funny lines make you laugh, though the intention is clear. As a side, you also get a few lectures on the ""right way"" to encourage your kids if they aren't academically bright. Also, though the writing tries hard to make characters behave differently from each other, they do end up without any outstandingly distinguishing factors. The other reason glaring in your face is the inadequate and loudish performances. If only FALTU had a little less of an Uday-Chopra look alike. I mean it is ok if one looks like the other, but why do both of them have to have that silly grin on their face. It just doesn't allow me to go beyond that and look at what might be acting. Sure Puja Gupta is the only saving grace in this department. Yeah, this despite having both Riteish Deshmukh and Arshad Warsi - two of the best we have in terms of comic timing. Again, I'd put the blame on the superfluous writing. There is just no attention paid to their characters.Despite all of this though, the basic plot tries its best to remain true to its theme and the spirit of the film. The bunch of controlling parents is no new concept to the way many of us might have grown up. To see it on screen gives us a sense of camaraderie even. You can hear an entire generation shouting ""LET GO!"" when a son says that to a father. AND there's that last dance in the climax (no, not the closing credits, the one that is a part of the actual film). I could watch it over and over again and bumped up the rating a bit just for that one last masterpiece. ]"
617,"[We are grade 'A' fools, who aren't at all exposed to any kind of cinema other than the one dished out in the name of 'style' and 'thrill'. We don't watch the umpteen Television series from around the world from our couch, so we don't know what the very basics of a murder mystery. Yes, I'm furious. What are we in the eyes of our filmmakers? Deprived souls who have to be thankful for whatever we get?Maybe I wouldn't have been this irked if they had fulfilled at least one of the things they set out to achieve - style or substance. The story has zilch in terms of drama or suspense. No, pausing before every word of every dialogue doesn't fulfill that need to be nervous about what's going to happen next. If you make me hang for every word you say, literally, I will doze off. The style is largely superficial too. Even if you disregard the fact that there's nothing you haven't seen earlier. Unless the last you saw a Hindi film was 15 years ago, then the style might hold something for you. But then again, I'd recommend the film directed by the person who produced this film - Don.Geez, who'd have known that a day would come when I'd recommend a Shahrukh Khan film over an Abhishek Bachchan one. It was cool when Abhishek walked that lop-sided stylish walk or sat lounging heavy on one side, clad in white against a red backdrop. After the first time though it's called repetition and predictable. You got to give me something more interesting than that. Especially when the next in line to try and impress me is Kangna Ranaut trying to finish off her English lines in a hurry. Sheeeesh! Sorry for the break in flow, but I just can't get over on how much one can be blind to the banality of the basic plot! Not to mention that whatever Abhishek's character does is a tangent to the main plot. And the writer's confusion is transparent - should I focus on the main plot or should I make the sub-plot bigger so we can offer it to a mainstream actor. You know what, I ""shhuushed"" the guy sitting next to me in the first hour because he kept saying, ""what a bore yaar!"" And when the main ""twist"" came along, I wouldn't have the heart to resist if that guy forced my foot into my mouth. Not fair. The filmmakers have actually made me feel bad about doing the right thing. I actually wanted that guy to pay attention to their film. ]"
618,"[You know a director has grabbed your attention well into his film, when you refuse to believe that a rustling behind the bushes is just a false alarm. Director Kevin McDonald successfully does that in one of the initial scenes in The Eagle and from there on, it's an absorbing film throughout.McDonald already has a reputation as a director. He directed the Oscar winningThe Last King of Scotland besides the critically acclaimed State of Play. This time he's tried his hand at a period drama. Based on the novel, The Eagle of The Ninth, this film is set in the year 140 AD, and tells the story of Marcus Aquila (Channing Tatum), a young Roman soldier who embarks on a quest to find his lost legion's golden emblem, 'the eagle' which went missing some years ago. The emblem was defended by his father's army - 5,000 soldiers - who are believed to have died in that conquest, after they tried to conquer British territory, outside the Roman empire. Several attempts were made to retrieve the men and the emblem they so proudly defended, but in vain. In fact, before Aquila, whoever embarked on a similar journey never returned alive.The film is a pure adventure and one that's fraught with challenges of trust, endurance, hunger and survival from the enemy of tribals. Aquila, is joined by a Brit, Esca (Jamie Bell) who despite being a prisoner of war, is sworn to loyalty as a slave.I loved this contrast between the two characters - the Roman Aquila takes the help of his enemy, a Brit (Esca) to find an emblem that matters only to the Romans. Esca's characterisation is wonderful and it shows remarkable colours during their journey together, often surprising us and convincing us that humanity always triumphs over evil.I'd have liked it if Aquila's character had been fleshed out a little better - what makes him so passionate about retrieving the legion? What was his life like after his father disappeared in that infamous incident and how did he train to be so strong? Some history to how Esca became a slave amongst the Romans would also have added some meat to the screenplay, especially during their journey together.Stories which are about the search for something precious, something that was lost and retrieved, must build enough cause into the conquest. For example, why is the Eagle emblem so important? Why does the honour of the empire matter so much? The result is a very flat, wooden story of two men searching for something and an army determined not to let them have it. It's entertaining alright, and their journey is very watchable. What wrecks me is that this could have turned out from being merely a good film, to a really good film, with just a little more effort.The action scenes, the slow-mo are well-choreographed. Tatum looks a lot like Owen Wilson (without the broken nose) and I felt he's a bit wooden throughout the film. If there's one thing I'd change about this film, it would be Tatum - he seems like the wrong choice for the lead role.Costume dramas have this ability to transport you into a different world. This film tries to, but right from the first shot, there seems something odd. I wondered whether the actors were doing a dress rehearsal, because the actors' dialogues do not have an ancient stamp about them. Also, after being on the road for so many days, how come Aquila and Esca don't grow a beard? It's what I call, 'typos' in a film.Despite these drawbacks, The Eagle is still worth a visit. It may not register as a movie you'd remember for a long time, but it is engaging in a good way, while it lasts.]"
619,"[Playing around with the timeline is cool and must be fun too when you are making a film. It stands out as different and keeps the audience alert. But NOT when the price you pay is holes in the main plot. When that happens non-linear narration take away a lot from the film, instead of adding value. And that is exactly what happens in Monica. In his effort to keep us thinking, director, Sushen Bhatnagar forgets to give us some key events in the story. The ones that could have gotten us more interested in the characters and feel for them. The only emotion I feel for Monica Jaitley, is ""maybe, she deserved it."" Which would be fine if I thought Sushen Bhatnagar wanted us to feel that way. But, the way her case is put forth by her parents' lawyer, it looks like Sushen wanted sympathy from us. I felt a little sorry for the small-town girl, Monica who is under her husband's shadow; maybe she has talent, but she doesn't quite believe she is good for anything. I would have been proud of the confident, enigmatic person she changes into, if I knew what brought about the change. If I am not a part of that transformation, it just comes across as a mere convenient jump for the storywriter. The film also refuses to answer other important questions. What is the big deal about becoming a ""special correspondent""? Can one ""special correspondent"" really cause any sort-of damage to a powerful politician - a politician who doesn't need to say who he wants out of his way, people around him just know? Why and how did the mass population get interested in justice for Monica? And these are only unanswered questions. There is a whole different list of logical loopholes. A sample - Why is the judge humoring a lawyer who is going on and on with irrelevant conjectures? I got tired of him, didn't the judge? Sure he keeps saying it is relevant, but not once, are you told how. Fortunately, though it is not all bad. I liked the bits where Monica is confronting her fears. Divya Dutta gives an extremely strong performance. I'm sure the actor had to completely drain herself out for some of the scenes. If for nothing else, I'd watch this film because it gives an actor who has always played side roles, a chance at carrying the film. And she does, to whatever extent the writing allows her. Beyond that it is the writer's failure. The writer also should've given the other characters a chance too. They are  all pretty one-dimensional and don't get you involved one bit. Two characters who really deserved more and had actors to carry them off too - Monica's loser husband, Raj (Rajit Kapoor) and the menace-cum-gentleman politician (Ashutosh Rana). Raj gets marred by some theatrical acting (not that the actor can't do anything else) and the politician is left half-baked.It's sad that a project that has interesting characters, a compelling story couldn't become a watch-worthy film. The culprits being - the details in the writing and a failed attempt at stylized execution.]"
620,"[Paul Giamatti's face and features usually land him only comic roles. This is his coming of age film, where he transitions from comic actor to someone who can deliver so much more, with extreme maturity. Although the title may not suggest it to be, Barney's Version is romantic in parts, a memoir in some and a witty comedy while it lasts. It's a breezy, nostalgic ride through the life of the Jew, Barney Pagnofsky, a television producer of amateur dramas, who reflects on his life's highs and lows, love gained and lost, at a time, when he is grappling with Alzheimer's.The film begins with shades of a comedy and you can't help avoid that thought, looking at Giamatti's face.  But soon you realise that director Richard J Lewis does not draw caricatures with his characters. That's the biggest strength of this film - just when you think the situation is hinting itself to going down the comic highway, the screenplay pulls the brakes right there. Dustin Hoffman, who plays Barney's father, a retired detective adds much of the colour to the proceedings (the 'meet-your-parents' dinner, Barney's wedding and the cemetery scenes are memorable), but he never forces his wit into conversations. Instead he and Barney are seen confronting life's challenges with a pinch of salt. That's the kind of father, one would love to have.What begins to look like a memoir, ultimately lands up in the alleys of mush, head-over-heels romance, marriage and raising up kids. It's not exactly what I expected out of the film, but not something I'd mind. By keeping the focus of the film on the most important part of his life, marriage - the screenplay does find a focus. Barney's story of falling in love again is one of the cutest chapters in this film. Miriam (Rosamund Pike) is perfect as Barney's companion and her character, as that of an understanding wife (but only up to a point) is essayed very well in the screenplay.This is clearly Giamatti's best performance. He has undergone some very meticulous make-up (especially his beard) to portray different periods of his life and at each stage, he seems wonderful in character. I felt my mouth open in shock, in a crucial outburst scene. What makes him stand-out and easy to identify with, is because in totality, Barney is just like one of us - sometimes he goes the extra length to achieve things, sometimes he is insecure, he drinks a bit too much alright, but he is truthful. He does make mistakes and he regrets them later. Sometimes he is lucky and sometime he gets nailed.Not only does the direction help bring out those shades beautifully, some wonderful editing (Susan Shipton) helps. The fade-ins and dissolves seem so neat and trimmed, they are perfect finishes to every small chapter in the film.It's a pity that this film will sink without a trace thanks to poor publicity. It's got acclaim at film festivals and award shows, but Golden Globe winner Paul Giamatti is not exactly a household name amongst Indian audiences.Expect day shows to be cancelled in most multiplexes, because very few people will turn up. In order for that not to happen, I recommend to go and watch this one! You'll enjoy Barney's life story.]"
621,"[I think Zack Snyder makes a film, by reversing the traditional flow-chart - he first does post-production planning, followed by the shooting. At the end, he figures how to perfect that script from the graphic novel and identifies a story somewhere.Understandably, actors on his sets must be rarely challenged - all those cool and stylish effects, digital re-touching, mixing that so are typical of his films, that performances would be so boring. Imagine shooting bullets at imaginary objects, piercing the sword into non-existent creatures, being suspended from wires and surrounded by the chroma screen, all the time. Style over substance, therefore, is a trait of Snyder's films. That still works to his advantage, since he never chooses to adapt Shakespeare on screen. Comics - a.k.a graphic novels - have rarely tried being about 'substance'. Which is why, he's possibly the best man alive, who can bring a graphic novel alive on screen. Sucker Punch confirms it - his command over technique and craft, such as sound design and mixing, cinematography, action choreography, editing, visual effects, make-up, is impeccable.Which is why, there's so much visual and audio stimuli for a viewer to experience this film on the big screen. And it is therefore that I recommend, that if you want to form an honest opinion about this film - no matter how bad - you've got to head to your nearest multiplex. It would be criminal to experience Sucker Punch on DVD, or any screen shorter than the big screen.Sucker Punch isn't half as good as his last outing, 300, which achieved cult following despite being panned by critics. The adaptation isn't bad, it's just that the story falls flat. Moreover, this Charlie's Angels-meets-Matrix, fantasy action thriller has an overdose of blondes. The storyline is simple - the lead protagonist, helpless Babydoll (Emily Browning) is sent to a mental asylum by her evil stepfather where she retreats into a fantasy-filled escape plan, by finding a set of clues.Since it's HER fantasy, she is magically rewarded with samurai-like sword fighting skills as well as powers to float around at her own choice of gravitational force, before slaughtering dragons and other video-game essentials. Joining her on this escape mission, are a few other pretty young things (PYTs) - Sweet Pea (Abby Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung).The plot defies logic and any bit of thought or morals that the script tries to pontificate is absolutely absurd and I didn't get any of it. You shouldn't try to either - if you're looking for a take-away from a film, bad idea.I however did enjoy Snyder's treatment of action sequences, the special effects and all the jazz that has come to characterise his films - the rich color tones, soundtrack laden with rock music, the slow motion fight sequences and the gore. The soundtrack, in fact does immense charity to helping improve the viewing experience.Amongst the women, Jena Malone (who played Carine McCandless in Into The Wild) and Abby Cornish are good, but Emily Browning proves to be a major disappointment. I got introduced to her - especially her sexy pout - in Lemony Snickett's A Series of Unfortunate Events, and although she fires bullets and punches the baddies pretty well, that blonde hairdo and ponytails makes her appear too dumb. Oscar Isaac's performance as Blue Jones, the evil pimp to all these women, is noteworthy.Sucker Punch falls into that category of films which advise you to leave your brains at home. Simple as it may sound as a suggestion, it is an incredibly difficult anatomical feat to pull off. Our brains and heart better be together. Why not then, Mr Scriptwriter, do you do us a favour by working a little harder. ]"
622,"[Picture a smile creeping up your face; but you find yourself stopping it because what you want to smile about is a very serious matter. Mostly because you don't even know what is making you smile. Immediately after that, you find yourself with a lumpy throat and wide, horrified eyes - viewing something that makes your gut wrench. This is an experience Bahman Ghobadi's Turtles Can Fly will bring to you. A film set in a Kurdish Refugee camp, on the Turkish border of Iraq, graphs the everyday lives of children, before the US invasion, who have been living the atrocities of their limbo state. The film revolves around three main characters - Satellite (Sohran Ebrahim) the youngest authoritarian in the village - a boy who is most resourceful. He controls all the children who diffuses landmines with their bare hands and exchange them for machine guns in the local market. On the other hand, there's brother-sister Agrin and Hyenkov, the calmest yet most affected children of the lot. Hyenkov has no hands; he uses his lips to diffuse the mines. Agrin is quiet throughout the film, but in her eyes you can virtually see the entire war. It's a helpless, weak and desolate perspective which reminds you every minute how lucky you are to be only watching the film. More than loss of innocence, Turtles Can Fly also deals with a bunch of beautifully alarming paradoxes. For one, you can see the villagers and children looking forward to the US invasion because what they most desire is the fall of Saddam. Yet they call the land mines ""American"". It's almost hard to believe these children are teenagers, being equipped with such hard responsibilities and no security - yet you can see them making merry out of the little they have, walking around with one hand or one leg and smiling like there's literally no tomorrow. Maybe it's a distinct childlike quality or maybe it's just their idea of living life king-size. Keeping the emotional overtone in the film aside, Turtles Can Fly uses beautiful imagery to juxtapose the horrid state of the people. The cinematography is detailed and colourful, incorporating the same sense of paradox that binds the film together. The performances of each child actor is natural and endearing, making you rightly believe that they are too busy trying to survive to have an opinion on the politics of the war. As an audience, it makes you realize how beautifully Iranian films are shot despite their controlled, government-funded budget.Primary reason to pick up a Turtles Can Fly DVD is the interview with the same children from the film. It's a non-professional cast and therefore the children mostly talk about their experience while filming. In these interviews, you can see a dripping innocence and a mischievous imprint of the children - the same quality which is lost in the film. The DVD also has a few extended theatrical trailers of the film.The realities slap you in the face with every passing second but it also has a surreal after-ring to it. Turtles Can Fly is sprinkled with magical realism - you know it can't get more real than this and yet there is a fantastic sense in their attitudes and lifestyle. This feeling is best expressed with one hard-hitting yet surreal scene- a baby tries to make a turtle drown in a small pond, and through the baby's perspective you get an underwater shot of the turtle wading, almost flying around like there's no worry in the world. You may just hear laughter at some point in the film - maybe of a child or maybe even your own - but it's a laughter wrapped with a palpable sense of danger. Watch the film if you can watch turtles fly in spite of broken limbs. ]"
623,"[The commonly believed theory that adaptations of books don't really turn out into good films, will come in for a reality check, if we dig deeper into the sheer amount of regional literature that has successfully been adapted for screen. I've salivated much over Satyajit Ray's debut film Pather Panchali (adapted from Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's novel). I spent last week admiring another of Ray's gems - Pratidwandi, this one based on a novel by Sunil Ganguli.Part of Satyajit Ray's Calcutta Trilogy - Seemabaddha (Company Limited) and Jana Aranya (The Middleman) being the other two that followed - this film is wonderful chronicle of Calcutta of the 1970s, through the eyes of an unemployed intellectual, Siddhartha (Dhritiman Chatterjee), who is a college drop-out and struggling to find a job. The film beautifully captures his frustrations, insecurities, the ideals he clings to, even as people around him seem to slowly find a footing as 'doers, not thinkers'.Ray also shows a grasp over the changing gender equation of those times, where it was observed that qualified (and let's say attractive) women would find a job quite easily than men. Siddhartha's sister, Sutapa (Krishna Bose) represents that shift, and is shown not only to be earning a modest salary, but also is slated for a fat pay-hike, wants to pursue modelling and has enrolled for ballet classes. Siddhartha's amazement at this gender shift - ""Didi, you've changed a lot"" - is well documented.Ray's cinematic technique is one of the highlights of this film. The influence of French New Wave cinema is evident thanks to the frequent jump-cuts, stylish visual metaphors and impulsive dream sequences. All of them not add some chutzpah to the storytelling, but also put together a diverse assortment of thoughts inside Siddhartha's brain. I especially liked the way his mind is transported to a certain Biology class, when he sees a woman crossing the street.The character of Siddhartha is essentially the soul of the film and his insecurities are such that viewers can easily relate to. His predicament of finding a job is shown to be a rather painful process. The interview screening scenes are tributes to Ermanno Olmi's gem The Job (1961), and right from the nervous interviewee biting his fingernails, to the lack of seating arrangements, the screenplay does justice to depict the anxiety of the intellectual Bengali struggler in the 1970s. A highlight is Siddhartha's job interview scene - his answers set the tone for what is to follow in the course of the film.I loved the way Ray has used close-ups in the film. Siddhartha's calm plea for silence when he feels he's being lectured at, his desire to shoot his enemy at sight, his transformation into a revolutionary in a second, his scorn for the rich and wealthy, and his disgust for foreigners high on dope, are acute observations that define his nature. These are little moments, but they add great value to character development.Siddhartha's own search for a worthy job runs parallel to his search for a bird, from his childhood memories. The film does well to tie the two searches together, till the end.Although set in the Calcutta of the 1960s, Pratidwandi continues to be relevant considering the city's current state of affairs. Employment is still a major issue. I can tell you from personal experience, that the quiet and composed Bengali 'intellectual' that Siddhartha personifies in the film, still is a topic of playful mockery and often runs the risk of sounding too frank and candid about his loyalties and preferences, when he appears for job interviews.Pratidwandi is certainly one of Ray's best works. I'm not sure if it's a DVD which you'll revisit again and again, unless for academic purposes. Nevertheless, it's a fine story about ideals being compromised under pressure from reality. Watch it not just for Satyajit Ray, but also to get an easy understanding of the mind of a struggler, stuck in a Leftist state where opportunities are few, but to embrace them, something has to give - soul, ideals or temper.]"
624,"[I love cinema that can be discussed like a Maths question paper after coming out of the examination hall. Where participants / viewers can compare mental notes. Questions like ""What do you think happened to him?"", ""Why did he do that?"", ""Where did he come from?"" It gives the film the much needed mind-space to exist beyond its stipulated running time.The Return is a film in a similar genre. By not making details about the central character's background explicitly clear, director Zvyagintsev heightens the mystery in this thriller to enormous proportions, and solves itself only partially by the end of the film. However, unlike most mysteries, this one has got no scam, murder or robbery connected to it.Somewhere in Russia, two young boys - Andrei (Vladimir) and Ivan (Ivan) - are shocked to discover one day that their father, who they believed was no more, has suddenly come home. We're not told where the father (Konstantin) was, all this while. The mother doesn't explain, nor do the boys get any answers from the man himself. Even as the two of them jump at the idea of an extended fishing trip that the father proposes, they can only hope that they get to know him better.I haven't seen a film like this, before. The film is intense, brooding and eerie throughout. You're left guessing whether the father is a ghost, a dictator or a stranger bent on using the kids to further his own means. Why did he suddenly propose the fishing trip? Where is he taking them? Does he want his boys to turn into men? Why doesn't he tell them where he was all this while? These are questions that keep crossing your mind throughout. Interestingly, these are the same questions that are troubling the two boys as well and making difficult for them to trust the man completely. If you look deeper, Ivan and Andrei represent two faces of a human mind when faced with a mystery - the former is questioning and rebellious, while the latter more easily accepting of things the way they are.There are times when you place yourself in the father's shoes and realise you can't blame him for the way he is. He's been absconding for 12 years. He's not even familiar with the world of his two boys - what are their likes, dislikes. Scenes where he asks Andrei to settle the  bill at a restaurant, or shows them how to get the car wheel out of muddy track, or how to punch a guy who robbed the two of their money - all point towards him wanting his sons to stand up on their feet and defend themselves. In a way, you can never fully convince yourself that the father is a villain in the film because everytime you feel so, he tops it up with something that makes him endearing. It heightens the mystery about the back-story of the father.The irony of the screenplay - and this is the film's biggest strength which fuels the suspense - is the mood of the three characters during the trip. Here they are, going on a fishing trail through the beautiful countryside. But there's very little they speak with each other. The photography captures their mood perfectly, lending itself beautifully to the film's cheerless feel. The director shows a particular fascination for landscapes, especially water, and you'll know why, when you see the film.The climax is breathtaking and easily the biggest highlight of the film. The shock, and the character's reaction to the shock and what follows after, left me with sweaty palms. The closing sequence (a fond tribute to that of The Motorcyle Diaries), seals the films and beautifully, it left me immensely satisfied.I loved Ivan's performance in the film. Despite being a child actor, he is the perfect nemesis for his father. Shot mostly through close-ups, he is the most well-written character in the film, after his father. Konstantin fits the role to a T and his tall, lean figure and athletic build point to the character's history somewhere in military Russia.I can only imagine what a high it must have been to discover this film at a film festival. The film is made of stuff that can make you smile in satisfaction for the discovery of a fine, new directorial voice from Russia. An outstanding debut, by all measures.]"
625,"[I'm a fan of subtlety. I like gestures which say a lot without a word being exchanged. Where you-say-it-best-when-you-say-nothing-at-all. I love the sound that silence brings with it. Which is why, I think I liked Majid Majidi's Baran. The film is a romance that is an accomplishment in exercising restraint, where the bond between the two young characters in question, is never explicitly declared. You never know if its love, or infatuation, or just sympathy, a longing, or curiosity to engage with each other in a country where men and women can never be 'friends'. Where, if the two characters had Facebook accounts, their relationship statuses would read: ""It's complicated beyond the understanding of Zuckerberg's algorithm.""And the complications are simple to understand. At a construction site in Tehran, 17-year, chiselled face Lateef is as hot-tempered as the tea he prepares for the workers. He picks up a fight at the drop of a hat, but his life takes a turn in unimaginable ways when his Afghan co-worker gets injured and sends his young son Rahmat, as a replacement.This is Majidi gold, to be honest, part of an envious roster he churned out in his career - Children of Heaven, Pedar, Colours of Paradise, The Song of Sparrows. Unlike these films, Baran doesn't exactly tug at your heartstrings or make you cry. Instead, it leaves you pondering about the lengths to which man's behaviour is influenced in the presence of a woman. Especially a woman he feels an attraction for.Young actor Hussain Abedini plays that young man to perfection and the camera captures his transformation from 'angry youngster to samaritan' beautifully. Majidi's focus on the goodness of human beings continues in this film as well. The villians (as expected, considering the sanctions on Majidi's work in Iran) are the government officials, who are clamping down on the employment of Afghani refugees in Iran. Mohd. Aamir Naji, a Majidi regular, is able to bring to life the desperation of the construction site boss, Memar. He is a do-gooder, employing the needy Afghans, bailing out Lateef in times of crisis and when he loses his temper, his agony is understandable.The characters are fleshed out well, as is the mystery around Rahmat (Zahra Bahrami, in her only film appearance). With puffy, emotive eyes, Rahmat is the big surprise that the film offers and Majidi's unveiling of that surprise is one of the most beautifully filmed scenes in the film.Beauty, in fact, is something Majidi is consistent with. For example, his fascination with pigeons to illustrate a frame. He also continues his obsession with water, as you will discover by the end of this film. In a way, water has been therapeutic to his work. What cannot be judged by man, is judged by the calm or fluidity of water.Despite being a slow film - the last 30 minutes are a bit of a struggle - it does well to capture every man's reality: it takes a woman to make us good human beings. A mother from birth, and a wife in adulthood. Lateef doesn't have any of them - which possibly explains his meandering ways - but when faced with a woman in his life, he does come around to changing himself.The closing shot of this film figures in my top 10 closing shots in films. Incidentally, Majidi's other films also figure in that list. He's clearly a master finisher. He keeps things abstract, in a way that you go home feeling comfortable with his verdict.Baran is a romance like none other. The lovers never even come close to touching each other, or brushing fingers, for that matter. But in such restraint, lies the magic of it all. They don't call it 'Majidi magic' for no reason.]"
626,"[A hard-core, hot-headed, cold-blooded criminal has a past that resurfaces in unknown ways. It surprises him too by showing him his fuzzy, warm side. In the ""opposite attracts"" sense, it feels natural that another person's purity will amuse him and eventually draw him to the person. And all of this is played out well too. It is very clear that the story writer's focus is on the main character, Shivam (Emraan Hashmi). There is no attempt to talk about the other characters. They are a given, a fact that you can accept or reject - your call. Similarly the couple coincidences in the main plot are difficult to digest but they are presented in a very matter-of-factly manner - take it or leave it - the writer couldn't care less. There is an attempt to make characters more interesting. For example, Malik (Ashutosh Rana) is a person who takes pride in the fact that he is good at judging people and their motivations, but is it true all the time? How will he take it? Good thought for the audience to chew on, but it is not addressed satisfactorily. Such character developments are not given the strong conclusion that the set-up deserved. Very rarely does a Hindi movie build the whole story around just one character and sticks to that. No back story for the villain, the side-kick, the lead lady -  nothing!  While that hurts a little bit, at least my usual objection to the mixing of genres is held at bay. The focus on Shivam makes the character study at least that much more interesting. The product becomes worth the watch as the story of Shivam. The writer's implied arrogance however is easily forgiven, due to the justice done to Shivam's stylization and the depth in which his character has been portrayed. All of which would have been lost, had Emraan Hashmi not been composed and restrained in his performance. Be it as a romancer of the lady, the action-master gangster, the loner, or the loser who is looking for a meaning to his life. I just wish something could be done with his voice. (Or have they done it already? I don't remember his voice being so jarring and whimpy in his more recent films.) The other person who really impressed with his performance is Purab Kohli playing the madcap goon who thinks he owns the world. It took me a while to recognize him. This was more because of his act rather than his make-up. On the other hand the women do nothing to evoke any emotion. It'd be unfair to blame them because the writing doesn't do justice to their characters. One is to plain vanilla, the other is in the most difficult situation a  woman could find herself in but the one scene that shows you the gravity of the situation comes way too late. Sure, the first scene does tell us about her situation, but it isn't followed up. The next scene shows her in the lap of luxury. It feels like a major continuity glitch in the writing, like they forgot to write a couple of scenes. The introductory scenes in Mohit Suri's films are both impressive and disappointing. They have a CSI episode kind of an expose only the build up here is not half as exciting. That's because, the basic plot of a criminal seeking redemption has done the rounds often enough. They try to add a little depth by including a family feud and the chaos an efficient outsider's (Shivam's) presence can do in an already tense situation. But, it goes nowhere and ultimately falls flat on the face. The filmmakers allude to spirituality and existentialism throughout the film. Afterall you have a monster trying to become the Buddha. If only they had done so with more conviction and didn't have to succumb to out-of-context song and dance. It's a slow, serious film. And though it tries hard, it's not subtle.Note: I saw this film on Satellite TV.]"
627,"[World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles is a painful action movie to sit through. One of those films which makes you despair for worthy newcomers in the industry - great scripts which find no producers - and instead go into mindless special effects bonanzas like this one, all in the name of a science fiction film. Trouble is, the film takes itself seriously and you begin to look for the Exit sign in the theatre.The film is nothing but a 2-hour long action sequence, shot in a manner which Barkha Dutt's cameraman would have shot the Kargil War: running, ducking from bombs and lasers, with absolutely no aesthetics to photography and no reason for slow motion. Some may argue that it takes the viewer in the centre of the action - and believe me it does, some laser bullets feel like they're coming through the screen - but why would I want to be amongst a bunch of characters who adhere to the most terrible cliches of American film casting (an Asian, an African, a Latin American, etc) and possess nothing interesting to boast of, not even a sense of humour.The dialogue in the film is mostly incomprehensible - the most common ones being ""Move!! Move!! Move!!"", 'Watch out!!"". I get the feeling that the sound design artist, responsible for creating sounds of gunshots and bomb explosions, must have charged - you guessed it right - a bomb. Action overcomes everything else in this film, which doesn't even make a lame attempt at explaining logic.Americans are known to be proud of their Armed forces - the Marines - and this film is another attempt at glorifying their role in the middle of any crisis. When the world is suddenly faced with an alien invasion, Captain Nantz (Aaron Eckhart, in a solid performance) and his platoon do everything they can to save a bunch of civilians in Santa Monica, even as major cities across the world attacked by a meteor shower that brings along aliens. Any sense into the whys and hows of the invasion is made clear by edgy news reports - some say it is a colonization, some say they're here for our water. All this could have been depicted through a new character of a scientist/expert on these things, but director Jonathan Liebesman (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Darkness Falls) and writer Christopher Bertolini (The General's Daughter) decide to skip all such formalities and focus only on the platoon instead. The result is a film where the characters are just shooting aliens, and some more aliens and some more.Alien invasion films got a new life a couple of years back, when Peter Jackson produced District 9 - it was classy, made globally significant statements about colonization, evacuation and humanity, all in CNN-style again. But it managed to touch a chord somewhere, through more developed characterisation and the docu-drama feel. It was so much more believable. Heck, even the aliens looked better designed. Which means, there's always a way to make an alien invasion movie interesting. Apocalypse itself is a great theme to draw people into theatres (2012 was a huge success in India and Rolland Emerich continues to make movies on the same theme) - we all want to indulge in that one scary fantasy of how it would feel like to see the world come to an end. Despite being done to death, the success of District 9 showed that aliens still continue to fascinate us, provided there are interesting characters and there's finesse involved in their making. World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles could have won some brownie points had it tried telling the story through the eyes of the civilians - that way, we'd have got a sense of why Americans love the Marines so much. We don't know what aliens look like, but why not add some quirks to their character design? This film's aliens look plain ugly, as do their spaceships and it becomes apparent that not too much time and thought has been spent on them.This special effects film looks good when it begins - the overhead shots of the coastline under attack looks breathtaking, but after a point the novelty of all those explosions wears off and you're just waiting for the film to end. So I'm at my sarcastic best when I say that it's a great movie to go for, on a date. The theatres will be empty.]"
628,"[Darren Aronofsky, the director of films like Pi, Requiem For A Dream, The Wrestler has achieved the almost perfect film with Black Swan. The flaws, even if there are any, do not seem obvious and attempts to find any, are equivalent to finding a needle in a haystack.Based on the character of ballerina Nina, who in her quest for perfection, soon begins to lose her mind trying to play the coveted central roles in a ballet, this film is a gripping psychological thriller, from start to finish. In the process, the director visits the human body's fragility yet again, as he did in his previous films (Requiem For A Dream dealt with the body succumbing to drug abuse, The Wrestler dealt with a fighter's body). Aronofsky gives life to the unforgettable character of Nina, played out by a devoted Natalie Portman, a role the actress' contemporaries would kill for.Aronofsky begins the film very much like a docu-drama, the camera following Nina's character closely - a style he has polished over his previous films. I still can't stop marvelling at how little time it took him to establish Nina's character, shed a tear or two on her selection in the ballet, cringe every time she peeled off dead skin off her fingers and toes, nurse a wound on her cracked toenails. Graphic, disturbing and gory. After you've been wowed by Nina's condition and the director's setup, the supporting cast takes over - Lily (Mila Kunis), Nina's sensuous, carefree nemesis; Thomas (Vincent Cassell) her promiscuous instructor and Nina's mother (Barbara Hershey), a former ballerina herself.The film largely centres around Nina and Lily - one charming and graceful, and the other, who has no qualms in letting go and losing herself. Ironically, those are just the qualities Nina is required to portray in her opera performance, a challenge she becomes obsessed at perfecting. Portman's year long training and dedication towards her role, are totally Oscar-worthy and I'm glad that it's at least the one choice that is unanimous.Jealousy, competition, regret, pushing the limits, fantasy - are the major threads the screenplay weaves in. But the biggest thread is that of obsession. I've seen people being obsessed with their looks, with their Blackberry phones or about handbags, but an artist's obsession with perfection is something else, because it is something you work towards, laboriously. Especially, for a role so challenging, where you are required to transition from the good guy to the bad guy, flawlessly. Portman's premise that is entirely believable, sympathetic and tragic.And while this is happening, two parallel stories - that of Nina and Swan Lake - seem to switch sides. In her quest to perfect the character of Black Swan, Nina increasingly finds herself internalising that creature, thanks to her relationship with Lily. She becomes like an ugly duckling, rebellious and bold and meanwhile, the same character in Swan Lake longs to become like Nina's earlier self, the White Swan - pure, attractive and controlled. Redemption happens, but on a side where you do not expect. What makes the transition so fluid, is some consistently well-choreographed hand-held photography by Mathew Libatique. I used the word 'choreographed' because I realised the camera movement during the opera, was as graceful and on a tiptoe as every ballerina performing. That, accompanied with Clint Mansell's original background score, elevate the film to new highs. The climax is a through-and-through goosebump-cum-wow sequence, riddled with twists and surprises. You're left guessing, what next and when it all comes to an end, you murmur, ""Oh my God."" I did, and I stuck, sinking myself into the film even after it was over. To borrow a phrase from Navjyot Sidhu, Black Swan hit me like a tracer bullet. There are good films and there are bad films. And there are films which are in a league of their own, surpassing our expectations of the medium. Darren Aronofsky has made one such film.  ]"
629,"[You know those lists newspapers recommend during Teacher's Day? 'Films based on the role of teachers', etc., where they will mention films such as To Sir With Love, Black, Karate Kid, etc. Well, add a new film to that list - em&gt;The King's Speech. It's a heartwarming, feel-good movie about a king resorting to an ordinary man's help to overcome a speech disability, so that he can deliver an important speech to his countrymen.It's what I call the 'pure gentleman's film', steeped in British royalty, since it concerns the Duke of York (Colin Firth in an Oscar winning performance) and Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter, the most gentle, kind and determined wife). Right from the background score, to the sets, to the wry humor about knighthood, to the psychological divide between the royalty and the masses - it is the most typically British film, I've seen in recent times. (The Queen was the last gem, that comes to mind.)The film works because of its performances, witty writing and the character improvisations. Colin Firth is outstanding, as is his speech therapist, Lionel (played by Geoffrey Rush). On paper, Lionel's character is certainly far more interesting and this is established in scenes where the screenplay allows him to stand his ground and treat the Duke as a student / patient, than as royalty with whom he needs to watch his manners.Writer David Seidler uses Lionel not only to transform the Duke into a deserving King who can speak his mind, but also to make subtle commentary about the ridiculous customs of the monarchy, its values which have now outstayed their welcome in the 21st Century. The most remarkable quality about his writing is that despite being based on a true story during the World War, Lionel's approach at dealing with the royalty seems extremely contemporary, rooted in the current times.A special word about cinematographer Danny Cohen's characteristic wide angles used consistently throughout the film. And that special word is, marvellous. It's spectacular how the camerawork adapts to the Duke's speech correction - at the beginning, the wide angles almost bloat up his head every time he is facing the camera, a sign that he is losing his mind, in frustration of his stammering habit exposed to the public. As he embraces Lionel's controversial methods of treatment, the wide angles slowly disappear and you begin to see a King, chin up.It is Colin Firth's film, throughout. He is as convincing as a cat that has caught its tongue, and his transition from an embarrassed, nervous wreck, to a man who forges a bond with Lionel and becomes worthy of ownership of his throne, is classic. Mid-way through the film, I thanked my stars (and my tongue) because the realisation dawned that speech, oratory skills and language have been at the core of the greatest resistances and revolutions in history. And they continue to do so.The King's Speech is undoubtedly a great film, but I do not think it is something you HAVE to watch on the big screen. I usually prefer films that do not require me to pause crunching my popcorn, just so that I have to hear the dialogue clearly. A deserving big screen watch is a film with some element of action, music, adventure or fantasy, that makes the experience immersive. The King's Speech, largely filmed indoors, doesn't present any of those attributes - and therefore, in my view, does not command compulsive viewing in theatres, especially not in near-empty ones its playing at, in the on-going World Cup season. I suspect the original DVD may release soon - banking on the Oscar acclaim - and you could have a far more holistic experience, rounding it up with the behind the scenes and how-did-you-pull-it-off interviews with Colin Firth.But before I conclude, I must address a crucial question: Did this film deserve the epitome of Oscar glory this year? My answer is a firm no. Not because it is not a good film - it raises many a chuckle, mostly tongue-in-cheek, but never a WOW.  The Social Network, Inception, Black Swan are some films that do make us go WOW, and on many occasions even make us cringe in our seats, shield our eyes and most importantly, forget that there's popcorn and Coke on the armrest. That's immersive, in the true sense.]"
630,"[The Ramayana has been re-told and re-depicted countless times. I first heard of the story of Ram and Sita through my Grandmother, and back then it was a pretty straight one - a flat, legendary epic about morals and bravery. Most of us try to retain the tale as it is, which is why we have Ram-Leela and innumerable theatrical versions of The Ramayana, and I'm sure when I tell the story to my children, I won't change it one bit. Sita Sings the Blues, on the other hand, celebrates the watered down versions of the Ramayana, as we know it now in the 2000s, in the most colourful, polychromatic manner possible.  Nina Paley's Sita Sings the Blues is not just an animated version of The Ramayana. It incorporates multiple narratives of the same story, told in different settings and tones. The primary narrative is the epic tragedy - conveyed by animating static paintings/photographs of Sita, Rama, Ravana and Hanuman, which is backed with a morally serious voiceover.  This narrative serves the educational purpose of the film, using the traditional dramatic style of story telling. It sets it apart from the musical episodes of the Ramayana, which uses a more comfortable and digital animation. These episodes include jazz vocals of the 1920s by Annette Hanshaw, suggestively trying to imply a convergence between musical entertainment and tradition - also because story telling for us has now become just that. Sita sings the blues in this narrative to tell us her story. The most endearingly ironical parts of the movie are the two parallel narratives, which run alongside this vibrant play of characters. The first one uses shadow puppet animation, voiced by 3 Indians who seem to know only bits and pieces of the Ramayana, recite the tale in an urban and confused manner. One can relate to their recitation mostly because the language is colloquial, the facts are half-baked and derived by searching deep into those memories that have been passed down from generation to generation of every Indian home. It's endearing because any of those voices could easily be me - and that is a striking vision on the director, Paley's part. All of these multiple variations of the story are interspersed with a modern-day autobiographical account of a married couple (Nina and her husband) living in San Francisco, who face turbulences because the husband leaves for work to Trivandum. The animation is like a pencil cartoon, and the idea is to relate this with the sacred story only to contrast it with current day happenings. While on one hand, you have devotion and everlasting love between Sita and Ram, you also have an American couple that stands on the absolute other end of the spectrum. The DVD of Sita Sings the Blues also has a collection of the movie's soundtrack - which is absolutely charming. Get hold of the DVD to learn more about Annette Hanshaw and for an audio interview with Nina Paley, where she discusses how the idea came to her, and more about her autobiographical story in the film.Sita Sings the Blues is an absolute deconstruction of conventional story-telling customs, which served one purpose and had one linear story. These parallel narratives whirlpool into one basic idea - In how many different ways can you tell the same story?  Each narrative uses different animation, a different tone - be it musical, modern or epic and they all come together to endorse plurality. It's a plurality of understanding, plurality of ideas and plurality of existence. ]"
631,"[Y Tu Mama Tambien (And Your Mother Too) is a Spanish phrase, often used in response to a cuss word hurled at you. The film will never release in India and even if it does release on DVD, significant portions of the film will get the censors' axe. (I rented the International edition...geez!). I wouldn't call it soft porn - it's in fact one notch higher. That said, I must say, its a good film, with some big names in world cinema attached to it. Directed by Alfonso Cuaron (he made Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and produced Pan's Labyrinth), this film stars one of my favourite Spanish actors Gael Garcia Bernal (The Motorcycle Diaries, Amores Perros, Babel), along with Maribel Verdu (Milk) and Ana Lopez Mercado (Pan's Labyrinth).Bernal (Julio) and Verdu (Tenoch) play very close teenage buddies, who at a wedding, court Ana (Luisa) and casually propose a road-trip to a beach, hoping she would bite the bait. When Luisa really does, the trio embark on a journey that makes them discover new shades not only about each other's pasts, but about life in general.The film's genre, a road trip, lends itself to easy viewing - thanks to humour, scenic locales, picturesque, agile photography. The purpose of the trip and the key take-away from it, is what takes this film a notch higher. Due credit for that goes to Cuaron's screenplay. The interplay of the dialogues and the narrator's voice-over mix very well and provide a longer shelf-life to the characters.I frankly thought there's too much sex in the film and after a point all that the three are discussing is sex, how they do it, who they did it with and how it was. Sure, there's a purpose to all those talks and although not all of it is titillating, I'm a huge supporter of subtlety and I'd prefer that a film-maker use semiotics and his own creativity to interpret such sexual energy.  Cuaron's style is more like, 'This is how it happened. I don't want to hide anything'.One of the strong points of the film, is the manner in which Cuaron depicts life outside their car. An accident on the highway, a bride's family asking for alms, political unrest, regular police patrolling, a beggar entering a restaurant to ask for alms - each of them are beautiful reminders that although the trio may be on a dream road trip, but eventually, they will have to return to the big, bad ugly world. Shades of that ugly world - the character's histories, some cloaked in lies, appear intermittently throughout the film, resulting in tears, agony and arguments. Each of them are fantastic allegories of bumps on the highway. You slow down for a moment, but eventually you move on.I loved every actor's performance in the film. Both Bernal and Verdu are intense, jovial and brooding. They've done their nude scenes with enormous confidence and their camaraderie shows. Ana is graceful, bold and mysterious and the one force that keeps the three together. Her character, as you learn by the end of the film, is the only thing that saves the film from becoming just a film about a journey.Watch this film with a mature bunch of people - those who appreciate cinema and do not start giggling or gasping at bold love making scenes.]"
632,"[Yeh Faasley's first hour is one of those in which you'd want to walk out of the theater. Like that of a badly made B-grade film. The excessively grainy texture doesn't add any fun either. It is way too distracting. But then, the actual plot starts unfolding and man is it a thrilling ride! It's not just the surprises; the psychological element that the story carries is one mind-bending process. In fact, it is one example of how even a straightforward, linear narrative can take a fair share of your brainpower. After leaving the theater, you go back and forth between why Dev (Anupam Kher) behaved the way he did. It also adds some insight into why Arunima (Tena Desae) who thinks her father killed her mother would still want to bond with her dad. Like anyone in love, she wants to hold on to the last thread of hope, which will keep her from hating her father she once loved. ""Why did he kill her? Is he the man she thinks he is? Was there no love at all between them? Did he kill her at all?"" These are the questions Arunima pulls you into, when you were half-ready to leave the theater. You didn't only because of your respect for Anupam Kher. And while he doesn't let you down, we know he could have done so much more with the scene in which he breaks down. Instead, there is a plain voiceover narrating the emotions. Such a shame. These are decisions for which the director has to take complete blame. Also, the courtroom drama ...actually can't be called drama because it is rather blah considering how smartly and subtly the psychological part of the plot is played out. The screenplay also doesn't support the story in terms of consistent pace. The set-up is boring and takes too much screen-time. The actual action starts much later and has very little time to play itself out. Yeh Faasley's story at its core is beyond awesome. I'd have loved to see what a different director and another screenplay writer would have done with it. Oh well, at least they didn't mess the way it turns out in the end. The psychological nuances and motivations explain everything.Off late, with any movie that I've started to like at any point, I dread the climax - it invariably is butchered by awful writing for the climax or commercial needs. Yeh Faasley is the other way round. The climax is just perfect!]"
633,"[You know something is wrong between a married couple when both of them don't share the same bed anymore. When they don't make their rift apparent in front of their daughter, you know that the only thing that's holding them together is the happiness of the little girl, who neither of them would want to see grow up between parents living apart.Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Mitchelle Williams) are such a couple and their mundane life in the countryside is devoid of any colour that comes with the term 'happily married'. Dean paints houses for a living, while Cindy is a doctor. Blue Valentine is the story of their falling out of love, while reflecting upon the story of their falling in love.From the first shot itself, the camera establishes their rift with ease, as it desperately tries to capture some eye contact between the two, but finds none. It becomes very clear that for Cindy, Dean doesn't exist. She wants him to do something worthwhile, not opt to continue as a painter, a job which allows him to drink beer early morning. Dean thinks its okay, because that's a job that keeps him happy. That's essentially the source of  the rift - one partner wanting the other person to 'be' someone else and not accepting him the way he is. It doesn't drive her to forge an extra-marital affair, but it doesn't show her wanting to make an extra effort to make things work either. Cindy appears to be suffering silently. And despite Dean trying hard to make things work - he finds himself losing control of himself, and their marriage.The story of their falling in love is a beautiful one and that alone is what makes their separation a little unbearable for the viewers. There is a beautiful sequence of Dean wooing Cindy, asking her to tap-dance to his music and it is one of my most lasting impressions of the film. Some scenes are so tragic, I ended up shielding my eyes. And it felt gut-wrenching because the screenplay so beautifully establishes the two characters and stitches their two tracks together - the love story and the falling out of it.What disappointed me though, was that the film never made it clear when exactly the tensions between the two began. Was there an incident that sparked off the descent? Did Dean give up a well-paying job offer to settle for his current artistic endeavour? You don't find answers to these questions. You're convinced however, that he is a good father, as she is a good mother.The film subtly makes a point about how well a child's existence can act as a lever to balance a rocky relationship. A child is always a reminder of the passion that brought two lovers together. But Frankie (their daughter) isn't an ordinary child. And when you see the film, you'll know why Dean is no ordinary lover, despite Cindy's declining interest for him. Blue Valentine is memorable thanks to Ryan Gosling's and Mitchelle Williams' performances. They've enacted their pre-marriage romance and the post-marriage cold vibes so well, your heart reaches out to them, mourning the fall of their relationship. Both won deserving nominations for Best Actor and Actress at the Golden Globes. What I'm sure of, is that you'll find this film a memorable one. Especially married couples. Director Derek Cianfrance has made an outstanding feature film debut with this one. You'll enjoy listening to him in the interview that's the only Special Feature on this DVD.]"
634,"[""If only..."", ""Just this..."" and then I'll be happy ever after. Until I come with my next ""if only...""Sirf is based on this very human aspect restricting itself to the man-woman relationship. Now if only, it had been just a little better in its execution. Or maybe it only needed to be just a little shorter. Sirf uses four couples from different income strata and age groups to display the strife that every couple may go through each phase in a relationship. While the premise is interesting and is held together by a decent enough story, the events are narrated very plainly and the story falls apart in the end. Everyday problems have improbable closures. Sirf takes a good 40-50 minutes to introduce you to all the eight main characters. It starts out with the problems that could be very similar to ones you and I or someone we know closely has faced. That should mean we identify with the characters, but strangely we don't. It just feels like you are listening to a not-so-close friend ramble on about her problems and you are trying your best to at least look interested. And by the time the stage is set things take unconvincing turns and the story gets out of hands for you to get any more interested than you originally were...not. And beyond the story, there's nothing much to appreciate. I can understand the lack of choice in terms of actors due to budget constraints. But my complaint is against the director not utilizing what he already had on board. At least four out of the eight actors are known for their performances - Kay Kay Menon, Ranvir Shorey, Sonali Kulkarni, and Parvin Dabas - yet you don't identify or sympathize with any of them. Also, the rest of the cast starts out really well and make you believe you just might be in for a treat, but na-a-ah. In fact, Rituparna Sengupta suddenly turns from a serious character into comic relief. You just don't know where to look when she goes into her most-annoying, supposedly-funny crying bout. It's not that the writer/director hasn't tried. He tries in terms of connecting the four stories and he tries to add layers too. For example, I really liked how he tries to show what the younger couple is learning from the more experienced ones. I appreciate the attempt in trying to balance all things good and bad about urbania. But then, that has been done before, it could very well have been left behind. In trying to do too much, nothing is achieved.That is the main undoing. Sirf doesn't have focus. It doesn't know whether it wants to be serious or have comedy. It doesn't know whether it wants to make its point or have the commercial material fit in somehow (example: misplaced songs which are lackluster so they don't serve that purpose anyway). At the end of the 2-plus hours, I was in two minds too. Whether to spend more time on the film in writing this review or not. Sense of duty beckoned. I watched this film on satellite TV.]"
635,"[Remember Saajan? And the dozen other films which had a struggle going on between two male leads who love the same woman? They'd play badminton and she'd be the shuttlecock? I hated the supposed large-heartedness of one friend 'sacrificing' the girl for/to his friend, as if she has no say in who she is in love with. In Tanu weds Manu our lady, Tanu has a fully-installed brain. Unfortunately, it's malfunctioning or maybe her heart is not in-sync because she is still the shuttlecock. Only this time, it's of the lady's own doing. Yet, it doesn't make the story any more interesting. At least, not the way it's written here. So what if the first 45 minutes of the film are as entertaining as they could ever be!? All's not well, if it doesn't end well, no? The movie starts with such crisp and witty dialogue (and perfect delivery by the actors) that everyone in the audience was laughing out loud at every alternate dialogue. Alternate dialogue only because the laughter from the earlier dialogue hadn't died down for us to hear the next one. Yep, even though I didn't hear half the dialogues in the first half, I was thoroughly entertained. All this I was still trying my best to get used to Kangna Ranaut as Tanu. Though, I don't think I ever settled down on that count. It was very difficult to shake away the question - what if someone else was playing the loud, boisterous, small-town girl who doesn't know what to do with all the male attention she gets. While, Kangna just about passes off in traditional Indian clothes and make-up, I just don't think she can carry long dialogues. Almost every dialogue comes across as if it were a tongue twister for her. While she deserves all marks for trying something out of her comfort zone, some of the lines given to her are wasted because she doesn't fit the bill. On the other hand Madhavan perfectly wears the shoes of an NRI who is on his 'girl-seeing' trip to India - unsure, sticking out, and embarrassed by all the mollycoddling. But this act along with his spinelessness loses charm soon enough and becomes repetitive. The rest of the characters are marginally interesting, in fits and starts. That's because they just didn't get any attention from the writer; else, they had potential to capture yours. This is sad because I was sitting amongst a crowd that cheered Ravi Kissen and Deepak Dobriyal in their first scenes. Sure, the main characters are written in detail, but the plot fails. You barely care for Tanu. The character that she is, you don't think she deserves all that she wants out of life. She is so oblivious to the ruckus she's causing in others' lives. And the specimen of nature that Manu is you want him to get Tanu, only because that's what he wants; you know it's not the best thing for him. These are interesting things, because the protagonists are grey characters, but somehow it all looks half-cooked. Also there is a lot happening in the film other than the superficial. You have one Che Guevara worshipper who is doing things just to be labeled a rebel. While the other one with a Guevara poster in his room propagates a value system that makes you do things just so your parents are happy. The latter gives an inch because he's nice and the people around him take an ell and more. They either meddle and manage his life or misuse his kindness. This is only a scratch on the surface of this generation's struggle - be nice and misused OR use and be nasty. At the same time, Tanu weds Manu tries to show how the definition of love is different for each person. At the macro level too, Tanu weds Manu tries to say a thing or two about the society and its changing equations. For example, the one between a bride and groom's side at an Indian wedding. And all this along with some awesome music that go completely with the tone of the film. Alas, the tone changes and the makers don't get that right.Just when the writing starts to lull, you are given a break with the interval. But the jokes dry up, the characters become serious and clueless. It's depressing to see the same writer who wrote such brilliant lines in the first hour or so regress to total boredom and write the most annoying climax a film could ever have. I started out thinking this is the Indies reply to YRF 'wedding' films and I ended up writing this review. ]"
636,"[I'm a sucker for films which are based in a claustrophobic setting; where the characters cannot escape. Something like being caught in the lift for two hours. Or, being locked inside a house. Confinement, entrapment bring about interesting layers in human character. Perhaps that's why I love prison dramas. 12 Angry Men is not a prison drama, it is rather a courtroom one. It doesn't unfold in a courtroom, rather it is set in a room where 12 jury members must determine collectively whether the accused is innocent or guilty of the charge of first degree murder. From the looks of it, it seems like an 'open and shut' case. You begin to wonder how you're going to sit through the next 90-odd minutes, if the case is so obvious.But Lumet's mastery kicks in early into the film and he drops clever signs of an impasse in store. A hot afternoon, no air-conditioning, a wall-fan which refuses to work and a room which has to be remain locked until a decision is arrived at - all these hinting at the dead-lock in store, the nerves about to fly and heated exchanges set to unravel. Half-way through the film, it begins to rain outside and by the time the film ends, so does the rain. That the director has kept in mind nature's background score, is impressive.My curiosity for this film piqued last month when I got my hands on to Lumet's book, Talking Movies where he describes how he used a specific set of lenses to shoot 12 Angry Men - lenses which would make the room appear much smaller than it actually is - thus adding to the claustrophobia. He gradually adjusted those lenses in such a way, that as the film progressed, the room appeared even smaller - adding to the tension. You cannot see the ceiling when the film begins, but you can towards the last 20-odd minutes of the film, suggesting that even the roofs are caving in on to the characters, almost in protest, begging for a decision to be arrived at. I didn't consciously notice these things while watching the film. But what I did feel was the rise in the adrenaline levels of the screenplay as the film progressed. Which means, each of Lumet's tricks behind the camera worked.In the process, the story touched upon some major issues - not just how the judicial system debates on a judgement, but also made a valid case for why it is so important to question the obvious. It becomes clear that being in doubt, questioning the facts again and again and not being prejudiced are the holy grail of decision making. When the jury convenes to debate the trial and what the verdict should be, there's only Juror No. 8 (Henry Fonda) who has a reasonable doubt of the accused being not guilty. The rest vote otherwise. As the film proceeds, his questioning zest spreads to other members in the room. Sparks fly and cans of prejudices are opened, as are empty heads filled with lack of interest and concern. The same jurors are caught wanting to swallow their own words.Each of the 12 jurors are interesting and unique in their own way. Hats off to screenwriter Regiland Rose for being able to seamlessly put to paper such different voices from the same pen. There's an old experienced juror, an advertising executive, a man in a hurry to attend a baseball game, an adamant self righteous juror unhappy about his teenager son, an old hag who thinks the verdict is too obvious to debate about, a suave gentleman who remains composed in expressing his point, a naive apprentice, and a man who belongs to the same community as of the accused. That's a diverse offering to place around a table.The film isn't just about whether the accused is guilty or not, it's rather about how much reasonable doubt does the existing evidence throw up. In cricket, we often refer to the term 'benefit of doubt'. In this film we realise why it's so important to consider even an iota of doubt and clear it out of the way. It could save an innocent's life.Lumet extracts great performances from the cast. Fonda is certainly good, but its Lee J Cobb who steals the show in being his nemesis. A courtroom drama looks like an uncool choice on a Sunday afternoon, but the actors have enough layers in them to keep you involved, engrossed with them in helping them solve the mystery. A noteworthy feature film debut, Mr Lumet! Despite nil special features on the DVD, except a booklet, this one has enough in it to warrant a 'must watch'. PS: Special mention to the Enlighten Home Library team for a very powerful DVD cover. Love the design!]"
637,"[So here comes another movie that is based on superpowers, mysterious aliens, and leaves scope for sequels. The title and the narration sound great, even though the trailer doesn't look very promising. John Smith (Alex Pettyfer) and others are being hunted down by Mogadorians, and he is fourth on the list. The action is really good. It is fast, opens the film brilliantly, and has special effects that I loved. Add to it the sound effects and it'll keep you on the edge of your seat. But these action scenes last for a very small duration. And the plot is so typical that it's depressing. The worn out terrain of good against evil has been moulded into a teenage story. The movie doesn't even focus on the alien-vs-alien-on-earth concept.The direction was a little disappointing too. I mean, people don't go to high school photography labs and make out when the bad guys are right behind! Cliches are used to the fullest - 'blending in' immediately translates to wearing the hood of a jacket. And John's guardian, Henri, has 4-6 computer screens only so that he can delete any pictures of John on the internet. There of course was a lot of unbelievable stuff mainly because it was executed very unconvincingly. Like say, what stone glows so bright blue in blazing sun? Dialogues have little punch and little taste. They concentrated more than necessary on the love story instead of plot development. No flashbacks, no villains histories, no heroic escapes were shown or even talked of. Plus there are no explanations to why things happen the way they are. And whatever little explanation is given is far from satisfying. For example, why are the 9 of them being hunted down, or why are the bad guys so bad? Let's hope they come up the explanations in the sequel. The love story is a boring teenage tragedy. One could easily fall asleep in that part. I should admit though, that the performances were surprisingly good. Okay, at least better than the Twilight Saga. Timothy Olyphant who plays John's guardian, Henri is worth a mention. Even if he is over protective, there is concern and passion in his eyes - something I believe is hard to do. Others are decent for amateurs.And like a friend said - the movie would definitely have sold better if it had been named 'I Am Number Six'. Teresa Palmer plays the hot, confident Number 6 who is also being hunted down, and watches John's back. Hot chick, hot action, hot bike. What else do you want?So if you want to get the best out of movie, watch the action, sleep through the high school drama.]"
638,"[I'm still digesting 7 Khoon Maaf. Bit-by-bit it's sinking in. Though I cannot say that I like it any better or worse, but the more I think about it, I certainly understand it that bit more. I'm sure my grasp of the film will only improve with a second or even third viewing. But, I don't think I can make myself watch it again for it's a tedious watch. The narrative is way too plain and predictable to hold my interest. This is largely made-up for by enigmatic Susanna, who is played out, breathtakingly by Priyanka Chopra. One of the main thoughts and images the film leaves behind is, the mystery that Susanna is. She scares you, but at the same time, she doesn't let you forget that your heart went out for her warmth, just an hour ago. You wanted to protect her, you still want to figure her out, you desperately look for her motivations that justify her whacky behavior - just so that you can continue liking her. Only to be greeted by a development that is crazier than anything you've seen thus far. The problem though is that you know how each of the episodes, each of her marriages is going to end. Of course, 7 Khoon Maaf is not meant to be a thriller. But, nothing is gripping about how or why the husband dies. And after the second one, the reason for marrying itself is dissatisfying. You begin to doubt if she did it just so that she could enjoy the how it would end. shudder Anyway, one of the culprits could also be the straightforward, linear narration. Also, way too often, the build-up falls flat. Now, given Vishal Bharadwaj's command over adapting novels to  films, I'll assume that the story itself didn't quite work for me. Reading Ruskin Bond's Susanna's Seven Husbands is on my to-do list now, just for a confirmation. It just wasn't detailed enough. For example, the side characters (Maggie, Khan, and Gunga) seem out-of-sync with the plot but their quirkiness has to be a part of the story. Not to mention that the performances (Usha Utthup, and two male leads (names, anyone?)) are extremely distracting too. I understand that Susanna and each of her husbands are eccentric too and thus quirky side-characters can find a home in their midst. But, the lack of rationale behind the three side-kicks' enthusiastic loyalty is confusing, if not disturbing. Fortunately, the rest of the performances are perfect. Also, there are some very powerful sequences. The manner in which Musafir's (Irrfan Khan's) idiosyncrasy is shot and executed, sticks way past the two and a half hours spent watching the film. The nervous laughter in the theater is a giveaway that Hindi film audience is not comfortable watching sexuality on screen. Not that our filmmakers have been too good sexual scenes either. And both filmmakers and the audience know the others' shortcoming. With this background, to not only show, but to also explicitly explain Musafir's need is as stunning as it is brave. And once you have overcome the shock, you are completely pulled into that chapter of the Susanna's life. Knowing for a fact that Vishal Bharadwaj films have something going on beyond the superficial, I tried to dig deeper. There's of course, the riddle that Susanna is and you can identify with her deterioration as a person. But save the fleeting references to the socio-political events and the climax, nothing looked like it had a larger purpose. Besides serving as a timeline, the events mentioned in the film might indicate our apathy to the society we live in. Which is why maybe Arun's wife (Konkona Sen Sharma) is hardly moved by Susanna's acts. To her it is just a fun story, till she gets affected by it personally. The climax and what it implies is sophisticated but is by no means a breath-stopper. Our Susanna has come of age but how she got there was too hard to comprehend.If you haven't figured it out yet, 7 Khoon Maaf is one of those films that I didn't enjoy watching at all, but it still leaves a good aftertaste. A film that I didn't like watching, but I liked. Yep, I'm still figuring it out. All I know right now, is this - it is heavy, weird and dark; as a breather it has awesome performances; AND it is a very difficult film to recommend.]"
639,"[Either you or someone really close to you has been a victim of patriarchal monarchy. That makes the first half of Patiala House so easy to identify with. But in vain because the second half is diametrically opposite. Patiala House goes all filmy on us, not that it's a surprise given the director's earlier ventures and that it is an Akshay Kumar film and that it is set in Punjab of the UK. Now there's a stereotype that justifies itself if there was one. And it is frustrating as a viewer.A well-established, decently-performed, smartly-edited, first hour sinks into mediocrity just as the characters are talking about trying to make most of their average lives. Here we start off with - - a brilliantly balanced view about racism, changing times, generation gaps, deep-rooted Indian culture, and its misgivings; - a pointer that each family has a a-la-Nirmala-from-Khoobsurat type strong and respected personality who keeps the family going and yet is the villain; - arguments for and against a characters and what made them the way they are;- a comment on human nature and how most of us are ready with a scapegoat to blame our failures on; - a woman's need to be a savior and how she invariably falls in love with the guy who she thinks needs her How and why, why, why does it change into ridiculously quick, or rather, convenient character transitions, lame situations, cliched resolutions, and a oh-not-so-fun walk towards the climax?? It barely looks like the same person wrote the remaining hour and a half. The standards set by this very industry make us expect a loud film whenever there are Punjabi characters, and with a name like Patiala House, there no room for doubt. But the silent first few minutes come as a lovely surprise. The grainy flashback interspersed with Parghat Singh Kahlon/Gattu's (Akshay Kumar) current life gives you hope of a good couple of hours ahead. This anticipation is met with a screenplay that sets up a good understanding between Parghat and his father, Bauji (Rishi Kapoor). Alongside, it also reinforces the equation that bauji has with his family and the larger community. It introduces you to and makes you comprehend his thought process. He was the one who stood up against racists. He was the one who brought dignity back to the community that was wronged. Of course, people respected him for what he had done. Of course, this fed his ego and he was proud that peopled followed his will like it was law. And of course, there was unrest. All this without a dialogue to that effect, just through performances. And yes, I had actually begun enjoying an Akshay Kumar film. I declare cricket to be the mantra! Patiala Househas done for Akshay Kumar what Chak De! did to Shah Rukh Khan and dare I say Lagaan did to Aamir Khan - bring out one of their best, if not THE best, performances thus far. It is pure joy to see a loud actor like Akshay Kumar play a meek guy and yet not make the character look like a buffoon. Equal credit to the writing and direction. How I wish he didn't break the bubble by slipping into Akki-mode every once in a while, especially the romantic moments. Fortunately, there weren't too many of those. His love interest, Simran (Anushka Sharma) is not the focus of the story. Her strong character knew when to step on the sidelines which also made her look inconsistent. But then again, the focus of the story was Bauji and not Simran, so who cares, right? Yet, Anushka certainly does her best to help Simran bring a smile and more from the audience. The lady has a screen presence that is rare even a part of it is owed to overacting - she is bright and refreshing. It might not stay fresh for too long if she continues to play the same type of a role again and again, though. Another woman who is just effective by her presence is Dimple Kapadia. With barely a couple of lines for her, she registers her silent protests. The rest of the cast is apt in being bitchy, resigned, cool, caricatured, confrontational, and so on. A reasonable variety of characters is on display only for the pack of cards to fall. I guess I'll just thank them for not doing the many things they could have done to go overboard in the last few minutes. Oh well. Anyway, with Valentine's Day coming up, you'd expect a romantic movie to be out this Friday. But, I guess, no popular holiday can replace the cricket world cup that begins next week. Unfortunately, Patiala House is a lame opening ceremony, especially with god-awful camerawork that captures the cricketing moments. Anyway, a half-good ceremony is only half-good (pliss to appreciate my attempt at inane commentary!)]"
640,"[Romanticizing the beauty of an old film is only natural. And what with Anand (Dev Anand) and Meeta (Sadhna) playing out their mute romance in all its cuteness. Somehow, the inexcusable delay in dialogue delivery for dramatic effect seems cute. You tend to discount the amateurish portrayal of emotions by trying to transport yourself to that era. You tend to think of the difficulties the makers might have gone through to shoot those war scenes, the double role, the depiction of Anand's internal struggle. In fact, you admire the film for these reasons.And along with that it makes its comment on the society that was then - the taboo associated with an unwed woman, let alone the hint at a live-in relationship; the futility of war and a philosophical question or two. kis liye jeete hain hum, kiss-ss ke liye jeete hain? baarahaa aise sawaalaat par rona aaya(what are we living for? Who are we living for?Repeatedly, one (the soul/we/I) cries at questions such as these)Those were the days of Sahir Ludhianvi. No metaphor, no simile, no pun - plain and simple poetry that makes its point. In just two lines he mocks all existential questions. And he does this with as much ease as he expresses that moment of separation between lovers even if it is just for a few hours. 'abhi na jaao chhod kar...' is there a couple who has heard this song and not referred to it. The playfulness of two people in love, the emotional blackmail, the moaning masked under that all-encompassing word 'LOVE' are all beautifully set to tune by Jaidev. adhuri aas chhod ke, adhuri pyaas chhod kejo roz yunhi jaaoge, to kis tarah nibhaoge?ki zindagi ki raah mein, jawaan dilo ki chaah meinkai maqaam aayenge jo hum ko aazmaayengebura na maano baat ka, ye pyaar hai gila nahi(if you leave (me with) this incomplete feeling day-after-dayhow are we going to sustain?'coz love is demanding and life tests uswhat I say isn't meant to hurt,for it's no complaint, it's only love.)Yes, I could go on and on about the songs from Hum Dono. Remember, I haven't even spoken about my other favorites from the film - 'dukh aur sukh ke raaste...' and 'mein zindagi ka saath...'. Who are we kidding? Take away the songs from the film, and Hum Dono would barely be known to our generation. Of course, there are some very strong dialogues too, but they sound way too profound because of their pseudo-preachy tone. A line that stayed with me even though it was rather out-of-context is, ""thukraaya hua pyaar kabhi bujhta nahi, dhuaan udta rehta hai"" (unrequited love never dies, it always comes back to haunt you) will sound only 'blech' in a film made today. And that I think is the power of pure language, no SMS-ese, no  Hinglish. How else could that simile with a burning cigar helpfully letting out smoke on the screen have worked?Actually, Hum Dono must be on very few ""favorites"" list. It has its share of screeching violins that amplify the already melodramatic moments. And the twists go far beyond believability. Even if you believe there are six faces in the world that are similar to yours and even if you believe Anand (Dev Anand) coincidentally lives in the same city and is a soldier in the same platoon as his look alike Manohar (Dev Anand), what happens in the second half of the story is at best, comical. And despite that, the showdown between each of the women and Dev Anand are moving. You feel for Meeta's (Sadhna) frustration when she feels that her wait for Anand's return has been in vain and Roma (Nanda) touches you with her single-minded devotion to her husband. Again this is because you are travelling back in time. Today in all likelihood, she would be a mere laughing stock. But these films from yore are such a lovely reminder of our innocence. And am I glad I could watch it in all its glory. I love watching films in theaters. Other than the obvious reasons - better picture and sound quality, general ambience, etc - it is the fact that, the film was made to be viewed like that which attracts me to the cinema hall. So, even though oldies like Hum Dono might play on TV, such re-releases are our only chance of catching them on the big screen. While I wouldn't mind seeing the black and white versions. But, if sustaining an almost three-hour film takes a little color in this special-effects age, so be it. The colorization added as much as it took away from the film. Sure, glitches like only one of Sadhna's eyes had make-up on are negligible. But, the inconsistency in camerawork, namely the choppy switch in and out of soft focus became even more glaring with the use of color. On the other hand, the pastel shades make each frame a painting of a jaded-yet-beautiful texture. Almost like it doesn't want you to forget the dated value system it advocates. And if you are one who can watch a film for its paintings and its poetry, make sure you have that special hand to hold with you. For the love of its music and lyrics, I wish I hadn't watched Hum Dono alone.This shot of a woman trying her best to be there for her man, is etched in my memory.    ]"
641,"[I heard about Amelie for the first time during the 2001 edition of the Academy Awards, when it was being hailed as the favourite to win for Best Foreign Language film. The trailers, rich in colour, had caught my attention much more than the winner in that category, No Man's Land. Ashutosh Gowariker (who was lobbying for Lagaan) had described Amelie as a ""very cute film"".Ten years later, when the DVD of the film officially released in India, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. It had been a long wait and the film lived up to my expectations. This charming comedy is about a young girl, Amelie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) with a lonely childhood. She grows up and thanks to a miraculous coincidence of destiny, decides to become a do-gooder, helping people around her find happiness. In the process, she embarks on finding some happiness for herself, as she falls in love with a stranger who, just like her, gets joy out of life's simple pleasures.The film is like watching an artist's dynamic and alive canvas, for close to two hours. Few films have captured Paris so beautifully as this film has - every frame is the stuff picture postcards are made of, dripping with pastry shades and colours that have been brought to life by some meticulous digital retouching. The film is an achievement in cinematography with agile zoom-ins, top angle shots and soft, delicious lighting that makes every frame endearing. It also lends a certain swiftness and smooth flow to the film's story, complimenting the stylishly crafted screenplay. Paris looks like a fairy-tale throughout the film and director Jean Pierre Jeunet plays it up by introducing scenes that re-inforce that feeling (the scene at a funfair, for example.) Tautou's close-ups have a certain discipline about them, depicting her shy nature with regularity, yet exuding a certain charm, which the actor has perfected in this film. Amelie is also a lesson in drawing character outlines and sub-plots. The writers manage to make menial stuff look interesting, by giving each character distinct eccentric shades. So there's a neighbour who sleeps all day, a bullying vegetable vendor down the street, a book-stall owner who cannot resist some gossip, a customer at a restaurant who pops bubble-wrap to pass time, an artist who has bones as brittle as glass. And there's a young man, Nino (Mathieu Kassowitz) who collects one-minute photos which end up being discarded. The wild-goose-chase that brings Amelie and Nino together is a highlight of the film, as is a kiss shared by the two. It is one of my favourite first kisses on screen - gentle, innocent, sweet, cute, deserving, all rolled into one. The absence of a background score during those moments makes the kiss almost perfect. The soundtrack of the film lends the film a lot of its casual, whimsical feel. It's a score that has over the years begun to be associated as very French, and full credit to musician Yann Tiersen for the same. Some tracks from the film have been my ringtones for a long time. And whenever my phone has rung and people have  remarked, ""Isn't that from Amelie?"", I've smiled and  realised what wonders Tiersen's melodies have worked on audiences.The Indian edition of the DVD, released by Shemaroo is heavily censored, and therefore the U/A rating. Amelie's childbirth scene, the shot where she guesses how many people in this world must be having an orgasm at that moment, and a lovemaking scene in the toilet of a restaurant, are all censored. Naturally, those scenes seem abrupt in the DVD. Further, the absence of any DVD extras is a major downer. I would have really loved to see the making of the film and the director's commentary. Despite having watched a really good film, the DVD left me feeling incomplete.]"
642,"[There are only so many ways to portray fate-defying love in a film. There's tough love, where the pair fights against all odds. There's the cheesy way, where you're made to believe the couple were always meant to be together and there's Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. The latter is a story about a man and a woman, but it is interspersed with memories in such a manner, it forms a mashed, tangy concoction that tastes of our favorite cliche: Love conquers all.The Academy award-winning screenplay written by Charlie Kaufman is one of a kind. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) randomly meet on the train and hit it off. They're an unlikely pair; Joel is passive, meek and yet bursting with intense thoughts. Clementine is fresh, impulsive and like a sweet smelling lightening bolt. The film goes back and forth in time to reveal to the viewers that these two have been together before their chance meeting. A scientific procedure they both undergo, allows them to erase certain memories. You're running around with them, trying to remember why they were in love, what they forgot and remember, who erased who first- but you're not running in along a straight line or even once-around a circle. It's an insane loop, going round and round, leaving a little jolt at every breather. It's a thrilling experience - but one that can be experienced only by living it through. The core of the film lays in the questions it leaves you with- Do memories define our existence? Are forgotten memories an easy route to blissful ignorance? Are we really better off erasing memories that cause pain? The editing and cinematography are crisp, achieving the purpose of an anticipated confusion. Background score consists of an inspiring mix of songs, all pointing to the themes of the film. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are fascinating in the film. They play all parts with utmost conviction, be it the conflicted past, the warped memories they are transported into or the ignorant present. As a viewer you are constantly wondering how such opposites could be crushed into the power of love, so much so that they get two chances to walk their journey.The Focus edition of the DVD has some bonus features including an audio commentary with Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, where they discuss the concept, the production hassles and deleted scenes. It also has a 7 min making of clip, which is more like a trailer, but the prize of the DVD is a 12 min witty conversation between Michel Gondry and Jim Carrey where they both talk about the relationship between an actor and a director and how Carrey interpreted the story of the film. Watching Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is similar to having someone make you rapidly walk forward, then backwards and then forward again with a kaleidoscope, for an hour and a half. Your head becomes woozy, you might not understand or be able to conclude but you'll realize that love happens in many ways. You can't really re-attach broken pieces of a vintage vase and pretend that it never broke, but you won't be able throw it away either. It'll lie somewhere in the corner of your house, and you're going to run into it at some point- much like the memories Joel and Clementine share of one another. Can a spotless mind ever stay eternally bright? ]"
643,"['Life is more than fair' even if things don't actually turn out the way you'd like them. A beautiful thought, especially where many of us are competing in cynicism. But by the time you reach that conclusion with Utt Patang you are pretty bored with what's going. Because of repetition; because of jokes that might have worked well on paper, but didn't quite get there when delivered; because the lines that led up to the joke were as plain as they could get.And that's what is sad. Good gags getting murdered by mediocre writing or over/under-acting. Here at least, the performers do their job well. Sure, Vinay Pathak goes over-the-top when he plays Lucky, the underworld don obsessed by everything French - I told ya, it sounds funny, but isn't as funny to watch - we can hardly fault Vinay Pathak, it's the way the character is written. Besides he does a wonderful job as Ram, though nothing we haven't seen earlier. (There's no particular agenda behind Vinay Pathak's double role, but I liked the choice of names for them - an obvious reference one of my favorite comedies, Golmaal.)While Saurabh Shukla too does his usual thing of being the round man who everyone can laugh at, I thoroughly enjoyed Mona Singh's performance. Her confused, zombie-like daze is just what a woman who has recently broken up would wear. Mahie Gill sticks out like a sore thumb in this milieu. Maybe it is her loud character, maybe bad make-up, maybe the off-dubbing or then again, maybe it's just plain bad acting. What works best is the way in which the film is put together. I'm not talking about the editing or the transitions, but the non-linear narration flows back and forth smoothly. And the beauty is that even after the audience has put together the pieces in order, the basic plot has potential to maintain attention. I always disproportionately like parts of films that fool me. In a couple of scenes I cringed at the repetition of dialogue, only to find out later that the redundancy had a strong reason. Unfortunately, none of this adds up to a film that entertains or enlightens or gets me to stand up for a character or slap one. It's one of those films that you'd watch if it happened to be playing while switching channels. Such a viewing might then seem just about fair.]"
644,"[Yeh Saali Zindagi is a crime comedy that hooks you in like any thriller should and tickles you throughout, exactly like a good comedy would. Kidnappers goof-up, victims of the crime offer help and end up in messier situations. These are the kinds of situations that Yeh Saali Zindagi is built upon. The basic plot is whacky  - just like the individual tracks and the characters. Just as you get used to one sub-plot a new twist is waiting its turn, and yet it doesn't feel rushed. Magically, the events of the previous scene have registered. Surprisingly, at no point is there information overload, which could be an issue for films that go back and forth. Your comfort with the proceedings could well be because all non-linearity is only in terms of flashbacks and most of it is in context too. For example, a character goes into happy memories of the past to relieve himself of physical pain and so on. I thoroughly enjoyed the wit in the writing. It's not just clever dialogue - the overall story, the build-up, and the sequence in which the sub-plots come also have inbuilt humor. I might have enjoyed it better if I knew more about the characters, not in terms of backstory, but anything that made me feel for them - it'd have been nice to connect an emotion to a character. But then again, it's not required that I feel for anyone in a film that falls in this bracket - a dark comedy. I enjoyed their idiosyncrasies for what they are. A lot of it is of course, credited to Irrfan Khan. The man has just the perfect sense of timing that this kind of humor needs. Chitrangda Singh too is one of the reasons why you want to watch this film. There are a host of other characters and interesting actors playing them out, but none other than Arunoday Singh have enough screen time. Arunoday Singh though seemed very uncomfortable and a misfit in this gang of goons. And then there are irritants like voiceovers and animated airplanes. I don't enjoy voiceovers in general, but ones which educate you about 'life' have to be really profound to maintain the interest. Also, they have become such an integral part of Hindi films of this genre that the tone used is the same and so is the manner in which it is delivered. Another downer are the choppy edits, the kind I found disorienting in director, Sudhir Mishra's earlier film Khoya Khoya Chand. And this too I could have lived with, without complaining, because of the smart content. But the lame and unnecessary superimposed text showed that the director/writer seemed to have lost respect for his audience in post-production. Also the silly animation had no rhyme or rhythm. The intention must have been to make it comic, but the animation just didn't fit with the rest of the humor in the film. There are other decisions which made the film a richer experience. The camerawork made it a trippy experience. Though I don't understand why so many shots (day shots too) are almost completely dark. Did they take the genre too literally? But since there are so many scenes where the actors can barely be seen, it feels like the lighting decisions are made to hide their lack of skill. What counts though is that the film is enjoyable despite the dark ambience. What is remarkable is the performances aren't breathtaking, the characters don't connect but the general feeling of having watched a good film stays with you. ]"
645,"[The DVD of Amelia, is a bit of a surprise. Despite featuring an award winning starcast, an acclaimed director (Monsoon Wedding, The Namesake) and a biopic about a historical figure - a category that's a soft spot for critics - this film has no blurbs on its front or back cover. Not a single one. No stars, no ratings or recommendations from any film reviewers. At first, I thought it was a layout faux pas - maybe they forgot to add those. To be sure, I then remembered how something was amiss when the film released theatrically in India. There was hardly any buzz in the media, no celebratory coverage considering Mira Nair helmed this big Hollywood project. There's two-time Oscar winning actress Hillary Swank in the title role of Amelia Earheart, Richard Gere plays George Putnam, her manager and husband, and Ewan McGregor is Gene Vidal, her lover. But the consensus amongst reviewers and audiences has been common - this film could have been so much better.After having seen the film on DVD, I think that opinion isn't entirely wrong. But considering the amount of trash that Hollywood throws up on screen most of the time, I think Amelia, is still fairly watchable. The screenwriters must have obviously come across too much literature that already exists - three books are credited for the adaptation - about the first woman pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic, who disappeared somewhere over the Pacific ocean on a trip attempting to circumnavigate the world.It's a dilemma that even the writers of the Harry Potter franchise face in every film: How to pack it all into a two-hour film? But Earheart's biopic is no spell-binding special effects bonanza. Sure, there are some spectacular aerial shots of her plane crossing continents - fondly recollecting the journey of her life. It only touches the skeleton of Amelia Earheart, hardly managing to get into her soul and depict what a head-strong woman she was to be able to convince a male-dominated society about determination to fly. Solo.This film makes it appear that the task must not have been that difficult, given Putnam's (Gere) support. He is  a master strategist, a publisher who always seems to be cracking deals, using her name, appearance and knowledge wonderfully to create intellectual property, resulting in wealth for the two of them. There is rarely a scene that makes you go 'Wow, what a woman she was!', when the truth is that she was indeed a woman who's achievements and characters did make Americans go 'Wow'.Gene Vidal (McGregor) has a role which is rather forgettable - he mouths about 7-8 lines in the film and one would have wanted to see so much more of him. Gere (Putnam) plays the loyal husband well, but there is very little chemistry between him and Amelia. Before they get married, their romance seems rushed and although Putnam is devoted, one is not clear whether its a marriage of convenience since he realises she is the hen that lays golden eggs, or he genuinely has fallen in love with her.Hillary Swank puts in a sincere effort and her Kansas twang, coupled with her make-up give some authenticity and weight to the real persona of Earheart. Much like the aeroplanes she flies in the film, she glides through her role with ease. The character is sought after, but the performance isn't.Despite its shortcomings, I did feel a sense of pride that this is Mira Nair's film. I'd put little fault on her - it is the writing that lets her down. The film has some high points, the climax being one of them. It's gripping, tense and is extremely well put together. I think there must have been pressure on her in deciding what parts to keep and what parts to edit, since the final output that this film projects of Earheart is of a very non-offensive nature. The kind which wouldn't want to upset the succeeding generations of the lead protagonists.You become sure about this when you see the deleted scenes in the DVD extras. It throws some light on Amelia's love life before she met Putnam. It also introduces us to a character mercilessly chopped out from the final cut - that of Putnam's first wife. All her scenes were removed from the film.I must also point out that the DVD extras noted on the cover are a bit of lie. The disc inside doesn't have a Making of Amelia, The Power of Amelia Earheart, Movietone News and Trailers. Now, that's cheating, the last thing one needs after seeing a disappointing film.]"
646,"[What could possibly go wrong diving in caves?You have to watch Sanctum to know. I was in a mood for survivor movies, after 127 Hours last week. Though Sanctum is about survival, it comes off more as a drama-heroic-adventure movie. And it says what all movies of this genre say - ""never ever give up"". The film has simply superb 3D effects. I was never so impressed by 3D before, not even in Avatar  or Tron Legacy.After the brilliant scene with the ice cream in Chhota Chetan nostalgia, this is the only 3D movie where I felt like extending my hand to shove that bottle out of the way, and at times it felt like I was standing beside the crew all the time. I wanted to reach out and help. The narrow restrictions almost make you claustrophobic, and yet the vastness of the caves demands exhilaration. And unlike the other movies, this one has 3D all the time - like, even the rain was 3D. With all the breathtaking underwater scenes and that diffused light, it is sheer beauty. Unfortunately, all you can say about screenplay is - same old, same old. Actually, I can make it sound more interesting to you here than it is to watch it. That will at least make the ineptitude of the story look less prominent and you can concentrate on the magnificence of the caves. But since this is ""Without Giving the Movie Away"", I'll refrain :). Yet I need to say this - why do they always have to add melodrama in the ""inspired by true story"" films? Bah, that puts me off every time. But on the other hand, I feel thankful it isn't made to look like a video podcast on the Discovery Channel, even if I love those. In spite of the predictable plot, it still leaves you wondering about man versus wild. Maybe it's not completely convincing. Yet it's an evil reminder. It says more about human instincts, how it can lead you to make choices you that wouldn't have otherwise been made. And that you can do things, because you have to. But of course, it is shown so much more dramatically.In spite of the terrible dialogues and mediocre acting, I'll say go and watch Sanctum for the visuals. Thanks to the cinematography, I can totally understand why those divers would want to take terrible risks - to explore a place ""where you can shine a light where no human's been"".Please note - I watched it in IMAX 3D and think that the awesome scenes that I wrote about probably won't feel the same in regular 3D.]"
647,"[Mark Wahlberg is suddenly becoming the Akshay Kumar of Hollywood. The man with a rather straight face, is mouthing absurd, yet funny lines (""I'm a peacock! You've gotta let me fly!"") The same way that Akki would do in a Priyadarshan film. Wahlberg's traits work nicely when paired with Will Ferrell, quintessentially funny man, in The Other Guys, a film about two detectives in New York's police department who do nothing more than mundane paperwork on existing cases, rather than be a part of adrenaline pumping car chases to nail down criminals like real investigators would. Although Hoitz (Wahlberg) wants to go out and shoot some guns like real cops do, he struggles to inspire his geeky desk partner Gamble (Ferrell) to rise to the occasion and together, become the city's heroes. The humour essentially lies in their mismatch and the pairing of the two actors is funny. There is some crackling dialogue, most of which had me in splits thanks to both actors complimenting each other well. Hoitz leaves no stone unturned to let Gamble know how much he hates him, but the total nerd that Gamble is, he doesn't mind. Captain Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton), who plays boss to both characters is equally funny as the senior cop with a bisexual son, and who has a weekend passion of running a supermarket which sells luxury toiletries. The film is a wonderful product placement for the Toyota Prius, the car that the lead actors use for most of their assignments. I loved the way the car's features were embedded with Gamble's character and mannerisms. The writing and performances have enough to provoke laughter and these comic scenes are well-connected to ensure that the film is not just a series of gags one after the other. There's something about staring at Will Ferrell's face that produces a tingling in my funny bone. He's one of the better slapstick actors, but one who doesn't have to try too hard to show off his comic timing. The film is an action comedy, against the backdrop of the embezzlement of funds. There's action - lots of it, most of which is pretty well executed. But the screenplay is patchy, a bit formulaic and I'm not sure if I can blame the writers entirely - action comedies as a genre continue to be like this. The non-stop bullying from Hoitz and Gamble's colleagues seems forced. Moreover, I couldn't fathom why Hoitz would want the calculator loving Gamble to join him in his investigative pursuits. How did the two become partners in the first place? A bit of history into how they met and how they became resigned to boring desk jobs, would have added some colour to the story. The sub-plot of Hoitz's failed romance and his ability to do the ballet really well, doesn't add up to the film's overall proceedings in any way. The extras on the DVD are a bit of a lip-service. There are some deleted scenes - meaningless, most of them. However, the behind-the-scenes footage of the stunts is interesting, as are the interviews with the director and the actors.The Other Guys has got several flaws, in addition to everything that comes with a formulaic script. But it's a funny film alright.]"
648,"[The heart - it is allowed to behave like a child; especially when it's in lhhove and all. But what is unacceptable is to allow a kid - however grown-up he might be - to write a full-length feature film. The situations are amateur and the play on words is childish. If you are not convinced of the low standards of story and dialogue writing in the first two hours, watch out (if you are going to watch that is) for the down-market climax.Within the first few minutes of the film, the three lead characters and their problems are presented to you. This is done as plainly and as non-creatively as possible - which is true of the rest of the narrative too. It is literally Ajay Devgn's love story - cut - Omi Vaidya's love story - cut - Emraan Hashmi's love story - cut - repeat. Within the first few rounds, you can predict where the next cut in the story is going to take you. To the next of the three characters and whatever he is upto next. Only that, whatever is happening in his life next is pretty much similar to what happened last. Ajay Devgn is the clueless, middle-aged boss falling helplessly in love with a girl almost half his age. And he keeps falling in love. There's nothing out of this world that this actor is required to do. Emraan Hashmi (they call him Abby) is the playboy -- surprise! -- who is always thinking of the next girl to take to bed. Even when he likes one more than the others, it seems like he has only one aim in mind. A been-there-done-that for him too. Omi Vaidya (Milind Kelkar) is a simpleton and proud of it. Once he falls in love he lets the woman take him for a ride. Again and again. Omi's performance was almost a repeat of his 3 Idiots character. Also his timing is completely off. He actually had a couple of good lines which are completely given away by the way he said themNow apart from these repetitions, there was this constant nag. I am rooting for no one. Not even the good-natured, squeaky-clean-at-heart, aawww-so-sweet-that-he's-boring Milind. And I think a lot of it had to do with timing. Maybe just maybe, the lame lines I was complaining about might have been tolerable if they were delivered as quickly as a comedy requires them to be. An extra pause here, a moment of thought there puts an ailing dialogue to sleep. In the midst of some dreadful writing, it is disproportionately refreshing to see some sort-of variety in character for a couple of the women in the film. Not that the details are deeply thought through, but since they are performed reasonably well, they provided some relief in the otherwise plain narrative. Tisca Chopra as the woman going through mid-life crisis and Shraddha Das as the woman who can misuse people around her were the only source of relief - the characters as much as the actors themselves. On the other hand, Shruti Hassan has the flattest dialogue delivery ever and it got too damn annoying even if it was a smaller role compared to the others. And it is difficult to judge if Shazahn Padamsee can act if all she has to do is chirp, ""please please please please please."" Sure, her character requires her to do that, so we will save judgment until she gets some real dialogue. And what's with Madhur Bhandarkar paying a tribute to all his films? Just when you are wondering if a glimpse from Page 3 and Corporate are coincidental, you witness a ramp walk and a jail is thrown in too. Sure, his attempt is not as in the face as other self-referencing directors manage. And though it does sort-of weave in and out of the film, it is still distracting. Oh yeah, and there is the trademark referencing to homosexuality too. But this time around its really shoddy and stereotypical.Madhur Bhandarkar's trial at exposing the big-bad world of love turned out to be a 75-minute wait for the interval followed by another 75-minute wait for it to end. You don't care how, you don't care why, all you care about is when. ]"
649,"[There's something weird about past tense. No matter how old you are, you hold your happiest memories so close to you that they seem to have unfolded only yesterday. Watching Toy Story 3 made me rummage through every cupboard in my house trying to find a Hot Wheels car that I used to play with, when  was a kid. I'm 24 now and and I felt melancholic about not being able to find it. Suddenly, out of the blue, I feel a longing for all my toys. And you might feel the same, if you've also had a set of toys that you always played with in your childhood.Toy Story 3 is the most emotional chapter of the series, which saw its first film debut way back in 1995. Come to think of it, like every happy memory, this too seems like only yesterday. And the third instalment's success and acclaim (winning an Oscar nomination for Best Picture) symbolizes an important moment in animation film history. This is the second year in a row that Disney Pixar's produced a such a good film - last year, Up was nominated in the same category.On DVD, a single viewing of the film is enough to convince that such acknowledgment is well-deserved. Right from the film's opening sequence (a fitting tribute to the Westerns, Jurassic Park, E.T, Superman), Toy Story 3 is an immersive experience. At times, it throws up a question that we're often faced in life - should we be there for someone with whom we're 'meant to be', or should be learn to move on as times have changed? Director Lee Unkrich helps you find the answer through a premise that we could see coming. Andy, the child who owns the toys, is now grown-up and is about to leave home for a new life in college. Faced with a decision to dispose off or donate his old toys, his mother, mistakenly ends up handing them over to a day-care centre where a new life awaits Woody and gang.One of the biggest strengths of the Toy Story series is that it successfully manages to help humans, empathise with the emotions of toys. Every toy wants to be played with and in the process, feel a sense of bonhomie, heroism and companionship with its owner. Every toy wants to be a character in whatever fantasy a child conjures up in its head - no matter how stupid it may be. It likes loyalty. Which is why, although excited by the colourful exteriors of the daycare centre, they find grief in the kind of treatment meted out to them. Clearly, abandonment and rejection from their owners are the biggest heart-breakers for toys.The script weaves in these themes by introducing a new set of characters - the teddy bear Lotso (Ned Beatty) being the most noteworthy of them. He is huggable on the outside, but grim inside, and it makes him one of the most unique, cold blooded villains you've seen in animation films.Toy Story 3 promises more thrills than laughs, honestly. That may hamper repeat viewing, in my opinion (I skimmed through several sequences on second viewing) but those thrills serve a purpose. For the first time, you're confronted with the possibility of seeing these toys destroyed. It's a poignant moment in the film, one that reminds us of how close we've become to Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and gang, over the years. It's also the reason why the climax is an emotional one.The rich collection of bonus features in the DVD makes this an almost ideal home video buy. Among the highlights, there's an outstanding theatrical short (Day and Night) which has all the wit and social subtext that comes with Disney Pixar shorts. In other features, my favourite is a set of three videos, titled Studio Stories. They give us an awe inspiring glimpse of life and culture at Pixar - for example, a cereal bar stocks almost every kind of cereal on the planet. You'll also learn that the crew shaved off their head and moustache before working on this film. There's also a heartwarming tribute to the significance of editors in a film, especially an animation one. A number of editors talk to the camera to explain what they do and how they make a difference in the entire pipeline of tasks that comes with putting together a film like this. The behind- the-scenes, interviews with the cast and crew round up the extras on the DVD nicely.]"
650,"[Mountain climber Aron Ralston gets pinned against a rock wall in a canyon in Utah for 127 hours, and his now famous feat for survival is captured in this film. The story is practically unbelievable until you hear that it is real, from the book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" by Aron Ralston himself. It is about a life-or-death experience that one man goes through, and the courage and determination that he shows to keep himself sane through it. This is a man who believes in life, and knows that a body can do anything to survive. It is natural to have high expectations from Danny Boyle after his Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire. And true to his commitment and hard work, he gives us a film that leaves us thinking. It is a story not of a hero, but of a survivor. Screenplay is a wee bit stretched, but that really does build up the tension. Music is good, but we have certainly heard better from Rahman. The absolutely brilliant cinematography by Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle might as well get them an Oscar. It is the best part of the movie, apart from the captivating reality of the story, of course. The direction of photography is used to a very exciting effect, even after being confined to a tiny place with a literally unmovable man. Smart editing and the use of split-screen to present the adrenaline really worked. And the top views of the canyon to show the scale of operation are simply stupendous. James Franco does an excellent job as a hiker who loves the canyon and desert. He came off as a complete surprise to me, because I had only thought of him as Green Goblin's cute son in the Spiderman series. Here, he is a thrill seeker who gets stuck in as bad a position as one can get into, where he has all the time to introspect and come out on the other side - a changed man. It is outstanding how Franco makes you feel the pain, the frustration, the hope, the disappointment. Every line on his face tells the story as he immerses himself in the role. Better still is the fact that the film almost entirely casts only him, and yet he manages to not bore the audience. In fact, there are scenes which bring goose bumps. Obviously, the film is overwhelming. I couldn't sit through it in one go - had to take a break and come back. It could be because I couldn't bear to look at the helpless situation, or it could be because the movie was not captivating enough. The gore - yes it does have big share of it (nothing outrageous though) - is still tolerable. What is not is the constant reminders of loneliness and hallucinations that are shown. I have no doubt that such circumstances could have the same effect on me, but it still is not very pleasant to watch. The flashbacks poke you, which makes you believe the film more and more with each scene. Though there was a lull in the flashbacks that Ralston takes you through, it still makes a good build up to what the film says in the end. It is more about a man's invincible will to live than his unthinkable act for survival. I loved the way Boyle has made the film emotionally inspirational and about the values of life as against making it look like Saw.If you can't take a little gore or can't watch continuous mental pain another person is going through, you'd rather not watch it. Else a must watch, and on the big screen for better impact. ]"
651,"[500 Days of Summer must be the most circulated / rented DVD amongst the Siddharth Anand, Punit Malhotra, Karan Johar types. It's a very obvious film to remake for Indian audiences - probably starring Imran Khan. The rom-com colours, quirky screenplay, crisp editing, non-linear story-telling and ability to laugh at itself, does a very neat invertendo of the Adam and Eve romance.Unlike the cliches cast in stone by Pyar Ke Side Effects, in this film, it is Eve who is commitment phobic, wants a relationship that is casual and relaxed, whereas Adam is emotional and wants something long term. He is the one who asks the question that guys are so scared of: ""So where do you think this is headed?"" or ""Are we a couple?""On DVD, 500 Days of Summer is a breezy, often humorous and sometimes introspective film to sit through - almost perfect if you're calling your date home. Right from the casting, apt for puppy love - Joseph Gordon Levitt (Tom) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), to the picture post-card cinematography, to the odd Farah Khan-esque choreographed number (All I want is you), to the other lilting melodies in the soundtrack, to the inventive interception of the voice-over that navigates so effortlessly between the past and present, this film is right up there on the freshness quotient.Director Marc Webb, who is helming the next instalment of Spiderman, has interpreted the script well. After a long time, here is a story about love (not a love story, mind you) that makes you think about reversal of roles.How would it be if we boys became a cling-on, refusing to move-on, commitment-desirable types and the girls wanted nothing serious, very casual and use-and-throw relationships? That's like a Harry Met Sally,  upside down. Scary thought, if you ask me. The fact that Tom is the woman in the relationship is established by some fabulous touches. I felt really sad for him. A little heartbroken.Summer's character is unique. Deschanel plays Summer to a T - she's a little eccentric, flirtatious and her long casual gaze and dialogue delivery is the most unusual I've seen among actresses.I'd have loved it if the screenplay had added a stronger back-story for her - The explanation given was a little insufficient a reason to make her that way. Why hasn't she felt love with men she's been with before? What has made her immune to the most genuine, honest advances of a guy like Tom?The writers of the film don't tell us this, but hint at possible answers. A message they strongly advocate in the film is that love may not be a real thing after all - it exists as a fantasy in our minds and our expectations from love are only fuelled by pop-songs, movies and the romances we read about.The DVD is a bit of a disappointment in terms of Bonus Features - there are just some extended / deleted scenes, but they really don't work their charms like some behind-the-scenes footage would have. Webb's direction managed to immerse me in the lives of the characters, and some interviews with the cast would have been refreshing. Sadly there's none nor any dope on the making of the film.The film has 'feel-good' written all over it - the songs are a big help - and I'd certainly classify it as a recommended viewing.]"
652,"['Sequels are worse than the originals' - is a cliched statement. And so is Little Fockers. The story line is filled with the same old fight between two patriarchs over what the family culture should be like. Egos clash, and that makes life hard for Greg Focker and his family. The miscommunication and unbending attitudes in a relationship takes a toll on the family. But in a supposedly funny way. So even if each of us can't identify with the situations, we can definitely identify with the reactions.There is very little of Little Fockers in this movie, though they are present all the time. The twins, Samantha (played by Daisy Tahan) and Henry (Colin Baiocchi), don't look like twins but do justice to smart-kid and silly-kid roles respectively. And though this film is more about adults and their problems, the director has managed to drag in the kids on all occasions. Acting is generally mediocre. Ben Stiller is good, fed up of the father-in-law trying to bully him. He and Robert De Niro put up a good duet in the given situations. I was expecting much more screen time from Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Steisand, but looks like Dustin Hoffman didn't like the script and accepted to shoot only 6 scenes. Well, after the movie I feel he was right. Jessica Alba obviously looks great - so if you are a fan you may want to catch this film. Some of the jokes are good, though there are also some irritating old ones. The best part is the slight flavor of The Godfather and Jaws. Just the right amount of reference was given which reassured me that this was not a spoof, and yet enough to make me smile remembering the classics. Although, it has one of the most uninteresting closing scenes ever. I mean, ending on a good note or a bad note is one thing. But an end which almost bores the audience, what sense does that make? The film certainly misses the hilarious situations that Meet The Parents and even Meet The Fockers had. So try not to compare if you want to have a laugh. Catch on a TV if you are really out of options. An empty mind might help getting over the frustration of 'why on earth did they make such a film?!']"
653,"[The definition of comedy has seen an immense makeover since the Shakespeare days. There's slapstick comedy, satire, black comedy and even rom-com. Similarly, there's also Haha-funny, Lol-funny and what I'd like to called 'witty-repartee' funny. But there are some films that coin their own meaning of funny. Janis and John is one such film, which translates a sense of humour into an entire movie. There's no name for it, it's just a simple film about a really funny situation. Period. Janis and John is set in France around an Insurance salesman Pablo Sterni, (Sergi Lopez) who schemes to dupe his drug-addicted cousin for 500,000 francs: by arranging for the second coming of Janis Joplin and John Lennon. It's a crazy synopsis, and the first half of the film, which constitutes the set-up of the fraud, is equally crazy. The humour tone of the film lies in this very craziness. As a viewer you wonder, how in the world is this going to work out? The two actors playing fake John Lennon (Francois Cluzet playing a failed actor) and Janis Joplin (Marie Trintignant, also Sterni's wife) are remarkably aloof in the beginning. The film graphs their con journey and the whirlpool situations they find themselves in. The fanatic cousin, Leon's (Christopher Lambert) sheer reason of existence is the return of his two rock idols. He'd been looking forward to it since he (allegedly) met them in a restroom, where they happened to promise him they would return. The first time Janis and John reach his record shop, we get a glimpse into his fanaticism. We've seen such behavior - young teenagers shouting and screaming around rock stars, girls fainting at the sight of an idol, and more such madness. However, the idea of fanaticism is dealt slightly differently in this film. Leon's record shop has everything from a replica of the revolver than killed Lennon to Joplin's favorite Whiskey, Southern Comfort. He seems like a more somber fan, but in reality through his actions you can tell his fanaticism is more about the mania - a kind that could pose some serious trouble. The rest of the film is one interesting incident after another. Cluzet and Trintignant are absolutely hilarious in the film, in their mission to be celebrities. The star of the film is most certainly Marie Trintignant, who transforms from a meek housewife to a fake Janis Joplin- but it's a transformation that will shock you. Unfortunately, Trintignant passed away in an unfortunate accident after the shooting of the film. Towards the end of the film, director Samuel Benchetrit, also Marie's huband, has included many slow, close up shots of her - posing as a silent tribute. The DVD has no special features, apart from a small 10-minute compilation of uncut scenes. They mostly show Marie and Cluzet trying to perform Lennon and Joplic songs and failing miserably. The scenes graph their struggle to be like rock icons, who in all honestly cannot be replaced. This is the reason why the film is so amusing. Dialogues and performances apart, the film is funny because it's a simple account of a highly implausible situation. Watch the film on a lazy afternoon; not for a few laughs, but for a slow, long-lasting smile. ]"
654,"[Love is elusive. Whatever the heart is after is seldom within reach. In fact, more often than we'd like, even what we 'really' want escapes us. This is the broad stroke Kiran Rao paints with Dhobi Ghat. She does so very quietly, hand-in-hand with her mild, four subdued characters. It actually feels like she's reading their diaries out to us. She passes judgment on the society we form - the young and the old, the rich and the poor, the ""educated"" and the illiterate, the secularists and the socialists. But she is almost mute as she goes about it. And none of this gets boring BUT the spark is conspicuous by its absence. Like leftover champagne from yesterday - not yet flat but not as relish-worthy as when the cork first popped. The setting could have been New York, Sydney, or even Pune. Any reasonable-size town is likely to have a slum dweller with larger-than-life aspirations, an NRI poking around the slums, an artist with an attitude, and an unsuspecting immigrant who is trying to figure the city out. Kiran Rao chose Mumbai and I'm not complaining. Mumbai does have her way of providing warmth with ruggedness, and that is the exact texture Dhobi Ghat gives the maya-nagri. Besides, I love the city and I romanticize my visits there just like Yasmin (Kriti Malhotra) does with her home videos. Her awe is as evident as her discomfort. Her resolve to find amusement in her boring life is ironic considering the hustle around her. It ain't new but the contrast hasn't come through in a movie earlier. Isn't it amazing that in a city where even stray dogs seem to be in a rush, housewives (other than Yasmin too) entertain themselves with TV in the middle of the day? You observe Yasmin along with Arun (Aamir Khan). Her simple story is absorbing. And it's very intriguing that Yasmin aroused more emotion and attachment than the more complex Arun. Maybe that's how it was meant to be, because Arun is supposed to evoke indifference. But such characters who don't make me feel anything for them leave me dissatisfied with the movie experience. Arun might just be the weakest character of the four. After all he's the only one who gets relatively melodramatic in this subtle environment, albeit only towards the end. And yet not everyone is me. Arun does manage to capture Shai's (Monika Dogra)imagination. A large part of Shai represents the stereotype of the returned-non-resident Indian who is on a poverty tour. But her emotions for Arun make you feel for her and reach out to her. And in turn you also want good things to happen to Munna (Prateik). You know his desires are beyond his reach, but you smile at his immaturity and want him to learn from his mistakes. I loved the person he grows to become. Like them or not, each character has been written in detail and has an arc of their own. And that is what keeps the viewer going in this otherwise dull ambience. There are some brilliant, mostly-earthy performances; except for Aamir Khan who pretty much stays the star he is. There's also the slight touch of humor. But, it slides into documentary mode every once in a while. There are certainly no conclusions, no strong messages, nothing that can be called 'entertaining'. The intention is to leave the audience high and dry.Yet the seasoned festival delegate will find Dhobi Ghat like every other 'decent' film he sees. And the masala-seeker might just curse the money he spent on the Aamir Khan brand. It is for the in-betweens that the film will work for best. And this takes nothing away from debutant director Kiran Rao. I like her casting. The charming faces are the aces in her sleeve. I like the milieu she has created, especially the home video parts. I like her taste in background music and her decisions on when to use it and not. And yet I can't point a finger at why this was a fine but not a wholesome experience. Maybe because I'm made to see how lonely each one of us is, no matter what our background is...]"
655,"[There are some years when certain gems remain hidden or underexposed because a far bigger gem steals the show completely. The year 2009 saw Disney Pixar's Up do that to most other animation films, as it won all major awards. Fantastic Mr Fox was a victim. Since it did not receive a deserving theatrical release in India - distributors are very wary of stop-motion films, it appears -  it can finally seek some redemption since it is available on DVD.For those of you who've become habitual viewers of every single Pixar and Dreamworks product, Fantastic Mr Fox is a refreshing experience for a multitude of reasons. One, this animation film has been shot completely in stop motion. It gives the film a very hand-made, indie feel.Two, it features voices that you never thought could be voices for foxes. Drumroll please George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon (of Dumbledore fame from Harry Potter), Owen Wilson, Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzmann.Clooney, the voice of Mr Fox is the film's biggest plus - just listening to his voice elevates the film to a new level - he's full of attitude, chutzpah and class that's rare with voices that are trying too hard to emote in an animation film. It's like watching an Ocean's Eleven in animation, what with Mr Fox, a family man, newspaper columnist, keen to go back to his hunting ways as he plots the most famous chicken heist of all time. His wife, Mrs Fox (Streep) however doesn't approve of this and the entire community of beavers, rabbits and other pests gets into trouble.There's a reason why it's call Mister Fox and Clooney's the man giving him a voice. The actor clearly represents the epitome of masculinity and the story essentially is about how men, once married have to hold the reins on their wild, hunting ways that they so enjoyed in their days of bachelorhood. So while chasing chickens and stealing them was fine once upon a time, the responsibility of being a family man must bring some control on such vicarious pleasures after having a son and a stable family life to support.While it puts forward this argument, it also provides Mr Fox to speak his mind - men do want to be fantastic, awesome and simply the best, despite the boundaries that family life brings. Thankfully, the screenplay balances both sides of the argument well and celebrates every family member's uniqueness. Even the little ones have their own qualities to bring forth in an hour of crisis. Ash (Schwartzmann) who is Fox's son, for example is always keen to be productive and useful - he even wants to be with his father during the heist - but is not allowed to. He gets his chance to prove himself though.The humour in the film is somewhat the cool types - it does not make you laugh out loud - but it does have a certain charm that is amusing to kids and adults alike. If you've seen director Wes Anderson's earlier film, The Darjeeling Limited, you'll know what I'm talking about.You don't quite begin to appreciate the film until you witness the meticulous amount of detailing that's gone into converting this Roald Dahl story into a stop motion film. Which is where the extras on the DVD come as a big bonus. The film if you look at the bigger picture, is essentially a  flip book format of over 60,000 still photographs shot using a Nikon camera, which gives it a very HD feel. The textures, colours and setting of the village is very similar to where Dahl lived himself and the actors recorded their voices in a real farm-house in the countryside and not in a studio, as is usually the case. So many miniatures, so much effort - the efforts seem mind boggling.The stop motion is far better than Mel Gibson's Chicken Run and although you might find it uncomfortable at the beginning, by the time Clooney's voice plays tricks with your senses, you'll forget what's stop motion and what's 3D animation.Fantastic Mr Fox is recommended viewing with family, kids and friends. Try it on a weekend.]"
656,"[Tangled is a story of the long haired princess Rapunzel. ""Oh, but we all know the story of Rapunzel, so whats new in there?"" - you may ask. Aherm, absolutely great visuals for starters. This is the first CGI fairytale from Disney and it is totally worth the wait. For once, they've made some intelligent use of 3D technology and the scenes are not forced. The story is predictable, but isn't that the case with all Disney animated movies in general? No one goes to watch Disney animation movies for their brilliant plot. We go there to laugh &amp; cry and sing &amp; dance with the characters we know we are going to fall in love with. Tangled does all that with great finesse. It has some very imaginative and lovely characters, especially the horse and the chameleon. Irrelevant and needless information alert: My love for movies descends largely from my dad, and my elder brother. But Dad loves action, brother is a sucker for science fiction and I had a particular liking for murder mysteries. Animated movies were something we all liked immensely and always made up for a good watch together. The point is animated films have that quality to bring a family together. To have in it, something for everyone. To give everyone a happy time. I love musicals. Though, Tangled is not your classic musical, it certainly has its elements. Alan Menken has a done a superb job with the music and Glen Slater's lyrics are great too. Some of the songs bore striking resemblance to Mulan, that probably would be because both movies share the same director in Byron Howard (co-director in case of Tangled as Nathan Greno was mentioned as the director too). Let the records reflect that I'm now officially a fan of this guy.  'When will my life begin' felt a lot like Mulan's 'Reflection' and 'I've got a dream' had a  'A girl worth fighting for' like ring to it. I've listened a lot to Mulan's OST and am looking forward to listen to Tangled's too. Usually, if the voice-over artists are not the singers too, its a huge turn off. Thankfully, Tangled had a voice-over artist who could sing masterfully - Mandy Moore. She's done a fabulous job as Rapunzel. But I expect excellence in singing from Mandy Moore. Who surprised me was Zachary Levi. Donna Murphy was all class as the evil Mother Gothel. The supporting cast was superb in their small yet thoroughly entertaining roles.I guess, I've convinced you enough, so grab a few friends or take your family along with you and enjoy this movie. If you have kids its a crime punishable by law in the state of Neverland, not to take your kids for this movie. Watch in theatres for sure.]"
657,"[The great Orson Welles (Citizen Kane) once famously remarked about Vittorio De Sica's Shoeshine, ""It was as if the camera disappeared, the screen disappeared. It was just life (unfolding in front of the audience).""You certainly get that feeling while watching Shoeshine, now considered one of the first cinematic gems to pioneer the neo-realism movement in films.Neo-realism, we learnt in college, is where an individual is a victim of the system, and although he tries to revolt against it and find a way around it, he hits a roadblock and becomes desperate and is eventually nailed down. My first brush with neo-realism was in The Bicycle Thieves, a film that I slept through the first time I saw it, but on second viewing I liked it so much, I became a De Sica fan for life. That's what made me look up Shoeshine and his other films. One may say that majboori ka doosra naam Vittorio De Sica, because he was one of those rare film-makers who captured the desperation of the helpless and unemployed in heart wrenching stories.Shoeshine (Ragazzi) revolves around two young boys - Pasquale Maggi (Franco Interlenghi) and Guiseppe Fillipucci (Rinaldo Smordoni) - who shine shoes for a living and have collected just about enough money to buy a horse. However, a series of unfortunate events lands them in juvenile prison, where circumstances not only separate them, but also pit them against each other.It's a touching story of the consequences of war and how the innocence of children is its first casualty. It's a theme that even Iranian film-maker Bahman Ghobadi's touched upon in Turtles Can Fly. Shoeshine however uses a much more mature brush to depict how unsuspecting kids become pawns in a larger criminal set-up and how this accentuates violence in their lives.De Sica doesn't show these things in the Madhur Bhandarkar way - there's no sensationalism about things - as Orson Welles puts it - you simply see life in a prison unfolding. Personally, I'm a sucker for prison dramas (The Shawshank Redemption being my favourite film, ever) and although Shoeshinedoesn't make any startling revelations about life behind bars, it certainly showcases mundane as mundane should be.What makes it all look so convincing is some fantastic direction by De Sica to a cast of non-actors, a strategy he's adopted earlier in The Bicycle Thieves. It makes you sympathise a lot more easily with the tears that a character sheds, laugh with them at the dark humour and feel upset about the way things finally turn out.Shoeshine wasn't a commercial success - I doubt if neo-realistic films ever make a profit, but their social documentation is impeccable and they make a profound statement about society, its evils and its victims. Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, another neo-realistic masterpiece for example, wasn't a box-office hit. But like all other films in its genre, it attained cult status over the years.The film, however did win the first ever Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and went on to inspire many reforms in the way post-war Italy treated its children.That's a reason enough to celebrate this film.]"
658,"[How many times have you heard the phrase, ""Revenge is a dish best served cold""? How cold do you think? Think deeply, about just how cold revenge can get. If you multiply that into 10, you'll get the essence of Park Chan-wook's Old Boy. A South Korean film that gained popularity after winning the Grand Prix at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, Old Boy will take you on a visual expedition where you'll flinch, cover your eyes and stare in awe at the impact of vengeance.  Old Boy is the second installment of the vengeance trilogy, by Park Chan-wook, the other two being Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. The film revolves around Oh DeaSu (Choi Min-sik) who is imprisoned for 15 years, with no plausible reason that he could comprehend. He finds himself in a maze of conspiracies once he is unexpectedly released. His aim, then, is to seek revenge with the person behind the brutal captivation. This is about 10 percent of the film. It has a gripping plot, that pulls the film forward, but the true beauty of Old Boy lies in how the film deals with human emotions when put in extreme situations. It makes you question who gives us the authority to punish, how far would someone go to seek revenge- Physical Torture? Solitary confinement? Death? And the most important question of all- Does revenge really liberate you from the pain of a horrible incident? Without any answers, Old Boy incorporates a rigid mission with DeaSu and explores all those questions. You can sense his desperation. He moves between a series of emotions: anger, trepidation, regret, despair. And you move through these emotions with him. But behind all the violence, you aren't meant to lose faith in humanity but to question the depths of human destruction and witness the way in which we rise back. You can notice the similarities that Old Boy shares with films like Kill Bill and Fight Club. But it stands out because along with letting you enjoy the triumphant violence and behavioral patterns of a desperate person put in absurd circumstances, it manages to outsmart your notions without losing momentum. With the use of rapid camera movements, mood music at the right points and coloured lighting, you feel like you're a part of a ferocious video game with that added bonus of intellectual stimulation. The three-disc collector's edition of Old Boy has some remarkable features, including five behind the scene documentaries, a couple of deleted scenes that are equally exciting and interviews with the cast and crew. There's also a 3-hour documentary called the 'Autobiography of Old Boy' that discusses the making of the film. The most interesting bit of the DVD is a small featurette titled 'Le Grand Pix at Cannes' that captures the response at the Cannes. Old Boy is not a revenge epic; it does not place any judgments, and yet I can guarantee you'll end the film with a few conclusions of your own. Maybe that wasn't the motive of the film. Maybe it was just meant to be a stylized, aggressive depiction of revenge and its effect on people. As the cliche goes, you'll get all that and much more. ]"
659,"[This is a country where the first attack of arthritis symbolizes aging. We dismissed my mom's menopause as random irritability. Making a big deal out of 'turning 30' is considered, at best, much ado about nothing. That does not make the problems facing the chic-urban-turning-30 any less important. Yes, they have it all, and they want more. And proudly so; even if they have to fight for it. In that sense Turning 30!!! could have been a very important film. But it turns out to be a drab narrative. You wait for the spark and you are kept waiting.I consider myself a part of the target audience, I'm city-bred, so what if I turned 30 a little while ago. I might not be as chic as her, but I have more than a friend or two who are like the women Turning 30!!! talks about. Yet Naina (Gul Panag) and her friends don't even remotely touch me. I'd have wanted to smile with their jokes, nod at their insights about love, life and everything that goes with it. I'd have loved to cry with them too, but I cringed after the first couple of times I saw Gul cry. There's only so much of a grown-up woman you can see crying, after all. The much talked about, and rightly so, Sex and The City hangover is as dreary and superficially profound as the original (go ahead, shoot me for killing your stereotype about all women liking SATC!) And yet, it wouldn't have been such a bore if it weren't so repetitive. Fortunately, the writer/director is very open about showing a woman's sexual urges. Hindi films have after all, always been too shy to express sensuality. That her lust goes hand-in-hand with how desperate her love gets is a slice-of-life for any woman in love - age no bar. I also liked the hand homosexuality is dealt. Right from how close friends initially react to their lesbian friend coming out to them to how the larger group reacts to how everyone comes to terms with it. Naina's struggle at work too is something that kept me going. It felt like the writer had some insight into a woman's aspirations at work; her frustrations with the macho men in her industry; and her struggle in getting what is rightfully hers. But, that too goes bust with a sorrily written climax. That's the story of the film's life. There were many things going right, but sooner or later, they go flat. Like a woman who's in her 60s is likely to say, celebrating or whining about a 30th is a thing-to-do by women who have it all and know nothing of real suffering and pain at the hands of their men. And this pain is physical versus the 'literal pain in the ass that her ex-boyfriend was', Naina is heard complaining about. But, that's for the 60-year old to say. We 30-Pluses had our chance and blew it. ]"
660,"[There's something about music from the bagpipes, isn't it? Think Mel Gibson's Braveheart and you can faintly recollect its sound. There's an amazing pathos in the notes it produces. Something which a film like Joyeux Noel (Merry Christmas) has in plenty. One of the remarkable features about watching Merry Christmas is that when the movie is on, there are scenes that scream out to you that this indeed is great cinema unfolding in front of you. I felt so the first time I watched it at the MAMI Film Festival some years ago, where the film received a standing ovation. On DVD, I not only relived that experience - I was moved to tears, yet again in many scenes - I also realised that this film has one of the finest messages about peace and humanity. Ideally, this movie should have released in India. In a country where J P Dutta's Border was such a success, Merry Christmas is blockbuster material. Based on a true story, the film is set during a Christmas eve in the first World War, when Scottish, German and French soldiers on the Western Front set aside their differences and declared ceasefire for one night to celebrate Christmas together. It's got a simple plot, but it is the moving screenplay and the a wonderful star-cast that makes the film so watchable. It also has one of the most uplifting background scores - it plays a crucial role in conveying the soldiers' emotions. Music, in fact plays a vital role in the film - it is what unites the soldiers and proves that no matter which country you're from, those notes emanating from the bagpipes and mouth organs can blur any dividing lines. And the story sets a fantastic example of religion - Christianity - acting as a great unifier, rather than a divide between people. The story also makes a strong point about European countries' culture and heritage, whose roots are more or less similar. The scale of how important the film is understood by the number of languages the film touches. There's English (with a heavy Scottish accent), German and French. The proximity of each of these countries is depicted through some wonderful interludes between the soldiers - someone knows a relative or two on the other side, letters are passed on, promises are made to visit them after the war, there are invitations to come over for a drink, compliments are passed about the others' wives and you witness all of this with a lump in your throat, because you sense that they may not survive this battle together. How will they get back to shooting at each other the next morning? That's the irony on which the storyline balances itself and sends out a strong message that despite being divided by man-made borders, humanity essentially has some simple needs - caring about our loved ones, wanting to be with our families during festivals and  the right to live a good life and get a decent funeral. Director Christian Carion, a Frenchman himself proves that he is a fine director of an ensemble starcast. That comprises of the outstanding French lieutenant Audebert (Guillame Canet), the Bishop Palmer (Gary Lewis) who doubles up as a doctor on the Scottish army camp, the suave Scottish chief Gordon (Alex Ferns) and the impressive Horstmayer (Daniel Bruhl), who's a Jew leading the German camp, but still celebrates Christmas with as much fervour as the others. There are two opera icons Sprink (Benno Furmann) and Anna Sorensen (Diane Kruger), who help give form to the cease fire, through their singing. It's a memorable watch and after you've seen it, there's a sense of fulfillment that very few movies are able to produce. 'I'm Dreaming of Home', the theme song is something you'll be humming long after the film is over.]"
661,"[Through most of The Secret of the Grain's 153-minute duration, you get a sense that there isn't a director to this film. There is a cameraman, invisible somewhere, and an editor with an intuition so perfect that he cuts this film, like none other. You, the viewer are an observer amidst the characters in the world of of the recently laid-off 61-year old Slimane's world. A world that's not a perfect family - Slimane is divorced. His ex-wife Souad complains about alimony payments not being on time and keeps him away from the family get-together every Sunday. His current wife Latifa and her daughter Rym love him and despite having to dodge some serious red tape in a quiet port town in France, he wants to start a restaurant on a boat. The main attraction at this new eatery: couscous, something which Souad cooks really well. At least on paper, the storyline unfolds like a family-drama with just the right layers to keep you engrossed. But being engrossed is an understatement. Director Abdellatif Kechiche's treatment of the script is such, that it makes you want to tear into the screen and make the characters stop howling, offer a shoulder to comfort them and at other times, even join their celebrations. Kechiche does this by shooting the characters through tight close-ups - there's a family get-together scene, for example, which has been shot and edited with such meticulous care and precision that the cacophony of chatter it generates is loud and real enough to make your neighbours feel you've got French guests in your house. Halfway through these scenes, I realised that I was smiling, not for any jokes being bandied about, but simply for the joy of being able to observe a family have a merry time together at a meal. In several scenes, it also appears that the director is also lenient with saying 'cut'. He lets the drama boil, the characters continue to bawl, argue and shout and as a viewer, you want him to end the scene and move on to the next one, but he doesn't. He lets it froth a little further, until you're holding your head in your hands, a bit awestruck at the performances and a bit disturbed with what just unfolded on screen. The delicacy of couscous plays a crucial role in the film. Comprised of grain, fish, vegetables and sauce, it is the staple diet of the minority community that Slimane and his extended family belong to. It is it's preparation that brings the extended family together, not just on weekends but also to work as one unit to get the new restaurant up and running. It becomes clear, that despite differences amongst people, food is therapeutic in bringing people together. The film, for most parts looks so real and believable thanks to its performances. I must mention Hafzia Herzi, who plays Rym, Slimane's daughter and puts in an incredible performance especially towards the end. It's the visual highlight of the film. There's Alice Houri, who plays Julia, a Russian married to Slimane's philanderer son Hamid, who gives the most incredible single-take bawling performance I've seen. Her outburst is so long and disturbing, I thought my nerves would burst. By thanking his father in the end credits of the film, The Secret of the Grain, seems autobiographical and one can't help but relate Slimane to Kechiche's own father. Habib Boufares, who plays Slimane, has a resigned look on his face throughout the film, but his determination to renovate a scrap boat and start a new business, is re-assuring, signifying that no matter how cold the war be between your present (Latifa and Rym) and past (ex-wife and family), with a little cajoling and effort, everybody comes together for fresh beginnings. That's a great thought to begin the New Year with, isn't it? Don't miss this film. PS: Happy New Year, folks!]"
662,"[Fair Game is inspired by the true events in the life of Valerie Plame. Though, how much of the movie is fact or fiction, is open for discussion, it gives the story a lot of juice. With Wiki-Leaks exposing many a cover-ups of the government agencies, the timing of Fair Game has been perfect. It exposes the controversial actions taken by the US government during the US-Iraq war.I've been a big fan of Frederick Forsyth's novels. He takes an incident or a political scandal and weaves a perfectly believable and entertaining piece of fiction around it. Though his novels have much more action and are quite fast paced as compared to this movie, Fair Game possesses the same blueprints of an entertainer.Doug Liman has provided us with some very entertaining spy-action films like the Bourne series and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith. But though the tag line of Fair Game reads - 'Wife. Mother. Spy', it is not an action film. If not more, they've given equal footage to her being a wife and mother, as they have given to her being a spy. You wont miss the action much though, as the intense drama keeps you hooked. Jez Butterworth (screenplay) has done his homework in translating the story of Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts) into an engaging script. Doug Liman's direction manages to keep you engaged, despite the sluggish pace of the story. The slow pace is required to give the lead actors (Naomi Watts and Sean Penn)  a touch of reality. Their characters grow, coping up to the drastic changes in their lives, and it is shown efficiently owing to their brilliant performances. These two have carried on where they left off in 21 Grams.If you're into politics, especially the US-Iraq war, you'd love this movie. And even if you're not, you can watch this one as pure fiction and love it for the powerful performances by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn. Catch on DVD for sure.]"
663,"[The Rey family moves into a house which, their nanny claims, is haunted. After a burglary they put up cameras as a caution and find unseen beings in the house. The entire movie is shown as shot through surveillance cameras, a feature that I loved. The concept is obviously not new, but gives the whole movie a really eerie feel. The repetition of shots and the build up of tension is good. But I was disappointed by the number of times that I was led to a state where I thought something intense would happen, and it turned out...well, not so intense. This movie is intense, but requires patience. As compared to the previous movie, this one is a little less horrifying. But that probably is because you expect something to happen all the time. It has the same skeleton as its predecessor, but the finishing is different. There is nothing new or surprising though. And every scene doesn't necessarily have something mystic happening. That comes in at the right time, and is effective in making you jump. Of course, you don't understand every bit of the story either. But the general look of the film is such that some of it needs to remain in confusion. As to explanations, obviously don't look for any - it'll leave you disappointed. What I didn't like was that, in a theatre you have college kids around, who will obviously comment and hoot at the wrong times, diluting the tension. How can you expect me to be scared when someone says in the middle of a bloodcurdling sequence, ""Grab the pan and hit the ghost, silly!"" I liked the way the day and night scenes of the same few places in the house are shown through the security cameras. Molly Ephraim (Ali) acted really well for a teenager. The adults were all fair in their performances, nothing commendable. I wonder how they got this child who plays Hunter to do all the crying. For those who have seen the first film, you might find this sequel a wee bit mild. But for those who haven't, these sequences will keep you thinking, and sure they'll keep you scared. To get a real feel of the terror, buy a DVD and watch at home. Alone. ]"
664,"[Just the manner in which Po Wing bends down towards Yui Fai to light a cigarette, just by the way one burning cigarette touches the tip of another, Wong Kar Wai (WKW) uses the most subtle touches between two ignited inanimate objects to describe flames of passion. Happy Together, known to many as a gay love story, has many such moments between Po Wing (Leslie Cheung) and Yui Fai (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) where emotions seem restrained, but WKW's touch of class gives each gesture immense depth. The story for most part, is that about loneliness and regret, than about the two protagonists being gay. There isn't really a supporting cast - and there's no attempt to reflect on the stigma of being homosexuals. The viewer is exposed merely into the world of its two protagonists - Po Wing and Yui Fai. We're not yet privy to their family stories or the battles they wage every day. If there is any sense of alienation, it is of being in a foreign country and longing for home. The director, however does introduce a new character in the second half of the film - Chang (Chen Chang), who works with Yui Fai at a restaurant. Chang and Yui Fai become close friends and although there are no gay undertones between them, WKW manages to establish his mastery at showing even platonic relationships between men, in the same film. Happy Togetheris an important film. Not just for its portrayal of two queer men, but also for its subtle treatment of romance. Scenes where a a very sick Yui Fai cooks for Po Wing, cleans his wounds, and refuses to let Po sleep with him are fine examples of a director who's mastered this art. I could sense tears rolling down my eyes when a lonely Yui Fai starts sobbing, when asked to record all his sorrows into a voice-recorder. The beauty of the Iguazu waterfalls, where the duo want to visit, is the most lasting image of the film. There could have been no better visual treat to capture the pathos in the relationship between Po Wing and Yui Fai. Throughout the film, WKW is experimental with his photography - there are the saturated hues, very typical of all his films, as are the monochromatic tones supported with close-ups, which magnify the state of mind of both characters. There's also the trademark WKW shot in the car with one's head resting on the other's shoulder and a walk through the streets late in the night - both of which he replicated in his subsequent film, In The Mood For Love. The colour palette - WKW's obsession with red - comes across in a major way as his camera flirts with a blood-stained floor at the abbatoir. Being able to spot these consistent patterns are some of the delights of reviewing a Wong Kar Wai film. The director is maintains his signature touches, themes of unfulfilled love and delicate expressionism. He doesn't shoot colourful people, or colourful sets, but his camera feeds colours into some very grey characters.Buy the DVD. It's one film you'll want to revisit again and again. Perhaps when you're lonely.]"
665,"[All of us have read the book, and I had loved it. That was because it led me through a lot of detailed voyages and outings of one Gulliver, and how his trip changed into a total adventure. This movie is a modern take on the same lines, only it's silly and boring. A common mail room man who goes to Bermuda for an assignment looses his way. He is a guy who is in the need of an ego boost, and ends up being the tallest man in a strange land of Lilliput. Oh and how he loves it, until something goes wrong. Add to that a little spice, because our guy is a simple jack who is good at heart and wants to help everyone. This movie is obviously about ""Every dog has his day"" and how you can make your day just by being confident.The story focuses mainly on Gulliver's adventure to Lilliput where the people are one-twelfth his size. Then there is a cameo at Brobdingnag, where people are twelve times the size of humans, and Gulliver has to live as a doll. Lack of right pace in the story puts this movie in the ""far below expectations"" list that I have. They rush through the build up, and prolong the twilight talks - I so don't categorize as adventurism. Jack Black was okay in his role, and definitely not as original as he was in School of Rock. Speaking of original, I think everything and everyone in the film was an imitation. Even Emily Blunt, who was cast as Princess Mary, seemed to be to fake - even as a blonde! But at the top was the direction, which did a really unintelligent imitation of a great story. It felt miserable to see one of my favorite books turn into bits and pieces of non-performance. Back to acting, the Lilliputian that Gulliver befriends in his initial days as a prisoner, Horatio - done right by Jason Segal, still refrains from playing an honest and convincing role. Sure they induced good stuff, like references to Titanic and Gavatar. But the film fails as a comedy, or even as a children's adventure. It is shot unrealistically. I mean, Jajantaram-Mamantaram was better! The 3D feels like a desperate attempt to attract audiences. Most of it is obviously shot with green screens.. And oh, how could I forget to mention the feeble attempt at humor... a serious put off! I almost went to sleep in the movie.  Children might see if they want, but would be better off if they did not. ]"
666,"[A viewer's state of mind is of utmost importance while watching a film. Drowsiness, exhaustion and fidgety company, are three factors that strongly influence opinion about a film. Their absence can make you feel that Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Three Monkeys is a masterpiece, and their abundance can put you to sleep. Indeed, Three Monkeys qualifies as the film institute specimen. Watch it on fast forward (not even 2x, try 4x) and you'll still know exactly what's happening. But if you really want to feel the film, and be part of the nervous tension flowing between the characters, you've got to sit through. I did - the first time I saw it on the big screen - and I was almost in a trance, absorbed deeply into the proceedings, however slow one might call them. The director, an accomplished still photographer himself, has such a fantastic command over the visuals that despite few dialogues, the emotions are loud and clear. The plot is simple - an aspiring politician Servet (Ercan Kesal) accidentally hits a pedestrian while driving along the highway on a rainy night. To shield his future in politics, he asks his employee Eyup (Yavuz Bingol) to take the blame and go to prison for six months. In return he promises to pay him a handsome compensation on return, in addition to his monthly salary to Eyup's family - Hacer (Hatice Aslan), wife, and son Ismail (Rifat Sungar). Servet, however, fancies Hacer and when she approaches him for the full compensation and it triggers an affair that soon snowballs into a web of lies between each of characters. It is from here on that each of them becomes one of the three monkeys, who see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil. The last 30 minutes of the film are perhaps the least verbose, but despite being so, Ceylan's direction has enough drama to convey each character's state of denial, conflict, jealousy and revenge. The film also makes some points to ponder over. It becomes clear that evil is never washed out completely - it can only be passed on. The miseries of one person, go on to the become the miseries of another. Money, lust and innocence are just pawns in the process. Ceylan makes use of static shots and long, disturbing silences which create a nervous tension flowing throughout the film. Emotions are rarely explicitly stated in the film, they're left to the viewer's interpretation. Although there's almost no background music in the film, the use of a simple ringtone on Hacer's phone - a Turkish song about love, loss and hurt - is used very cleverly to establish emotions. The cinematography is stunning - shot in HD, each frame seems like a work of art. There is a meticulous amount of detailing that goes in showing the effects of the Turkish summer on each character - perspiration, sweat and secrets become conniving bedfellows in the film. And the arrival of the monsoon, marks the passing away of evil.Three Monkeys is art-house cinema at its best. Watch it with some patience and focus. You won't be disappointed. It tells a good story with a lot of substance. And by being minimalist with dialogues, it proves successfully that silence can be louder than words.]"
667,"[Non-Hindi, black and white films - especially silent ones - often receive mixed reactions if you watch them on TV. I've lived with roommates - film enthusiasts all of them - and believe me, unless you're the true blue movie buff, a silent film is last on the 'must watch' list. Metropolis, made in 1927, is however no ordinary silent film. It shares two reputations - one, of being the most expensive silent film ever made. And two, of being Adolf Hitler's favourite film. But to really appreciate Fritz Lang's dystopian drama, you have to acknowledge the incredible amount of effort and global collaboration that has gone into making its most recent version on DVD. Edited parts of the film are patched together from South America, some parts in Europe and some are still lost in transit. Signs of it are visible in the film - for example, the text that flows between images sometimes appears in a different font. There are several abrupt cuts and it is easy to make out that certain sequences are compensated for with text. Fortunately, none of that doesn't take away the awe of watching Metropolis. Fritz Lang's technique to shoot the bustling metropolis amazed me and it is sheer genius to create a believable city using miniatures like that. There are floods, explosions, transformations, robots and more - and despite the absence of sophisticated technology for special effects, Lang makes a futuristic city look far more believable than Love Story 2050. Crowd movements for example, are so painstakingly shot that you realise how easy filmmakers have it today. The plot is almost Orwellian, but the message is not. The film unfolds like a science experiment. The point the film wants to make is stated at the beginning: ""The mediator between the mind and hands must be the heart."" It must have been a timely one then - almost a prophecy for an era when the Industrial Revolution had begun and the divide between the capitalists and working class was beginning to show. Which is why, the film is hailed as a classic - today, the gap between the rich and poor is the widest it has ever been. In the film, this gap is demonstrated using the upper city, which represents all the luxuries that a man could want - gyms, libraries, playgrounds; while the lower city (the depths), has the working class living in pure apathy. It's only when the city chief's (Joh Frederson) son Freder falls in love with a working class woman (Maria), that he realises that he must mediate the differences between his capitalist father (who runs the city) and its workers. The film has just the right amount of layers in its drama - there's tension between the father (Joh) and son, Freder; there's the scientist Rotwang who appears obedient to Joh, but has other tricks up his sleeve; and there's the Machine Man (a replica of Maria, only more menacing and evil) who does all things possible - including an erotic dance number - to destroy the unity of working classes. It's a silent film, but the actors on screen do enough with their expressions to break the language and sound barrier. Brigitte Helm, who plays Maria and the Machine Man, is the best of the lot. She seems divine as Maria, but her raised eyebrow look as Machine Man is, well, pure evil. Gustav Frohlich, as the saviour, Freder is impressive. Alfred Abel as Joh Fredersen, the capitalist tycoon is very unlike a silent film actor - he's not loud, yet a twitch of his facial muscles does more than a dose of invectives would. Rudolf Ken Rogge plays the mad scientist Rotwang to perfection.Some may interpret Metropolis as preachy, but I think it does so through an engaging story. It advocates themes of non-violence and responsible industrialization. If not for the message, watch this film to get some insights into what touches the mind of Adolf Hitler.]"
668,"[Every once in a while comes a film that clearly demarcates its success into extremes. It'll bomb at the box office and no more than a couple of years later you'll see it gaining immense cult status. Films like Blue Velvet, Reservoir Dogs and, closer to home, Andaz Apna Apna, failed at the box office but gathered fans through their home video releases. Some films are destined to be a bigger success through underground appreciation. If the filmmakers got a penny for every time someone highly recommended these films over a casual conversation, they'd be calling themselves James Cameron. And that's the beauty of watching a film like The Big Lebowski.Even though Fargo  and No Country For Old Men  are considered the gems, The Big Lebowski adds to their credit like a trigger. From the casting to the dialogues to the surrealistic depiction of what can only be summed up as being inside a stoner's head, the entire experience makes you go ""whaaaa?"" in a salutary way. The film surrounds Jeffery Lebowski (Jeff Bridges, also 2010's Best Actor Academy Award winner) or the Dude as he refers to himself and prefers everyone to refer to him as. He gets caught up in a series of events because he shares his name with a millionaire. All of it is hilarious because here's a bowling enthusiast who couldn't be happier smoking weed, drinking White Russians and calling himself a pacifist, who gets unnecessarily involved in a tumbling situation. Accompanying him are his two friends, John Goodman (Walter Sobchak), a Vietnam veteran and Donny (Steve Buscemi) his bowling mate. The best part about the film is the funny and edgy nature of the characters. Goodman is everything the Dude is not, with a violent temper and his willingness to settle everything with a gun. Donny is thick-headed and gullible, and they provide for admirable side characters for someone like the Dude. Apart from these three, you have Julianne Moore playing a feminist artist, Tara Reid playing a nymphomaniac wife, Philip Hoffman playing a secretary who acts as the mediator between the two Lebowskis and the sassiest of the lot, with his Italian mafia-esque accent and loud dressing, John Turturro. Referred to as Jesus, Turturro (one of the Coen brothers' stock actors) plays a bowling opponent to the Dude and his friends. Each character has been depicted with a hilarious background score, and all of them come together to make for a series of bizarre, amusing scenes. Also watch out for the cowboy narrator who refers to the story as some age-old legend, with epic characters. The special features on the DVD are not that exciting, apart from a set of photographs by Jeff Bridges and a 25 minute making of The Big Lebowski. Also featuring are short interviews with Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, and of course Coen staples Steve Buscemi and John Turturro. But if you need one reason to go buy the DVD, it is the fact that a whole religion has emerged out of a character from the film. Dudeism is now a full-blown religion, with Dudeist churches and priests spread across the US, all advocating The Dude's philosophy and lifestyle. Dude, now that is cult status!]"
669,"[A mysterious woman on a train coupled with mistaken identity of a tourist, definitely sounds interesting. Add to that inept cops and a cliched gangster with his Russian henchmen, and you have The Tourist. The plot looks intriguing in the trailer, but turns out to be extremely stupid. It is very slow, and is only about dialogues. The story is just a pick up from any silly thriller.  It is mostly predictable, because nothing happens in the movie! The only value is a very talented cast and the cinematography.There are zero adrenaline moments. The amount of focus on Elise (Angelina Jolie) made me think this would turn out to be something like a Hitchcock movie. But it was below expectations, even with all the flair. I always wonder why the cops in such movies are so stupid, and this one just adds to my curiosity. People  standing around passively when pistols are shot, makes the entire thing look unreal. The lack of real twists weighs down hard on the film's genre. Plus the physics of the action sequences are baffling. Almost all of them were unbelievable, and therefore irritating. And what should I say about the gangsters? Ah, losers.I was looking forward to the film for Johnny Depp. But sadly, he has nothing substantial to do in the movie. He is comical, and does have his own charm. But I am so used to seeing him playing quirky, character driven parts, that it feels very odd to see him play a normal role. Angelina Jolie sure looks ravenous  - I mean ravishing. She pulls off her role as a confident woman who doesn't like circumstances controlling her while manipulating a vulnerable tourist. Another thing I liked is that the film is not dark like other thrillers. The mood throughout the film is light, with a touch of comedy and a flicker of romance. The one-liners are enjoyable, though you'd have seen most of them in the trailer. Venice is made even prettier with the times of the day chosen to shoot her. Unhurried and verbose, the film is at the best mediocre. Jolie fans might like it since it has a lot of close-ups. Depp fans will find disappointment. Wait for a DVD if you really want to watch it. Else, you might as well give this one a pass. ]"
670,"[Three things strike you immediately when you take a look at the DVD of Despicable Me:1. The cover design is fantastic. 2. There are no special features on the DVD. 3. The sub-title of the film, 'Superbad. Superdad', pasted alongside a 'gru-some' looking man and three cute kids - almost gives the plot away.Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), an obnoxious inhabitant in a quiet neighbourhood, has an army of minions (egg-shaped characters with voices exactly like that of Vodafone's Zoozoos) and a mad scientist helping him steal famous monuments. Well, almost. One day, when the Pyramids get stolen by Vector (Jason Segel), a new villain on the block, Gru is intimidated and plans to make the ultimate robbery - shrink the moon and bring it to earth. To help him succeed, Gru adopts three orphaned kids - Margo, Edith and Agnes. Almost from the moment the kids enter Gru's life, the storyline gets extremely predictable. Several films, especially in animation, have gone down this pat. Monsters Inc., Ice Age are some examples that immediately come to mind. But despite knowing what to expect, Despicable Me is a fairly entertaining watch. This is Universal Studios' first 3D animated film and although it's not a Pixar product, the character design and animation is noteworthy. Some sequences - like the rollercoaster scene at the theme park - would look spectacular in 3D, nevertheless are enjoyable on DVD. But Gru's unique character piqued our curiosities the first time we saw the trailers and for many, that took us to the theaters too. Carell is fantastic as Gru and one can't help but marvel at the immense work that must have gone behind getting the French accent right. So Gru does not sound like Steve Carell, rather it is the other way around. By any standards, that's an achievement in voiceovers - something we marvelled at when we saw Robin Williams skillfully do it in Mrs Doubtfire. Writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul more or less succeed in showing Gru's desperation to go to the moon, through his flashbacks to childhood. The humour in the film has a pattern - the antics of the minions are slapstick, while the kids, especially Agnes (Elsie Fisher) generate 'awww' moments with every line. Given the basic plot, parents will find certain scenes very easy to relate to mainly because of some parenting lessons Gru learns along the way. The closing sequence brings a smile to your face for simple joy it gives to celebrate the character of Gru. He looks, well... erm...disproportionate, but when in good company, he can dance really well. Later, if you nitpick your brain as to why Despicable Me didn't floor you completely, there's an important realisation. Animation films have clearly set the bar so high in quality entertainment, that not every film is going to match up (Many are trying, that's a good thing.) But it would be fair to say that without drawing too many comparisons, Gru and the kids' antics are far better value for money than most movies that released this year.]"
671,"[Megamind is fun, humorous, entertaining and a very smart film. It takes the best from movies like - The Incredibles, Shrek &amp; Despicable Me, and presents before us an unlikely hero. A hero we grow to love. It follows the current trending theme that sometimes the bad guys make the best good guys. In addition, Megamind gives a lot of depth to its main character. It also carries some deep messages. It reflects on us about how easily we decide on making someone a hero and some one else a villain without trying to know the person better. How we banish everything that is a little different from our liking, a little - odd, without caring for the consequences it might bear. The movie manages to convey all that in style and humour that makes every minute of it a joy to watch. Every great superhero needs a great super-villain. This movie explores the reverse theory that every great villain needs a superhero to oppose him too. And when there is none, evil gets bored, and there are little things more dangerous than an empty mind.The voice-overs are superb. Will Ferrell and Tina Fey have done an outstanding job. Brad Pitt is excellent in his relatively small stint in the movie. And Jonah Hill manages to pull of a dorky voice quite well. Apart from the background score, I also loved the selection of classic hit songs of the 70s and 80s. They couldn't have been used better and added a lot of mischief to the characters. Its everything you could ask for in a family/kids entertainer.The movie is nothing you haven't seen before. But, it is a beautiful compilation of the best parts from your favourite movies. Its a Christmas treat to watch with your family and have some unadulterated fun. ]"
672,"[You can see how Rajshri Productions is struggling to keep up with the times. They are trying hard to catch up with the generation that is absolutely comfortable with the use of the f-word and the s-word. But their discomfort is transparent because they want to stick to their kind of cinema. This time around, their solution to the clash of the generations is mutual respect. A back-answering rebellious youth is told to age a little quicker and look at it from an older person's point of view. The more experienced, thus wiser are applauded when they give their children a chance at living life king size. All this might be possible without lectures (no filmmakers, masking them as songs doesn't make them any less patronizing) and ""tubelight""  moments turned into dramatic realizations. But not in the Barjatya world. Their characters are saccharine-cute and coy even as they are reborn into more glamorized, more ""modern"" avatars. Rajnandini, the protagonist transforms into RJ, but where will the sweetness that she is born with go? These sugar-coated, wordless (spineless?) girls do exist. Hell, yours truly, this marwadi, ""city-girl"" might have given a cousin or two a run for her money, when it came to blind obedience. I even did the dreadful CA! I wouldn't be surprised if we found a specimen or two like me even today. That is why I think Isi Life Mein doesn't work at all. It was so easy for me to identify with mute Rajnandini, but I didn't. Sandeepa Dhar, who plays Rajnandini, has a lovely chemistry with Akshay Oberoi too. But the narrative just falls flat. There is no pique point. When characters are subdued and willing to take life lying down, there is only so much the audience can root for. Sure, it happens in real life, but then again, that real life is boring too. The only points of interest are the choreographed pieces of the improvised The Taming of the Shrew. The college romance was cute but it didn't grow on me.A misfit in the 00s despite being relevant, Isi Life Mein is as much an irony as it is a shame. How I wish someone could add more spunk to the subject and bring it on yet again. ]"
673,"[Superficially Mirch is a collection of short stories with an underlying theme of adultery. But while throwing the theme of shameless betrayal on you face, it covers a lot of ground. We are scandalized by the sexually expressive female characters, who rightly call themselves 'bitches'. This shock itself is an example of how inappropriate we think it is for our women to articulate their sexuality, let alone use or act upon their needs. The short stories are replete with sarcasm on the hypocrisy inbuilt in a man-woman relationship - mythology or modern. The double standard also subtly creeps in the audience's mind. For example, without taking offense (I'm a woman and all that), I started making character judgments about the women. Though they were smart and thought on their feet, they were ace-class calculative. Only suddenly, Ruchi (Shahana Goswami) remarks that the stories are pro-women. And it struck me, all the men in the film were equally manipulative. Only their scheming doesn't come into the fore because ...because of what? Stereotypes about men allow them to be devious? Lead ladies are hardly ever portrayed as conspiring in films, unless they are vamps? That's how slyly the film makes you think. The characters argue amongst themselves on our behalf. They shhusssh possible criticism by bringing up objections against the four shorts themselves. The others make counter-arguments. Usually, I get annoyed when films do that. Justify its faults by saying them out loud. But, it slid by here. Mainly because of the content of the shorts. And they had to do something to connect the four dots, right? On the side, Mirch also talks about the struggle of a writer who wants to differ from the standard. In fact, the underlying theme that wit can get you places, applies to this side-plot too. Deftly, writer Maanav (Arunoday Singh), textures his stories in accordance with the producers demands. And while making all these points Mirch is fun to sit through. It could've solely stood tall on the clever stories. But lovely performances and to-the-tee casting only add to the entertainment quotient. I thoroughly enjoyed the colors used to accentuate and differentiate the mood of the setting. The lively colors in the Panchatantra short stories are in complete contrast with the browns and blues in the modern stories. And these are set against the black and whites hues in the connecting segments. Similarly the narrative is lyrical and musical in the folklore portions but is sort-of stone-hearted and harsh for the modern stories. One of the nagging issues with any film that has a few absolutely unconnected parts put together is flow. The connection should not look forced. Mirch just about passes that hurdle. The other bigger concern is the climax. And the conclusion here slithers by like a snake. Left me with a smile and a few questions that I was happy they left unanswered.  Despite the sexual undercurrent, none of the shorts are erotic. They aren't vulgar, but they aren't beautiful either. They made me uncomfortable in the ""too much of one thing makes one sick"" sense. But, that was while watching the film. While walking out, the other things the film was pointing at came one after the other. There was also this pesky question, ""by liking this film am I subscribing to the fact that sex sells?"" :DAlso, while walking out, I overheard a couple. After a longish silence - He - Thinking about the movie, no? She - Goodness, this is going to make everyone suspicious. He - It's a movie one should watch alone. The couple was thinking and discussing. And it struck me - the film also warns you not to get complacent about your relationship. ]"
674,"[You know you're in for a treat when you see the title credits roll for Bimal Roy's Madhumati. There's Roy, the director; Ritwik Ghatak, the story writer; Hrishikesh Mukherjee, the editor; and Salil Chowdhury, the music director. On paper, it is one of the most lethal combination of Bengali biggies in a solitary film.The film is perhaps the first Indian film to deal with the theme of re-incarnation in a romantic setting. I'm not surprised. It's a very Hinduvian love story - timeless love after all, is meant to last through seven births, when solemnized through marriage. After 50 years this film is a classic is because despite many films exploring the theme (Karz, Karan Arjun, Hamesha, Om Shanti Om), the story still seems convincing, with a fair amount of leap of faith. I truly believe that most well-made films are those that are difficult to spoof, and I'd consider Madhumati as one amongst them. If you're from the post 1970s generation as I am, the film's progress makes you go through a particular cycle of emotions. It begins with admiration - at the extremely handsome Anand (Dilip Kumar), whose mannerisms and charm are complimented by the beautiful hillside locales where Madhumati is set. You then proceed to respect - at the detailed characterisation, not just for the leading starcast, but also for the supporting cast. There's Anand whose skills as a painter are well-intentioned, later coming in handy not just to woo his lover, but also at the climax of the film. Ugranarayan (Pran), the owner of a timber estate where Anand is employed appears as if he was born to be despised. And there's the beautiful village belle Madhumati (Vyjayanthimala) whose beauty is almost one with the scenic hills. (In addition to the scriptwriters, I'd give much credit to Lata Mangeshkar for Madhumati's characterisation. 'Aaja re...pardesi' is the ultimate paean beckoning a lover.) Ghatak's setting of the film seems just right, and his description of the village, its people and their history, has enough intrigue in it to let you know that, while the hills may appear beautiful on the outside, all's not well when you probe deeper. It's exactly the friction one needs for the love story to unfold and that's where Ugranarayan plays villian. Your respect for the film, is followed by awe - towards Ghatak and Roy - for pulling off the first film about re-incarnation, in the history of Indian cinema. Although mythology and religion are deeply rooted in Indian culture, it must have been challenging for the film-makers to produce this on a commercial scale. It is however, the biggest commercial success of all of Roy's films - his other films have a deep social fibre running through them e.g Do Bigha Zameen (highly socialistic), Parakh (satire, democracy), Sujata (untouchability) and Parineeta, Devdas (class divide). Thankfully, by the time the film ends, you're sure that despite some Red Chillies making an Om Shanti Om out of it, it is Madhumati which has more soul to it. ""They can beat you up, they can torture your body, but they cannot touch your soul,"" seems true. I cannot explain enough how important a role the film's music plays in the film. This is Salil Chowdhury's best work. 'Suhaana safar aur yeh mausam haseen' (Mukesh), 'Zulmi sang ankh ladi' (Lata Mangeshkar), 'Chadh gayo papi bichua' (Lata Mangeshkar, Manna Dey), 'Jungle mein mor naacha' (Mukhesh) and 'Aaja re pardesi' (Lata Mangeshkar) are not just timeless classics, but they play an invaluable role in heightening the film's commercial and aesthetic sensibilities. 'Aaja re pardesi' for example, is more haunting than the sound of creaking doors, hooting owls and repetitive shots of the full moon going under the  clouds - each of which have become cliches of films that have an element of spook in them. Madhumati deftly combines the concept of timeless romance, re-incarnation, class discrimination and feudalism in producing something that stays long with you after the film is over. It is a film that so proudly sits on the fence of being a romance, a tragedy and ghost story, a feat rarely achieved. I watched the film on the newly launched Poster Series by Shemaroo. It's a fabulous concept, where you get the replica of the original film poster, free along with the DVD pack that has the digitally mastered version of the original film. I wish there would be more DVDs like these.]"
675,"[Kevin Flynn created a video game 20 years ago. His son Sam, finds out that the cyber universe that his father created has become much more than just a video game. Tron: Legacy has some superb action and the special effects are amazing too. I especially loved the design of the bikes and cars, and interior of buildings. Although the entire movie isn't 3D, those sequences on the Grid, some of which lasted only a few moments, are spectacular and take the cake. The storyline is quite interesting if you don't know anything about the earlier Tron (1982). After watching the earlier version, the concepts are clearer and I could connect the dialogues better. So, if you haven't seen Tron(1982) yet, I suggest you do your homework before you watch Tron Legacy. It is amazing how young Jeff Bridges (Clu) and Bruce Boxleitner (Tron) look! Bridges is fantastic in the film. He dominates, not because of more screen time which is given to him, but because of the powerful performance that he has brought in. Garrett Hedlund starts of very well, but his performance is overshadowed by other characters, as the movie proceeds. Olivia Wilde puts up a decent performance as Quorra, and looks great. Michael Sheen (David Frost of Frost/Nixon) does a small but admirable job with his cunning character, something that only he can pull off. The basic story is mediocre. It is quite uncomplicated and that makes me dislike the writers. The focus is clearly on the special effects, which more or less makes up for the other faults. The only disappointment, and big at that, are the non-action parts. The characters just sit around and talk, which made me impatient, almost bored. Also, a couple of sequences were ridiculous, and that there was no way something like this could logically happen even in a gaming world. Dramatizing did go a little over the top, but that can be dismissed in the end as a necessary evil.The film runs with a consistently different look throughout, but what is a gaming world which does not look peculaiar? Lack of colour deserves a huge thumbs up, it really makes the film look like it was shot in a different world. It's funny how much the gaming world is made to have human world aspects, for example emotions. Programs shouldn't understand anything but logic, right? But of course, I am making analogy to Star Trek - my bad. Costumes were amazing, and what with all the light! Camerawork is decent. Sound track is good, but even better is the sound and light harmony. And thank God there is no cyber romance.No, this is not like Matrix, so don't think too much. Enjoy the action and cyber universe, which is rich in music and entertaining. Watch for sure, in 3D if possible. ]"
676,"[Driver (The Rock) is out to avenge his brother's murder while a Killer and a Cop are chasing him. With a regular pace, this one is a stereotypical revenge movie. The narrative is linear and the director hasn't even attempted to induce depth or leave it to the viewer to derive any meaning out of the movie. The story spells out notable  points,, some of which irritated me because I could predict where they were going to take me. The script is something you or I could have come up with. The movie doesn't do justice either to its name or to its genre. Not a single scene could be called 'Faster', and there is hardly any real action in the entire movie. Lot of killings - yes, but all of them were as simple as crushing ants (and no wrestling at all?!!). The lesser than expected number of gun fights made it a flat action film. The plot isn't convincing enough to be a great thriller, definitely not for an audience who is used to the likes of The Departed. I could have done with more of ""Killer"", because it'd be great to see the reason for the character's existence! Though Rock looks great with all the muscle, his acting and expressionless face make me wish wrestlers didn't change professions. Even a finer tuned character would have made me feel better. The director reserved few dialogues for Rock, and terse at that, but then that is a two-sided coin. At least they didn't make it worse by forcing too many too-good-for-him lines on him. There is more character to the Cop than the lead, but Billy Bob Thornton is a fine actor who is wastedhere. Oliver Jackson-Cohen plays Killer (and looks killer!), but he is a kid who has much to learn. This is a case that proves that non-Bollywood directors also shove in scantily clad hot-looking women with no significant roles to attract audiences. A lot of the movie seems like a waste of the makers' energy, like the emotional scenes that they tried to heave in more than once for random unnecessary push in stories. Although on the better side, the movie is not just about mindless killing. It does have some story, and a climax that could partly surprise you. Watch if you have nothing better to do.]"
677,"[It's difficult to resist a DVD that has Christopher Nolan, Al Pacino and Robin Williams to its credit. Both Memento and Following, Nolan's earlier films, are ambiguous and experimental. On a different note, Insomnia is a psychological thriller about the murder of a teenage girl in Alaska. Before watching the film, I had prepped myself for a mind-bending experience. And I was slightly off the mark. Insomnia's not a jigsaw puzzle. It's a rather straightforward plot, with linear narration. But even with the simplicity, you see the layers. Once you move beyond the plot of the film, you can identify a cinematic style that provides a benchmark for his later films. Before you can start typecasting the film as a regular nail-biter, the first 15 minutes of the film introduces you to mood lighting, intercutting visuals and hallucinatory images. David Julyan's background score is haunting and provides a sense of pace to the film. All of these elements make you think about the similarities in his directorial approach.  If you're one of those who watched the Batman series and Inception before watching his earlier films, you'll realize that somewhere Insomnia, becomes a stepping-stone for Nolan. It subtly marks his mysteriously layered, hair-raising style of telling a story, which is seen in abundance in his later movies. Insomnia is Nolan's first big Hollywood film, under Warner Brothers in 2002. It's a remake of a Norwegian film that was released in 1997 starring Stellan Skarsgard, from Good-Will Hunting. Hillary Seitz's grabbing screenplay is coupled with perfect casting. Robin Williams plays a creepy, almost psychotic writer and Al Pacino plays the battered down detective with immense conviction. You almost want to pat him to sleep every time you see him battling with Insomnia. Pacino's character faces a moral conflict through the film which causes him to lose sleep and that's when you notice the crafty subtext of the film. Apart from the run and chase plot, the narrative also carries with itself the motifs of defining good and evil. Nolan is known to have such characters in his film, who toe the moral lines with so much fervor, you can see yourself standing there with them. The special features on the DVD make it a valuable purchase - two commentaries, one is by director Christopher Nolan, while the other is a scene-specific affair with actress Hillary Swank, production designer Nathan Crowley, editor Dody Dorn, cinematographer Wally Pfister and screenwriter Hillary Seitz. In Nolan's commentary, he goes through each scene as they were filmed in detail. Watch out for the 14-minute conversation with Al Pacino and Nolan where they talk about movies, filmmaking and their respective careers. The rain-drenched setting of a small town in Alaska is extremely significant. As if the silence of the town is hiding secrets of many such murders, many such instances. Pacino is brilliant, as is expected, and Insomnia makes you feel like you're walking through the narrative, trying to figure out how Pacino manages the intelligent swiftness without any sleep.  It's the perfect film for a lazy afternoon watch, to motivate yourself to get up and kick your senses. ]"
678,"[The USP of The Warriors Way is gory action between Ninjas and Cowboys. With Cowboys and Aliens just around the corner, I thought all my prayers are about to be answered. For years, fans have been fantasizing about mixing two or more cults. Firefly and Cowboy Bebop are excellent examples of Space Cowboys and Blood - The Last vampire had Samurai vs Vampires. There are plenty more examples to cite - some lesser known than others. Now that Hollywood is experimenting by mixing things up, I was super-excited about The Warriors Way. I am extremely disappointed.The movie has all the tools to become a cult-blockbuster. It has an excellent cast in Dong-gun Jang (Korean superstar) as the rogue Ninja (also, the best swordsman in the history of mankind) and Geoffrey Rush as a reformed bandit (also, an ace-shooter of a cowboy). The film is produced by Barrie M. Osborne of The Lord Of The Rings franchise. Not much could have gone wrong. Correction: Not much 'should' have gone wrong. But a lot did. And the fault lies with the script by Sngmoo Lee and the screenplay. I can't pick which is worse. The flashbacks come out of nowhere. The climate changes with every swing of the sword. It feels like they were really trying hard to make it a senseless flick.The first five minutes of the movie took away all the built-up excitement as they attempt to be humorous amidst gory action sequences. So you begin to think, okay its going to be one of those ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (classic Cowboys vs Vampires) kind of movies. But then the movie becomes serious, and only manages to be unintentionally funny. Some of the action sequences are really well done though. I loved the last twenty minutes or so of the movie. I also loved the fact that the movements of Ninjas is quite close to those in animes (like Naruto). But visual perfection only makes up so much for everything else that's just mediocre. You are still sitting through the shoddiest screenplay ever, and some pathetic acting by the supporting cast. Who doesn't want to see Ninjas and Cowboys fight it out? So, I know you're keen. But save your money, and wait for a DVD/TV release. Bonus: You can fast forward to the good parts and skip all the sad-drama in the middle.]"
679,"[Possibly the most discussed and debated films this year, and a clear favourite at the Oscars, Inception arouses a strong urge to get into the mind of Christopher Nolan, in a similar way one wanted to get into the mind of the Wachowski brothers after watching The Matrix. Once inside, you want to ask him a simple question, ""How the hell did you think of something like this?""The story is unique and the arguments that Inception puts forward about dreams, reality and the human sub-conscious are almost entirely convincing. Nolan mounts the premise with edge of the seat thrills, gravity defying action and an ensemble of interesting characters, each of whom brings something unique to the table. Inception  tells the story of Dobb (Leonardo Di Caprio), a skilled extractor of valuable secrets that dwell in the subconscious of the human brain, who has to finish one last assignment before he can meet his kids. Cobb's technique is called extraction: entering a person's dream, and stealing an existing idea during his vulnerable dream state. His latest assignment however is a challenging one, called inception, where he has to plant an idea, rather than steal it. Dobb is however challenged with his past which he must confront and conquer in his dreams, to be able to pull of this task. Leonardo is convincing as Cobb, as is the team he assembles. Ellen Page, who plays the architect Ariadne, responsible for creating the world of the dream, almost sleeps through her role (no pun intended). Joseph Godron Lewitt plays Arthur, and makes a fine transition from being chocolate boy to Dobb's suave partner in crime. The big surprise is Marion Cotillard, who plays Mal, and is a formidable nemesis to Cobb. She's graceful, her eyes are deceptive and it doesn't take long for you to dislike her character. Tom Hardy, who plays Eames, uses his charisma to good effect, delivering some of the best lines in the film. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is responsible in a big way for maintaining the constant state of tension throughout the film. There's fear, desperation, doom, helplessness, exhilaration, satisfaction - only a genius can induce such versatility in a common theme through music. In its conclusion, Nolan ties up all loose ends, not that there are many, since the narration is linear, devoid of too many flashbacks or experimental jumps in the screenplay. He also takes great care in simplifying the idea of inception for the layman. Cobb's explanation of dreams and architecture to Ariadne is spectacular, clearly one of the visual highpoints of the film. In Cobb's references to ideas and their significance of them, Nolan touches upon a bigger issue - the theft of an idea, an intellectual property over which humans are yet to exercise their copyrights. Some say that geeks will eventually rule the world. My feeling is that only the geek with the right firewalls to his brain will. Why, another film that released this year,The Social Network is about a lawsuit over the theft of an idea. Inception also made me ponder over why human beings change their mind, after having decided on something. Why is it, that when presented with an idea that's immediately not acceptable, do we say, ""It's okay. Let's sleep it over."" What exactly happens in our sleep, that has the potential to change the way we feel about something, the morning after? And if not, what helps us keep our first impressions intact? Inception is a significant film in Nolan's career, as he proves that acclaim for The Dark Knight was no flash in the pan. With this film, he has cemented his place alongside the likes of Spielberg, Cameron, Scorcese. The fact that he's much younger than each of them gives cinegoers a great future to look forward to. One of reasons I was keenly looking forward to the DVD of this film, was to hear Nolan's thought process while shaping the story, converting it into the film, and convincing the folks at Warner Bros. to back it. Unfortunately, the DVD, despite being a two-disc set, does not give me any answers. The special features on the additional disc, do not have a ""Behind the Scenes"" either. There is not even a detailed interview with the film-maker, cast and crew, reactions from the producers as to what they thought when they heard the film's story for the first time. Fans of Nolan would have clearly wanted to see much more of him. Inception certainly commands at least a second viewing. I've seen it thrice, and I've been able to spot something new in each of those occasions. In its first viewing, the film seemed to be a story about a mind-heist, that introduced a rather radical but believable invasion of dreams. The second viewing, made it seem more to be a story about a man's struggle to get back home to his kids. The third viewing (which happened on DVD), convinced me that security of our subconscious may not be such a radical concept after all. But what worried me more, was the realisation, that in each viewing, we're cheering for inception, a robbery, which Cobb says ""is not strictly speaking, legal"". We live in strange times.]"
680,"[In the midst of pure chaos, there is a man with a purpose who wants to commit suicide. He has a point to make. And he makes it too. The only problem is the audience is mere human. It is impossible for us to ignore the ado and pay attention to his meek voice. I didn't go about looking for logic, I know the genre and I know my dislike against it. I try to balance it out by telling myself, ""enjoy it for what it is."" But, how do you enjoy a slapstick that doesn't make you smile even once? How do you let your hair loose when you are trying you best to keep your hands away from tearing them apart? How do you get yourself interested in the acting versus background score competition for loudness? I'm told these are the things that define the genre. But to me, it looks like a last ditch effort by all involved to milk whatever star-power they have in their waning years. And that's a shame because no one from the cast - from Anil Kapoor to Neetu Chandra need to do this. They surely have better things to do. Or at the very least, each one of them surely has a better way of making a fool of themselves. Geez, Sushmita Sen goes all double personality and screechy on you for goodness sake! I'm told that you are supposed to laugh at the silliness. I would have if it were really that silly. Every time something super-silly happens on screen there is an attempt to justify it and give it some credibility. The struggle between logic and ludicrous is won by inane with a headache thrown in as an extra. A quick example - everyone is South Africa, yes including locals, understands and speaks Hindi. And just when you are preparing your snide remark about it a character says to the other, ""He hasn't learnt English, but he has taught everyone in his village to speak Hindi!"" Why bother? You are right. Why do I even bother.Every once in a while there is a movie for which I just feel like writing a one-liner asking you to not watch the movie and finish it off. This was one of them. But I impose upon myself the duty to explain why I want to keep you away from the film. I feel responsible. Now only if the film-makers felt a fraction as responsible.]"
681,"[Sure, Band Baaja Baaraat is the same old story. The lead lady is a woman of essence, who takes on the world face up but you can't miss the gaping need for a man in her life. The male lead is yet another confused young man, who is a symbol of the talented but directionless youth. For newbies working together on a business, they hardly go through a struggle. Everything is laid out for her all too easily. YET you warm up to them.  You feel a shimmer of happiness for them when they are together. You want to tell them off for being silly when they are fighting with each other. I detested Band Baaja Baaraat's overall escape to over-simplicity and I loved it for the slight details of an every-day relationship. ""falling in love"" is beneath her, that's what regular girls do, not Shruti (Anushka Sharma). And yet, she savors special moments she has spent with her friend. She is modern and simple-minded. And yet, this doesn't come across as contradictory. Bittoo (Ranveer Singh) hasn't thought much about his aspirations. All he knows is he doesn't want to join his family business. Whatever keeps him away from that becomes his aspiration. Her rule for life becomes his rule, without a rhyme or reason. Because that's how he is. And things pretty much stay that way. She remains adamant and foolhardy. He doesn't budge from his foolish self. Their misunderstanding or bickering is commonplace in real life. Which is why, their actions and reactions are from your standard boy meets girl story, but they don't seem out of place. The same simple-headedness mars the film too. The agonizing conflict in the film doesn't hit hard enough because the heavy ""business"" set-up. Business mixes with pleasure. The set-up is all about Shruti's business, but the conflict arises elsewhere. Yet, you are interested in what's going on because of some very witty dialogues delivered with just the attitude the characters are meant to portray. Neither Anushka nor Ranveer have ""screen presence"". They could both look their best and deliver the most endearing lines, and I could very well be enjoying it without looking at them but observing the props in the background. And this works in their favor. Band Baaja Baaraat leaves a warm feeling without any overt stylization or grand charisma. In fact, Ranveer's pictures in the promo posters make him look like the roadside romeo, a girl would avoid looking at. And that's how he is in the film. Either this is perfect casting or a brilliant performance or ofcourse an intelligent blend of the two, only his next few films will tell. Though Anushka is a couple of movie old, this is her first one with no ""star""-backup. A couple more roles where she has a role with substance like this one and I think we'll have something to look forward to every time she picks a script. You hear of a movie titled Band Baaja Baaraat produced by the best marriage scene creators in the market, Yash Raj Films and apprehension builds into a cringe. You go into the theater expecting a garish set-up with an over-zealous background score. The first few scenes are of a texture so different from your expectations that you have no choice but to sit-up and notice. It's not gloss, it is the ruggedness of a street. The street is soon decorated but in an earthy, believable fashion. Are we seeing Yash Raj turn over a leaf in its hunky-dory, big, fat wedding environment? There is a glimpse. If not in anything else, in their new venture's awesome logo film. (I tried to look it up but couldn't find it. It plays before Band Baaja Baaraat starts. I'll update this space if I locate and leave me a link if you find it. Thanks!)]"
682,"[It's with some skepticism I allowed my mother to sit through a film, which has the reputation of having one of the most famous torture scenes in cinematic history. (Some Priyadarshan films are also torture...more on that later.)Mom reads English slowly and doesn't catch all subtitles, but it is clear that Audition has enough in it visually to leave her disturbed. When she woke up next morning, she complained, ""What a terrible film you showed me last night. You should not watch these kinda films!"" But then, she'd said the same thing while watching The Exorcist and I've stopped heeding her advice ever since then. Good horror and gore is awesome. A genuinely scary film generates nervous smiles and laughter amongst its viewers. Despite not stating itself at the outset as a 'horror film', Takashi Miike's Audition, has plenty going for it to make you squirm. In 1999, when it was screened at various film festivals, Audition gained a reputation of being a film that witnessed walkouts by members of the audience. Whether this genuinely happened or it was a publicity-driven rumour, is unknown, but after having seen Audition on DVD, I'm not surprised they did. The plot, despite being a feminist revenge fantasy, is wafer thin. Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), a widowed TV producer pretends to be Auditioning young women for a new show, when in fact he's really looking for a wife. He finds a demure, young candidate attractive, but as the film progresses, he comes face to face with her suspicious past. Director Takashi Miike uses a mixture of gore and realism to good effect, often teasing the viewer using Aoyama's dreams. Thankfully, he doesn't portray it all as a casting couch and Aoyama's character is not that of a producer lusting after a young woman, but instead, simply of that of a person genuinely wanting someone to spend his life with. Nevertheless, when he sits down to audition, Miike's opinion of the current casting process in cinema becomes clear. ""Man, I feel like a criminal,"" says Aoyama. Miike's casting of Asami (Eihi Shiina), the prospective actress, is spot on. Her submissive self, clean as it may seem, makes her the last person you'd trust with having a suspect background. Her character - aptly described in her application form for the acting assignment - provides the right amount of intrigue for Aoyama to notice her, among the numerous other contenders who turn up for the audition.The writing has several highpoints, especially during the climax, where it depends more on Asami's lines for chills rather than simply gory visuals. It makes the climax full of several ""facepalm"" moments. All this, despite not resorting to 'creaky doors', 'monster under your bed' and 'curtains and the wind' horror. Miike proves that psychologically traumatised characters are far more effective at sending a chill down your spine, rather than loud, thumping background scores and mutilated corpses. Instead, the story breaks new ground by mounting its horror on the 'what-ifs' and 'could have been', rather than 'what is'. What Miike leaves the viewer to guess, is whether things would have turned out the way they do, if Aoyama was really looking to cast an actress. Audition has all the elements that have come to characterise Japanese horror cinema - long-haired actress dressed in a white gown with her head bent low, a troubled history of characters, jump cuts, and the absence of a background score that is intended solely to scare. All of them have been symbolic of Japanese horror through the noughties, a time when Hollywood has been facing a writers' block in producing original and genuinely scary films.Watch it once, when you're alone.]"
683,"[When I say excessive use of slo-mo, I don't mean it lightly. ONLY scenes with dialogue reach you at normal speed. All else is in super-slow motion. And there aren't too many dialogues in the first place. I'm not saying I want more dialogues, just trying to warn you that almost 85% of the film is in slow-motion. Oh and first 20-25 minutes are a recap of the first episode. The good thing is you become a more patient person at the end of these 2.5 hours. To lend you support is a story with enough meat to do the rounds. The birth and death of crime are a never-ending circle, especially crime that is fuelled by revenge - be it in a small village in Andhra Pradesh or a nameless society. Whatever the case, it's high time the people involved step out of the circle to see the sunshine - is what Ram Gopal Verma tried to say in Rakht Charitra Part 1 and continues to do so in part 2, only with more conviction. There are actions and reactions based on defined characters. When some characters see murder as the one and only solution for any kind of problem, you see with more clarity (compared to part 1) that these people haven't known any other way. They are not politicians to judge pros and cons, they are just driven by an ego that bears the tag of a fanatic. The story also did away with a few characters that were annoying in part 1 - Any mention of Bukka (even in the recap) and the lady police inspector were conspicuous by their absence. This convinces me even more that  Bukka's meaningless violence, which was so prominent in Part 1, was absolutely gratuitous. The women too gain some respect, they have and speak their mind. They also give some brilliant performances. And so does...ahem...Vivek Oberoi, ditto for Suriya. I would have liked to see more of the Inspector Mohan character, but he just walked in and out as Suriya's inner voice/soul. I think these acts were accentuated because of the slow-motion too. I don't know if it's an illusion of some kind, but the close-ups and slow-motion combination give an impression that the actor has held on to one expression long enough for me to appreciate it. Damn! I already mentioned the slo-mo dramatizing everything. Saying it here will tantamount to repetition, right? I'm tempted to say here that with Bukka's role cut out and the slow-motion done in regular speed here (even half the number of times) would have easily made one good film. Synergy any one? Or is that Cinergy?Never mind, there's always the camerawork in RGV films to complain about. This time the camera does circles - no, not the standard horizontal ones, vertical ones. For good 20-25 seconds at a stretch, with no rhyme or reason. The first time, I almost thought something had gone wrong with the relay.  * ""An eye for an eye, makes the whole world blind."" Been there, seen that. Way too many times. Next. Oh wait, the climax here does leave a door open for a part 3. ]"
684,"[Phas Gaye Re Obama absolutely delivers on the sarcastic wit that the title implies. Satire runs in every dialogue and situation of the film. Unfortunately though, alongside the smart quips is also the oh-so-unnecessary slapstick. What could have been a classy comedy becomes yet another toilet-humor fest. It is brilliant, however, that despite going the crude route every once in a while, the story doesn't shift focus from its basic plot. A slapstic comedy with focus - now isn't that a relief. In fact, there is a point in the latter half where I'm wondering how is Shastri (Rajat Kapoor) going to get out of this? I love it when the writer or director makes me think on his behalf. He has me hooked, irrespective of whether or not I'm enjoying his film. Of course, a film like this wouldn't achieve half of what it aims to if the actors aren't capable of getting their timing right. Here, Sanjay Mishra, and the actor who plays Anni (Manu Rishi?) are just brilliant. Who would've thought that a movie would stand tall on their shoulders? That too, with Rajat Kapoor and Neha Dhupia around, in terms of ""star-value"". Both of them have forced dialogue delivery and Neha Dhupia's character is too stylized. Also, the feminism her character portrays is tasteless. Yet, a person who enjoys slapstick is certainly going to enjoy Phas Gaye Re Obama much more than I did. So, a light, Sunday afternoon watch it is.]"
685,"[A chapter in history that begins with the geography of the country. The classroom effect is hard to shake off and is made only more difficult with Abhishek Bachchan digressing from a Math lesson straight into a mini-lecture on revolution. After this lame sequence, I didn't know whether I'd laugh or cry for the next 2.5 hours; all while the cast/crew wanted to inspire. The audience around me was laughing. And that grew louder with Deepika Padukone's entry. The lady just breaks into a song! BUT, things settle down. It's not that the unintentional laughter dies, but slowly, very slowly you are hooked. And it goes into 5th gear post-interval. The execution of the plan is engaging, despite the complete lack of depth in characters.There are some 60 odd revolutionaries, about 7-8 main ones. But none of them have any distinguishing character. They are all willing to give their lives for the cause, they all care for each other with heart and soul, they all want to make whatever little contribution they can. Maybe in that time and age the mob identity was their personal identity. And yet, the reactions by different people to the same situation is both eye-opening and touching. You will have to wait for the second half to see this though. Director, Ashutosh Gowariker's plan to keep the set-up of the grand plan in the first half, and focus on execution and aftermath in the second half is a huge dampener to the pace. The portrayal of the aftermath is the most interesting and well-executed part of the film and the end credit roll is as good as it could get. Another decision that either the director or the writer made is to assume that the viewer knows the history and the backdrop of the Chittagong conspiracy. This decision is what kept me from getting involved. Also, the narrative is like a father is telling a story to his son, ""this happened, then that happened, then this happened"". A flow is missing. A little background, a little rhythm to get the viewer into the atmosphere that the characters were living in would have made me care for the characters much sooner. And despite that, I was on board by the end. And that I think is what a good basic plot can do. As you realize by the end, there is no great dialogue, no room for brilliant performances, and yet you are with the characters. The pathos created in the last third of the film has gone a long way in doing that. So many characters and each is given its own room in the true story and thus in the film. So much so that, in this star-driven world of Hindi cinema, you don't see either Abhishek Bachchan or Deepika PAdukone get in the way of their characters (until the end, where I guess they had to justify Abhishek's fee). And they all do just fine.  They were crazy. Anyone who leaves the comfort of their home and fights for a cause that is not necessarily theirs has to be crazy. They fought for our freedom. Who is to say that the struggle, which lasted a few centuries, wouldn't have gone on for 80 more years? Who's to say we wouldn't have to stay out of the McDonalds and the multiplexes along with their dogs? We don't know why they were so passionate about our freedom, but they were. The least we can do is be aware of their story. So what if it's not told in the most engrossing manner. Not screwing up our freedom that they were eccentric about is too much to ask for, right? ]"
686,"[I gifted the DVD of Head On to my brother on his wedding anniversary, only to discover that he returned it to me a week later, stating that his wife didn't regard it as a 'wedding anniversary' gift. This surprised me. I'd enjoyed watching Head On. However, now that bro had returned it, I watched it again, wearing the 'wedding anniversary' lens. And I realised that bhabhi is right.It didn't mean that Head On is not a good film - it's just that despite being a story about a married couple's relationship, it is a setting that many would find too intense and uncomfortable. In fact, without the destruction and violence they bring upon themselves, the passions that run between Cahit and Sibel and their love for each other, commands envy. Set in Turkey, Head On is about Cahit, a 40-yr old hot-tempered divorcee, who attempts suicide only to land up at rehab where he meets Sibel, who proposes him to marry her immediately. Not that she wants to be married, but her parents want a Turkish groom. This promise to be just 'room-mates' after marriage, is what marks the beginning of a life, that spins wildly out of their control, where their independent identities overlap their sense of being married. Akin's treatment of the film is like that of a ballad. An orchestra, beautifully perched on the banks of the Bosphorus river in Istanbul starts the film and makes appearances at key moments, deepening our understanding of the story. This helps us see Cahit and Sibel as characters in a tale, rather than those with whom we look to identify with. At times, you feel sorry for the couple, thinking that if only they tried, they could make things so much better. At times, you cheer for them, as they discover sparks in what is simply a marriage of convenience. Cahit is an addict, with a bad temper and is sometimes in bed with other women. Sibel, on the  other hand is a dream room-mate to have, cooks really well, cleans the room, insists on hitting the dance floor often, but doesn't mind hooking up for the night with the first good looking man she finds. These traits not only draw Cahit and Sibel closer to each other, but also disrupt their lives permanently. The film's music is one of its biggest strengths. Akin uses it well (reminds you of Dev D). Both Cahit and Dev drink like a fish, do drugs, show anger through violence and keep their rooms extremely dirty. The similarities end there. Akin, in an interview on the DVD, says that he was immensely inspired by people like Kurt Cobain and James Dean. Indeed, both of their self-destructive characters, are depicted in how he directs Cahit and Sibel. Both Birol Unnel (Cahit) and Sibel Kekilli (Sibel) give oustanding performances.Head On is disturbing and gory, because it makes no inhibition in showing violent love. But it is one film that you want to revisit, just to relive passions that you rarely see in relationships these days. Some may mistake Akin's story as that of love at first sight, when in fact, it is about impulsive choices and consequences that go beyond your control.]"
687,"[We all know Aslan, the White Witch and the Pevensie kids pretty well after the last two Narnia films. This movie brings only the two younger kids, Edmund and Lucy, and their intolerable cousin Eustace to Narnia to help Prince Caspian find the seven lords of Narnia on his ship, the Dawn Treader.A fluent flow of story and regular doses of excitement keeps you rooted to your seats through the run-time. Unlike the previous episodes, where they rushed to cover the plot points of the story, this movie brings out depth to the characters of the film. The music intensifies the terror and matches the unhurried plot development. A good thing is that you don't need to read the novels to understand this movie. Of course people who've read the series will argue differently because of a couple of changed sequences, but that is true of every classic fantasy novel adapted into a movie. I could see kids in the theatre tremendously enjoy themselves, and adults to seemed to genuinely like the world of magic and wonderment. The dialogues are awesome, but I bet they are right from the book. The actors playing the Pevensie kids haven't improved much over the previous films. But casting Will Poulter in the role of Eustace Srubb is one of the better decisions. He does a brilliant job of being a whiny, unbelieving and obnoxious cousin. His encounters with Reepcheep, the talking mouse, give many a laugh with excellent timing and dialogues. Ben Barnes plays a good Caspian portraying his buried doubts of ability.The action sequences are really good, especially considering that the target audience is school kids. Though the emotional scenes were a bit lengthy and boring, I am sure kids will love them. The special effects are superb too. The talking mouse Reepcheep, the invisible castle and Monocolis (one legged dwarfs) are awesomely made. Things like showing fog issuing from invisible and magical mirrors' mouths were great ideas to make the film believable yet magical. That Aslan looks old and less majestic, was a major disappointment for me because I love his character the most. Thankfully, his reverberating voice is as captivating as ever before. And they tried their best to make the scariest serpent and the most beautiful dragon. Though the climax feels like a mix of Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potter, it has its own charm. 3D sure helps, though they could have made it much scarier and more appealing. With a little more maturity in the story than the previous films shows, direction takes the cake for this film. Like any other book adopted into a film, this one has loopholes too. So if you have read the novels, you surely not going to like the way they twist the story to their convenience. But the visual treat compensates for it. In any case, this film is a good watch for kids as well as adults, - 3D or 2D. ]"
688,"[Story-tellers have often been fascinated with the depths a man plunges to under the influence of alcohol. If you can think deep about how addiction affects creativity, career, love, family, society and you've got fodder for a plot,  it's good enough to be woven into a screenplay. From India, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's  Devdas , was spun into various versions on screen. In the West, one of the earliest films made on this theme, is Billy Wilder'sThe Lost Weekend.Filmed in 1945, after Wilder chanced upon a novel by the same name on a railway journey to Hollywood, The Lost Weekend, a story about four days in the life of a chronic alcoholic, is possibly one of his best written films. I say so, because there have been few films that have articulated the effects of alcohol on the human mind, the desperation that follows, when one drink is too much and yet, even a hundred more are not enough. That's exactly the dilemma of the film's protagonist Don Birnam (Ray Milland, in an Oscar winning performance), a struggling writer who after being hailed as Hemingway as a 19-year old in college, is 33 now and cannot put pen to paper, because his mind is always asking him ""to have a drink first"".Wilder makes Birnam express his desperation, frustration and helplessness through memorable lines and while doing so, provides a great commentary about an alcoholic's obnoxious nature in society and his obsession with getting his next fix. The gravity of Birnam's situation is expressed through fantastic close-ups. In a scene where Birnam is settling down for a drink, he is shown removing his coat and sitting on the sofa - Wilder almost equates Birnam's relationship with alcohol as sexual in nature. There are also scenes where he uses characters to illustrate society's condemnation and lack of hope about the writing profession, something which adds to Birnam's woes and makes him drown his sorrows even more, in alcohol. What amazes is how little time the screenplay takes in establishing Birnam's condition. As the film progresses through a linear narrative, interspersed with flashbacks, Wilder guides the viewer scene by scene, to what depths Birnam has fallen, to get his liquor. He also uses satire with good effect - a rehab centre is named 'Hangover Plaza' and some regulars there are former advertising professionals! A special mention about the terrific background score - a classic trademark in all Billy Wilder films - which gives the film an eerie feel, unheard of, in a genre like this. Some scenes are frightening, especially the hospital scene towards the end, which has me squirming, every time I watch it. Wilder uses lights, doors, sounds and Birnam's close-ups to great effect. In my view, the biggest reason why the story of The Lost Weekend is a classic, is that 65 years later, mankind is still battling with addiction, rehab centres haven't changed their treatment measures and the expression on the face of a man desperate for his next glass of liquor, is still the same. Bravo, Mr Wilder.]"
689,"[Before I saw this movie, a fellow reviewer at wogma and a friend, said to me - ""This looks like 'The Burning Train' all over again."" I had similar notions about the film and was not too excited about watching it. The promos gave away all the story there is - an unmanned train carrying  highly toxic inflammable chemicals for cargo is heading at a very high speed towards a densely populated area and someone has to stop it before it causes mass destruction. But as you watch the movie, whenever you begin to think it's all predictable and boring, the movie throws in some masterfully shot action sequences, or some complications that lead to change of plans. The movie excels in both these departments and the action sequences are good enough to give you a rush. The complications make you think of ways to overcome them. Most people in the theatre, were talking to each other while watching the movie, and for once, it didn't annoy me. For on more than one occasions, I did the same with my friends. We discussed strategies, ""Why don't they do this instead?"" or ""They should try that!"" I believe a movie has done its job well, when it gets the audience so engaged. More so, when in the movie, they eventually discuss and try out half the ideas that we were floating around in the theatre. It made the story believable (it is inspired by a true story after all) and made us feel involved. Admittedly, there are some loopholes and heroics that are not seen in real life. But hey, whats an action movie, without some heroics, right? The ending might not satisfy everyone and may make you feel a bit cheated. There has been a lot of chatter in discussion forums over the net, about the choice of actions they took in the movie, and how they could have been more effective. But if you keep an open mind that all actions to prevent a disaster have to be taken with the approval of bureaucratic people who try to play safe in such situations and the time crunch does not always bring out the best in people, you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie. Denzel Washington is good as ever in the role of veteran engineer who is close to retirement. Chris Pine does well in his role of a newly assigned conductor who is working out his family issues. How tragedy makes them friends, is again no rocket science, but executed well. The direction is flawless and is the life and soul of the movie. The train sequences have been shot so masterfully that it gives you plenty of edge-of-the-seat, breathtaking moments. The screenplay gets a bit off the course at times, but since they had little story to play around with; you don't feel it sticking out as a sore thumb. Dialogues are cliched, straight from the old-school action films, but the action more than makes up for it. The background score is fantastic and gives a lot of depth to the action sequences. After the first fifteen minutes or so, the movie never hits a low. It's a thrill ride, with no unnecessary stunts or over-the-top action sequences, which makes it one of the best thriller movies in recent times. The lighter moments which make fun of bureaucracy are fun to watch too. Watch this for sure, preferably in theatre.]"
690,"[Break Ke Baad the is title inviting. For reviewers to poke fun at. But we shall refrain. Make that try to refrain. Neither before interval not after is there a high point in the film. The conflict comes in the promos and stays there until the zzzzz climax. Like Abhay (Imran Khan) and Aaliya's (Deepika Padukone) on and off relationship, moments come and go. But nothing lingers, except for a looming sense of boredom.With focus on just two characters, you'd hope, the film would take us to a level that we know exactly how they are going to behave. The problem though is that we know our writers much better. We know, they like Abhay, will never take risks. Actually, half-way through the film, you know there's only disappointment written for you in the end. If everyone lives happily ever after, you are going to yawn. If they choose otherwise, you are going to be ridiculing the pointlessness of the film. The writers brought a no-win situation upon themselves. Way too many times a beautiful thought is ruthlessly murdered by making it verbose. A film that aims at relating to the youngsters has to have something more interesting than their own fights, no? You understand the pain but don't get what the big deal is! A girl and a boy love each other. And like all girls and boys who are in love, they bicker until they get on our nerves. One is clingy, the other wants space. They are used to each other, so they ricochet between staying together and apart. Every once in a while they say something remarkably insightful about each other. Like two people who actually know each other. Our life on screen. In fact, they add a zest, they don't take their fights too seriously. Good.Only all this happens in the first half hour and repeats some 3-4 times till the end. Yet, you don't sense the claustrophobia both of them are going through. And ultimately, the characters behave like characters in a film and not like normal human beings. From being cool with their differences and conflict, suddenly these kids go on a break and are back or not or not. Bad. Very bad.When a film chooses to mimic life and its relationships, you expect a certain warmth, which is completely missing. It's not that the actors are not doing a good job. Deepika Padukone's straight back has always made her not-so-human for me. But, the director chooses a lot of close-up shots for her and she uses them well too. The irritation, the confusion, the straightforwardness comes through.  Imran Khan wears a lot of make-up. He looks like a school boy. His character is a little on the feminine side. That's cool and he passes off as the guy who who's love struck too. But it's all very ordinary. They still don't make the characters believable.Also, I'd much rather not see Sharmila Tagore and Navin Nischol, than see them in such shoddily written characters with some of the silliest lines. There are a couple of side characters who were interesting, but the writers didn't have time from converting dialogues into long, mundane monologues, to delve into them. I appreciate the subtlety in Nadia's (Shahana Goswami) relationship with both Abhay and Aaliya but it looked like the editing took a whole lot of her out of the film.Equally wasted is some awesome music. The songs come and go in the background without registering much visually. Only saving grace is that the picturisation don't kill the songs either, even if they don't add to them. I'm still going to buy the album. Actually, the title Break Ke Baad is a sham. Because no one has ventured into what a person goes through when he/she has broken up. Whether they have broken up or the other person has, it's still hurtful and that pain comes across only once or twice in the film. And, even then, it doesn't cut through you. Baah! What a romanticized world I live in. I'm expecting romantic films to touch me. ]"
691,"[The ""revenge is futile"" concept is as new as the next ""boy meets girl"" plot. Moreso, when it's set in a Mumbai slum. But that in combination with the ""ganglord wants to mend his ways"" has enough meat to make a film if it is treated with finesse. Allah Ke Bande starts on its way there, but gets lost in trying to stylize and dramatize. A couple of very interesting plot points lose out because the writer/director don't know where to focus.The writing also suffers from the usual pace issues. One half slow, other half desperately trying to catch up. I understand the set-up is necessary for us to feel for the characters, but here it didn't matter. The second half could very well have been a different film. None of the characters introduced in the first half have anything to do post-interval (yeah-yeah, except the protagonists!) Sharman Joshi is the cool, calculative planner, Vijay and Faruk Kabir is the impulsive executor, Yakub. Though there were times when Yakub doesn't follow plans and Vijay does most of the execution. But there's no serious, unfathomable deviation from initial set-up. Sharman does a very good mix of tense, disappointed, rebellious, romantic. Faruk on the other hand is very repulsive. This is intentional in all likelihood, but it gets overbearing and boring to see him on screen. Oh yeah, and the boys who play young Vijay and Yakub didn't work for me one bit. Their fuming seems superficial and their wigs serve as an unpleasant distraction. And despite the two doing exactly what is need of their characters, they fail to engage you. How is it possible when you are not privy to their plans? If I just see the execution, all I end up saying is ""a shootout is a shootout is a shootout"" and ""a chase is a chase is a chase."" What's the point if I don't care whether or not the chaser is caught and who is being killed in a shootout? There are soft moments and a couple of thought-provoking dilemmas. Mostly evoked by Atul Kulkarni's character, masterji (the school teacher). That's the situation, not the performance. This role is nothing close to what our man is capable of. The other moments are allowed by Anjana Sukhani's character, Sandhya. Sure, this is just another case of the woman being used as a prop, but Sandhya had shades of Parveen Babi's Anita in Deewar. There are many more smaller characters, but none that stick with you except for Naseeruddin Shah's performance as a warden. He has an impact on your nerves when he's on screen but after having seen the whole film, that role just looks like it was there for that one brutal scene in the jail. Allah Ke Bande's attempt at showing the inhuman conditions prevalent in such ""homes"". It tries to show how much harm these homes do instead of teaching the children a better way of living. It doesn't want to take a risk and keeps itself from getting too dark.A movie about crime usually has very little new to say. Allah Ke Bande tries real hard. You can't say it succeeded, if after seeing all the difficulties the protagonists go through, you feel, they get it all too easy. Are too many movies on the subject desensitizing us?]"
692,"[There is a sequence in The Sea Inside, where Ramon Sampedro (Javier Bardem), a quadriplegic for 30 years, is driven to court. Ramon has been fighting to legalize death by euthanasia, beginning with his own, much against his family's wishes.  During that drive, he sees some everyday, routine sights from the window of his vehicle - a mother beating up her child, a man cycling his way up along the countryside, and so on  Beautifully shot, the sequence is a fantastic recollection of his life's journey, his victories, his liberties, his failures and unfulfilled desires. It's one of the most memorable visuals  The Sea Inside.The Sea Inside's settings are believable, and the relationships between the characters are richly layered, thanks to an ably chosen supporting cast who form Ramon's support system. The depth of their relationships, even as they go about doing their regular chores is depicted with much maturity. New characters appear - another quadriplegic, for example, who disturbs the family equilibrium temporarily - but it only re-affirms their love and faith towards Ramon, despite him being a burden on them. There's love and of different kinds. The relationship of Sampedro with Julia (Belen Rueda), a lawyer with a heart disease, fighting for Sampedro's cause, is a stark contrast to that of Rosa (Lola Duenas), a lonely single mother, who on seeing Sampedro's interview on television, is drawn towards him, and tries to convince him to continue living. The drama between the characters is never overstated (Rosa's unwillingness to see Julia with Sampedro, for example). Despite Sampedro's condition, his personality and the sexual undercurrents in Julia's company are handled extremely well. (A scene where Julia is helping Sampedro smoke a cigarrette, is stunningly shot). A dinner scene between the family members and a quiet Ramon lying on bed upstairs, show his isolation from the rest of the world, in strong contrasting visuals. There are few directors who can ably hold a film so well in various departments -  Amenabar is not only the director, but also the writer, editor and music composer for the film. The film is often lyrical, almost poetic in the manner in which Ramon's thoughts blur all lines between reality and fantasy. Despite his immobility, he is able to move the lives of several others. Despite him having loved and lost, he wants to be loved again and his true lover is someone, who would help his cause i.e. relieve him of his condition. One of the common traits of great cinema is that by the time the credits roll, you feel richer - in emotion, in thought, in quotable lines. This film has plenty of them. At its core, the film makes the viewer attempt one simple question, ""If you love someone deeply, would you help him/her die when in pain?"" Interestingly, the film's subject of euthanasia is similar to Million Dollar Baby, which won the Best Picture in the same year as The Sea Inside. I've seen both, but I enjoy some sort of magic in a film's story-telling, something which transports the viewer much beyond the confines of his seat. In my view, Amenabar succeeds in doing that much better than Clint Eastwood. I'm also sucker for drama and tragedy, and I hunt down DVDs of tear-jerkers with the passion of a Nazi hunting a Jew. Overall,  The Sea Inside is cinematographic achievement from Spain, a country earlier known best for Pedro Almodovar (Broken Embraces, All About My Mother, Volver), but now, thanks to Amenabar, is exporting a new accomplished product. Beautiful.]"
693,"[Those of you who have seen horse racing in real life, and of course have heard about this much famed horse called Secretariat, will love this movie. Those of you who haven't, this one shows the life of Secretariat and what happens on and behind the scenes at horse races.Based on a true story, the movie is about Penny Chenery/Tweedy (Diane Lane) who, in her unwillingness to just sell off her father's farm, ends up owning and breeding one of the greatest racehorses. A semi-retired trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) who took up the responsibility, does probably the best job that one could. And its groom Eddie Sweat (Nelson Ellis) who knew the thoroughbred for the longest time, handles him with the same dedication that he handled several other winning horses. The chestnut colt was one of the youngest horses to win races, and two of its records still stand today. At a slightly clumsy pace, the movie is not exciting at all the times. It is slow and un-happening in large parts which one might as well sleep through. But the other extremely well-done sequences compensate for the glitches. The dialogues are just at par, with only a few good lines here or there. Most of the conversations fail to to engage, where they could have been phenomenal inspirational lessons. But then that is what makes the film look real and unexaggerated in the end. I would have honestly loved to see better acting from Diane Lane, where she's more free and genuine. The forced dialogues and uncomfortable body language for a lead is a huge put off. Malkovich is apt in his little-crazy trainer role, which I am sure, comes from the real Lucien Laurin. The best is Nelson Ellis (Yes, Lafayette of True Blood), in his limited role gives precisely a father's reflection as he grooms the much famed horse. Margo Martindale does justice to the father's secretary, Miss Ham who has been around horses and races more than Tweedy and looks after the family. Appreciable was Otto Thorwarth who plays the horse's jockey, who is a real life jockey and now wants to pursue acting. I really enjoyed the second match seen on TV as the Tweedy family saw it. It was the recording of the actual race. Also the other races, which last for a short while but show real action. I also enjoyed the mute nuances, which said a lot more than any of its dialogues. The movie is good if you can deal with the slow parts. It has a great story but lack of pace and directional competence will make this one a martyr. If you are really keen, then watch on screen. ]"
694,"[RED stands for Retired and Extremely Dangerous. And Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich  &amp; Helen Mirren are so ""ED"". Though the movie is based on the three-issue comic series by the same name, it has a pop-ish take on it. Since the comic-series didn't have enough content to be translated into a full movie they introduced many new characters and made the movie more comical than the comic-series. The concept of the movie is that a high-up official tries to pull off a conspiracy by taking off the good guys. But the picked the wrong lot to mess with. (Come on, no one messes with Bruce Willis! Even a fifth grader knows that.) The story however takes the back side, as it's the lead actors that shine throughout the film and make the movie-watching experience worth the money.The movie is very stylish and the action scenes are beautifully shot. I've watched the scene in the promos, where Bruce Willis casually steps out of the moving car, countless number of times, and never got enough of it. The screenplay is average but the performances are very powerful. Bruce Willis owns the role of Frank Moses. One second he is believable as the gentle giant to Mary-Louise Parker, and the next second he is out there knocking bad guys by the dozen as a highly efficient black-ops agent. Very few actors can come close to Bruce Willis when it comes to pulling off an action film with tongue in cheek dialogues. I for one, am his 'die hard' fan (Pun full-on intended). Morgan Freeman is composed as ever in his somewhat short role. John Malkovich was the pick of the lot for me. He was brilliant in the role of an eccentric retired agent who suspects everyone and everything. And Helen Mirren. Oh, she still steals the spotlight every time she's on screen - gracious as ever. Mary-Louise Parker did over act her part as Frank Moses' love interest, who is clueless about all the chaos surrounding her life. But knowing her capabilities as an actress, I guess she just made the best of what she was told to do. She had her moments to shine too. Brian Cox has a very interesting role in the film, one with many shades. He too fits in the character effortlessly. Lastly, if you don't recall the name Karl Urban yet (the new Dr. Bones, in the Star Trek franchise), you'll surely be hearing a lot of him in the future. After all, he is going to play THE Judge Dredd in its remake, scheduled to release in 2012. He plays the antagonist and managed to stand his ground pretty well in front of the biggies. Watch out for him. It's all good in the acting department, so the fault totally lies in the screenplay that fails to keep you excited. The lack of seriousness works for the characters but fails the story. It won't leave you in awe, but you'll enjoy watching it. After The Expendables and RED, looks like, too many cooks may not be that bad a thing. With these guys gone, it'll be end of an era for action movies. They dictate how action is supposed to be done. Watch it for the cast, as we don't know how long they'll hang around. But there's something to look forward to. Since a prequel to the comic-series has been announced, we just might have a prequel to the movie.]"
695,"[Q: What is the test of a good comedy film? A: One, it should make you laugh while it's on.     Two, it should continue to remind you of the laughter and gags, hours after you've seen it.     Three, it should make you want to watch it again and again.Date Night does well on all three counts. Starring the very likable pair of Steve Carell and Tina Fey - both have gained a reputation in all things comedy - and directed by Shawn Levy (Just Married, Big Fat Liar, Night at the Museum).There's also hilarious special appearance by Mark Wahlberg (topless in the film, throughout). The scene when the Fosters land up at his apartment seeking help, continues to make me laugh. I can't help smiling when I remember the way Carrell, Fey and Wahlberg perform that scene. I'm going to take a pause here, to finish laughing. I dare say that Date Night got me laughing a lot more than The Hangover did. I'm quoting Hangover specifically because for many, that films ranks as one of the best comedies from Hollywood. In Date Night, the humour works a lot more because of the fabulous comic timing between the actors - Carrell and Fey are both exceptionally gifted, not just as actors but incredible voice artists (Don't miss 'the gag reel' on the DVD). They also enact the bored suburban couple look perfectly in the first few minutes of the film, which is what makes us love them a lot more. The scene where they discuss the status of their married life something that might get married couples look at each other and smile. In fact, couples - both married and unmarried - will especially identify with the Fosters. I loved those scenes where they're at a restaurant and play a guessing game of what stage of relationship couples on other tables may be passing through. The gags and action sort of drag towards the end, and the pole dancing scene was a little extreme, in my view. Since you're watching it on DVD, and I suspect your family members are going to be around, it might make you cringe in your seat. But everything happens for a reason, as do those scenes. Just an indication that despite being in the 'screwball comedy' genre, Date Night manages to be a story about a couple rather than a mere comedy of errors. Try this film on a girl's night out or even on a stag night. Good fun! Don't miss the bloopers and special features on the DVD. There's a video which profiles one entire schedule in the making of the film, where you learn that the cast and crew are habituated to sleep during the day, since all the shoots happen at night. Director Shawn Levy confidently takes you through each step and the amount of detailing and precision that goes behind setting up each scene, is mind-boggling. Ultimately, you realise that in films that are not verbose, acting is such a small part of the entire film-making process.]"
696,"[With a title like How To Train Your Dragon, one can almost guess what the film has in store. Human meets animal. Friction and resistance. Human tames animal. They become friends and so on.Thankfully, the writers of this film have done a lot more to Cressida Cowell's novel by the same name, which is the original inspiration for this film. What's helped them is the faith, money and outstanding talent at Dreamworks, who've mounted this film on a scale that lends itself to not just spectacular 3D action, but also an immense feel good high, once it's over. I say this because the story, could have easily been done in live action, but wouldn't have been half as spectacular, nor convincing. The unfolding screenplay doesn't take too long to establish the storyline and the writers do just about enough to maintain the excitement throughout the film's duration. Starting with the action packed opening sequence filled with fireballs and slaughter of a host of dragons, there are spectacular flying sequences with Hiccup mounted on top of the Toothless (the dragon) and Astrid, his love interest. As a viewer, you know when you're watching them on screen flying in the clouds, how magnificent the film would have looked on the big screen, but since it's on DVD, I suggest the bigger your screen, the better. HTTYD's real merit lies in being a wholesome entertainer, despite tracing a predictable storyline. About 30 minutes into the film, and you instantly know how the story is going to shape out - the simpleton of the village will emerge a hero by the end of this film. So here's why the film works. I've always believed that audiences have certain hotpoints in their senses that a film must touch upon, if it has to please. Goosebumps, feel good proceedings, elements that make you go ""WOW"" and ""Woohoo!"" - these are just some emotions and reactions to make a good, compelling film. Fortunately, HTTYD has all of that. And since it's on DVD, the bonus features, which include the making of the film and the director's commentary do more than enough to validate your liking for this film. Typically, your admiration for an animation film always increases once you've seen the efforts that went into its making. HTTYD is no exception. So, although Gerard Butler, the voice of Stoik, the village chief, doesn't get the meatiest role in the film, it is fun watching him behind the microphone. Ditto for the supporting cast, producers and team of animators, who bring their own stories. For example, you'll learn that one of the most breathtaking shots in the film (when the frame does a complete U-turn in the sky), was cinematographer Gil Zimmerman's idea. John Powell's music has an enormous uplifting feel to it, so crucial for feel good, coming of age stories. And it was rather astonishing to learn that the animators actually went to a flying school to master the techniques of how birds and dragons would have taken flight. What's more, the creative team also ensured that since it's about dragons, there must be all kinds of them. And since they breathe fire, there is also a variety in the kinds of fire they spew. Possibly, that's just one of the reasons why it's a great idea to own it on DVD. Because you learn to appreciate the enormity of effort that actually went behind making every little scene, every sequence. HTTYD is one of the top contender's at the Oscars and Golden Globes next year. I think it stands a fair chance, considering it's a breath of fresh air, outside of the typical animation film cliches that we've come to know of - world of ants, monsters, fish, robots. Although, it doesn't make any powerful statement like Wall-E did, or evoke similar emotions to last year's winner Up, I think it still does enough to stand tall and be proud of itself in a highly competitive category. I'm sure that on your DVD shelf, it will behave similarly.]"
697,"[First things first. Yes, I've read all the books of Harry Potter. Fourth book onwards, all of them the first day. Does it make me a Harry Potter fan. Yes (Well, I prefer to call myself a J.K. Rowling fan). But does that make me a fan of the movies based on the uber-popular books too? Sadly, no. I didn't like most of the movie interpretations of the books. But after watching the pathetic interpretations of the Percy Jackson and The Golden Compass, I think these folks are doing a fine job with Harry Potter. Still, I went to watch this one with lowered expectations. And I was wonderfully surprised. As soon as the censor certificate showed up with the movie title on it, everyone in the theater was hooting, clapping and the kids were making all sorts of happy noises. So that set the mood. And the movie carried it forward from then on. About the movie: Harry, Ron and Hermione set out to find and destroy the rest of the horcruxes to defeat Lord Voldemort. On their journey they discover the existence of the three deathly hallows, which are the three most powerful magical objects of the wizarding world. They also uncover, that You-Know-Who is hunting one of them to become invincible. The movie doesn't show much action, but lays ground for much. Each character prepares for the inevitable war, that is to come in the last movie, which fingers-crossed, would be most awesome. The lead actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and ever-so-lovely Emma Watson) have done their job well.The supporting cast didn't have much role in this one but everyone shined brilliantly in the screen-time they had. I personally am a huge-huge fan of Helena Bonham Carter (who plays Bellatrix Lestrange in the movie) and would have loved to see more of her. But hey, the story is already written and they can't play around with it much. However, they did try to fit in a few lighter moments in the film that were not in the book, and have pulled off most of them. A couple of times, the jokes seem forced though.Most of the movie is shot in shades of gray (So if you're not watching it on the big-screen you're not going to enjoy it much). While I heard a few people complain about the darkness of the movie (They meant the dark colors. Though Voldemo... whoops.... He-who-must-not-be-named oozes plenty of darkness too), I loved it. Like in the movies like The Dark Night, Inception, Kill Bill, etc the darker shades added to the eeriness of the movie and took it from a kids' film to a we-mean-serious-business one. The background score by Alaxandre Desplat is amazing. Cinematography is a visual treat. Screenplay and Direction are ten folds better than the two movies that preceded this one. And here is another surprise. The best thing about the movie for me was not Emma Watson (Not even her making out scene. Yes, there is one. You're already on your way to the theater aren't you?) Not that. It was the five minutes animated sequence that told the story of the origin of the three deathly hallows. Brilliant is an understatement for it. It's so brilliantly done that I didn't want it to end. Verdict: You know you're going to watch it. And you wouldn't enjoy watching it nearly as much on your TV screen. So you should go, watch, and enjoy this one on the big screen. But if you were hoping for lots of action, you'd be disappointed.]"
698,"[As I begin my trip on the wrong side of 35, I think a lot about old age. And every once in a while the thought is punctuated by the passing away of an ""aged"" person. People might not say it out loud, but that death comes as a relief - not only to the person who dies. Old age with ailments is not anything anyone looks forward to. ""Please don't let me live on like a vegetable,"" is something I hear from friends a lot more than I'd like, even though it's only a casual remark. But, what if, you don't have to wait for old age for this to happen. What if you are hit with this situation in your prime? That's what happens to Ethan (Hrithik Roshan) in Guzaarish. And Sanjay Leela Bhansali paints such a beautiful picture to bring across the pathos that you almost ignore how silly the basic plot is. The picture is beautiful not only because you can see the thought gone into composing each frame; but also because the writing has a lot of restraint. Ethan doesn't go into a spiel demanding our sympathy. He gains it because of the situations he's in. From the fly he can't shoo off to the anger he can't vent out physically, make you feel for his despair. Of course, they had to mess it up in the end but then again, that scene becomes tolerable because it hasn't been used earlier. Yes, it has all the emotional triggers, visually, in speech and in music. Well, it's supposed to be an emotional scene, after all. And Hrithik Roshan had to get the promised amount of screen time, right?But he, more or less, pulls it off. Often, his head dropped to one side like a mentally imbalanced person - while this got annoying, at other times he showed an unexpected degree of talent. Including the times he got angry. It's really not his fault that he went into the over-acting zone a la Amitabh-Bachchan-in-Black. When two distinct personalities act with the same mannerisms, the one man who directed both of them is at blame.Aishwarya Rai Bachchan stomps about the Goan mansion dutifully. She is breathtakingly beautiful. So perfect, that I can understand when I hear people say, ""she is so beautiful that it's difficult to like her."" That doesn't make the statement fair, but then again, it's unfair for someone to look divine too. (Sorry for this side, but throughout the film I was reminded of this comment on Guru's review where the commenter mentioned his servant looked better than Aishwary Rai, I guess Ethan can't even say that.)I admit, I didn't expect anything in the form of acting from anyone in this film. And I admit, I was mildly surprised. Let alone Ms. Rai Bachchan hell, even Nafisa Ali had a bit of voice modulation going around. I still have to get past Aditya Roy Kapoor's cute smile to decide if I really like his acting or not, but so far so good. He has a refreshing air about him. A bunch of other characters do their bit. And that's my grouse. Almost all of them come in the second half. I for one, get unsettled when characters and the base plot are set and then a new character is introduced, let alone 4-5 new ones. Sure, they were there for a purpose. But an ever-lasting introduction to characters, especially when the conflict comes in the first 10 minutes, threw the story structure off the chart. I love experimentation, especially with narrative styles, but this entry and exit of character after character looked like the writers were filling in blanks, ""Oye, we need a love interest. Hey, what about family? Hey, where did the enemy go? Oops, we forgot to give Sophia (Aishwarya) a backstory. And so on and on."" And all leading to what? Because of this need to clarify and justify, the meat goes missing. What a wonderful opportunity there was in a story where a person is appealing to the society to kill him, Secondly, the very purpose of Ethan's extra-ordinary character and fight is defeated when he decides to do what you and I would do. His fight seems futile and to an extent the film too.But, the point is that, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's intentions are clear from the first shot - one lyrical movement by Aishwarya even if it is something as mundane as drawing curtains. You know he's aiming for his brand of grandeur. (And he'll to stick that one grand set, even if the Indian Judiciary system has to shift address.) You know his purpose is to enchant with visuals. And that he does. He doesn't want anything close to real. Somewhere along the side he wants to say a story, but I guess, he must know too, that the plot is not his priority. So, he succeeds there too. It's just that it didn't work for me in entirety.Meanwhile, it does create empathy. Smokers out there might be able to identify with this one better - what if someone else decided the intervals at which you took your puffs while smoking one cigarette?]"
699,"[With over 500 million users, Facebook is by far, the largest socialnetworking site around. Facebook started in a Harward dorm room in2003 by Mark Zuckerberg who went on to become the youngest billionairein the world. The movie uses the lawsuits against Mark, to tell theback-story of how he came to achieve all that he did, pretty much likeSlumdog Millionare used the show 'Who wants to become a millionaire'to carry their story forward. And like Slumdog Millionare, here too,the formula worked like a charm. In pieces, it showed the changes inMark's character from the time he was a neglected undergrad to thetime he became a billionaire.I've grown up reading stories about Bill Gates and how many people heallegedly wronged on his path to success. Its Zuckerberg's time to beunder the torch. The movie would leave you with mixed emotions. You'dlove Mark for his genius and his passion towards Facebook. At the sametime you'd hate him for his cockiness and betrayals. So after themovie, be prepared to jump in to the intense debates of who wrongedwhom and how much of the movie is fact and how much is fiction. Itsgood fun, as from ex-Facebook CTOs, employees and founders all arehaving their say over the matter. Coming back to the movie, AaronSorkin did a great job with the script. It was driven with sharpdialogues that make this movie a fast paced entertainer, and not adocumentary. The surprise package for me was Justin Timberlake in therole of Sean Parker. I had little hopes from him, but he pulled off therole pretty nicely. Also, if you don't know the story behind SeanParker, do read it after watching the movie and you'd love hischaracter more.All in all, The Social Network, is a brilliant movie to watch, to enjoy,to get inspired and to have a healthy debate with friends.Release date for India couldn't have been timed better with all theheat between Google and Facebook. Also Facebook is rumored to launchits alleged Gmail-killer soon. And we thought Microsoft vs Apple wasthe epic battle. I won't be surprised to see a sequel a few years downthe line about either Facebooks downfall or about it, dominating theworld. Time shall tell. The only turn-off for me was all theprogrammers in the movie were made to talk really fast. They alwaysmake the geeks talk fast. Its like an unsaid code.We-don't-talk-that-fast. Wait. May-be-we-do. Dayum!]"
700,"[Note from meetu - Diwali on Fridays has been one of my worst dilemmas. wogma vs. family - a couple of the most high-profile films of the year versus the annual extended family get-together?  Invariably, I end up choosing family. Afterall, there are many Fridays but only one Diwali in a year. Handing it over to Poonam, who's reviewing Golmaal 3 for me. Thanks a ton! Means much! Wish you all a bright Diwali and a brighter year ahead!  * For someone like me, who has often asked this question - how do you keep your brains at home while watching a movie?, Golmaal 3 pretty much puts up a good defense in favour of brainless comedies.  Brainless because, predictably, there isn't a groundbreaking plot with any memorable twists, yet you enjoy the ride anyway.What works for Golmaal 3 is distinctiveness of all its characters and a fair share of spotlight on all of them. If not for this, the movie could have easily been one aimless chaotic drone, considering that it has a bevy of harebrained, crazy characters.Set in Goa, the movie is kept afloat with incessant squabbles of a gang of five aimless cons (Ajay, Shreyas and Arshad, Tusshar and Kunal) aided by a delightfully dishy chick (Kareena) and an earnest elderly couple (Mithun and Ratna Pathak Shah). Add a mad, forgetful goon (Jhonny Lever) with his two 'retro'grade henchman - therein lies an endless possibility of mindless wit and situational comedy.It is as if director Rohit Shetty did not want to repeat the mistakes of the previous one (yeah, I know that last year's Diwali release Golmaal 2 was also a hit, but..) - there are no crutch characters. Even Kareena's character is seamlessly woven into the narrative and has equal share as the boys.Yet what the movie loses in plot, it makes up in abundance with its wealth of jokes, funny one-liners, spoofs and situational comedies. The movie is one long standup comedy show where, more than the story, you wait for punches that are to be delivered. (I laughed at even the most cliche ones.) Rohit Shetty has also interspersed the movie with several Bollywood references. There is a spoof of rich girl, poor boy love story, atypical of Bollywood in 70s. Prem Chopra plays a cameo reminiscent of old times, and Mithun da receives a tribute of sorts by living his 'Disco Dancer' again. Then, there is Hum Saath Saath Hain playing in the family drawing room and Ghajni that lends a creditable gimmick to the plot.Jokes on fellow actors find place too, predictably Emran Hashmi features. Shahid is called Kameena (y), which could be interpreted in more than one ways, and then there is a dig even at Kareena's 'zero figure'.Music is fun and high-intensity, even if not very noteworthy (not surprising, since mood is mirthful). Two tracks, Disco Dancer and Yaad Aa Raha Hai, are from Mithun da's old movie, Disco Dancer. See, what I mean by tribute to Mithun Da. Movie is also replete with characteristic Rohit Shetty-esque quirks - action scenes with cars being smashed, the chase, the Golmaal vehicle - a 5-seater motorbike this time, and elaborate opening sequences.The fast-paced screenplay with its heavy slapstick couldn't have been executed without the chemistry, camaraderie and comic timing of the cast.  And when you have so many lead characters, it is only fair to credit each actor for making their quirks stand out. Though it was Ajay Devgan who not only got a grungy makeover, but also had an edge with all the masterstrokes bestowed to his character. The only two talented actors that I felt bad about were Mukesh Tiwari and Ashwini Kalsekar, who had little to do and were much ignored in this one. I also want to send a shout-out to the costume/dress designers that made their unobtrusive contribution to humor (not to mention the bright look and feel)- those typical costumes from 70s that Mithun and Ratna wear, note Jhonny Lever's pants (Rajesh Khanna? :P) and those of his dapper henchmen. Also, I am intrigued how most actors in comedies can easily carry off violet, firozi (sky blue) and pink shirts as well as colourful pants.That said, movie is not without flaws, the end doesn't come with a big bang. Instead, the climax takes its droll course in a maddening chaos with all the characters present on screen. Also, movie could have done with some editing scissors to blot out few repetitions. In addition, sometimes during a sequence, for example the one with Mithun and th dog, the audience patiently waited for a chaotic caper to subside, awaiting a new joke. Melodrama of 70s story playing out between Mithun and Ratna outside the church was another sequence that felt bit stretched.Yet, bottom-line is you will laugh. Even the cynic will watch it with a wide smile, minus too many cringes. Here's to a hilarious Diwali. ]"
701,"[Note from meetu - Diwali on Fridays has been one of my worst dilemmas. wogma vs. family - a couple of the most high-profile films of the year versus the annual extended family get-together?  Invariably, I end up choosing family. After all, there are many Fridays but only one Diwali in a year.Handing it over to Ideasmith, who's reviewing Action Replayy for me. Thanks a ton! Means much! Wish you all a crackling Diwali and a brighter year ahead!If you are a fan of 70s pop culture, if 'retro' sounds like home to you, then please don't watch Action Replayy - you might be tempted to destroy some furniture. If you are a sci-fi buff and still hold out for some promise in Bollywood, I suggest you look elsewhere. But if bright colours, loud noises and easy gags entertain you, Action Replayy just might work for you. Just don't expect another Om Shanti Om. In some ways, Action Replayy is a fitting Diwali release, considering that the volume is turned up all through the movie. Think blinding pyschedelia in Eastman colour and crescendo-style background scores for the frequent melodrama scenes. The movie starts on the run, with everything speeded up, which you figure might be so that the story can get to the main meaty blast from the past. Once there, the plot loses its pace and runs on spoofy moments vaguely reminiscent of 70s cinema, like exaggerated caricatures and extreme proclamations (""No love marriage!""). The trouble with this spoof is its lack of authenticity. Considering that the subject is an age of rich iconography and abundant pop culture references, Action Replayy is woefully tacky in its depiction. Coverage is very superficial, sticking only to crazy hairstyles and an explosion of polka-dots in every scene. For the first half of the movie, the sheer novelty of time travel, the cinematic flourishes of switching to Eastman colour, the vibrancy of retro-style Bombay keep you engaged. The scene where Bunty (Aditya) first looks around and gets his bearings in 70s' Bombay carries through predictably but nicely. After the interval, the mixed up references, the lack of a coherent plot and the jerky pace start to grate a bit. There is some saving grace in the chase sequence at the end, true to 70s cinema complete with action, comedy and romance.Akshay Kumar hams it up as Kishen 'Kitchen' Kumar, the loser-turned-stud and it fits well enough in a movie of this type. Aishwarya Rai's character seems to have gone astray since she starts off as shrewish, morphs into impish, detours into bully tomboy and finally dissolves into maudlin. Om Puri and Kiron Kher look like their having a real blast in their extreme but funny roles. A talented actor like Rajpal Yadav is sadly wasted in the sort of role usually reserved for the Johnny Levers and Jaspal Bhattis of current day Bollywood. Randhir Kapoor and Neha Dhupia each make blink-and-you-miss-it appearances. The real surprise in this movie is newcomer Aditya Roy Kapur who navigates the jerky plot with ease, holding his own superbly against the more senior actors (everybody else). Rannvijay Singh may have presence or he may not but its really hard to tell when he's hidden behind the scary facial hair, styling and acting (possibly a throwback to the chest-rubbing aura of yesteryear Ranjit). The incomplete visual references aside, the music disappoints too, not because it is bad in itself but because music is a key aspect of Bollywood film-making and would be expected to deliver on the past versus present front. Most of it doesn't fit the style of the era, in terms of melody, lyrics, instrumentation or even choreography. At times, it even even blunders into 80s-style bling or 60s-age nasal voices. Other than the credits theme in the very beginning, none of the other songs fit their situations, at all.If I sound disappointed, it's only because I know that so much more could have been done even within the limited dimensions of this movie. Even going with a gag-ridden, cardboard-character spoof, the budgets might have been better used if the research had been a little deeper or the story better thought out. Instead, they seemed to have gone for flashy promos and trailers that cull most of the high points of the movie. Everything else is just bright colours and loud noises. Still, it is Diwali after all, so I suppose there is some timepass to be derived from those.]"
702,"[This review is a tribute to all my friends who complain that reviews here don't tell them about the story.Once upon a time, there lived a little boy called Bukka. The trauma of having a weird name was the first scar on his mind. It was only symbolic of what would seem like a troubled childhood. The other damage to his brain was caused by the creepy voiceover narrator who told him bedtime stories. Bukka made his nightmares real for others, in their actual life. When boys and girls his age were learning to color within the lines, he looked for creative ways of spurting blood out of big, fat black ants. It wouldn't be a surprise if we found out that his father actually designed new instruments for him to hone his skill. These toys were why he loved his father. The only person he ever loved. (yeah, yeah, you are at the right place. This is the review of Rakht Charitra I)As he grew older, he graduated to frogs, rats, and eventually humans. Such was Bukka's love for killing in new ways that, when one of his men was found dead, he would get disgusted with how cliched the murdering style was, and kill one or two of his own henchmen, because they happened to be around. He never needed a reason to kill. His father, Nagmani Reddy, usually had someone handy to serve as specimen. Nagmani was a politician. Nagmani was an insecure, second-wrung politician. Nagmani was led by an easily-influenced, pawn politician, another Reddy. Other Reddy politician had a trusted rightman Veerbhadra. Now at this point (which is 7-10 minutes into the film), if I think hard, I'm sure I'll remember who offended whom and then killed whom. And there was always someone or the other who wanted revenge. But, I'm not too inclined to stress my memory. Because I don't think Ram Gopal Varma/Prashant Pandey care much about that. Their only intention is to set a clear stage for the next Rakht Charitra threatening to knock our doors in exactly 4 weeks. But he still had these 2 hours to fill before he could get there. So, he has put up an exhibition of the goriest gore possible. And shed all pretentions of giving us reason. Unfortunately, so impressed was he with his own output that he just added the last 15 minutes to make whatever happened thus far, redundant. While I have begun enjoying gore to a certain extent (so what if I still squirm), I'm a happy child if there's meaning and story behind it. And this is what happened in the last 15-30 minutes. The story presents such an interesting 'what if' for the sequel that I had to bump the rating up by a bit. Though the glimpses felt like it will just have more of the same. Else, Rakht Charitra is to pulp action, what David Dhawana/Priyadarshan comedies are to slapstick - brainless, story-less, motivation-less. *Ps. In this world of gore, don't assume there is no place for women. Albeit the only two functions they have are to serve as objects to satisfy lust or to cry and feed for their men. Pps. I have a question. If Aakrosh can get into trouble for derogatory remarks against CBI officials , how come no one is bothered about the practical absence of law enforcement agencies in Rakht Charitra?Ppps. Oh yeah, the actors they all growl and widen nostrils very well! The background music growled and the camera looked like it had nostrils that wanted to widen them beyond their capacity. O-kay enough nonsense!]"
703,"[A friend is a friend is a friend. He has moral support, come what may. To that extent, Jhootha Hi Sahi is true-to-life and very enjoyable. Like any other group of friends, each one in this bunch has below-the-belt insults in store for each other and yet they'll watch out for each other in the most ridiculous situations. This initial set-up is hilarious and mucho fun. But, set that aside and almost everything is superficial, improbable, and many-a-time outright stupid. Even if you ignore everything else that's wrong with Jhootha Hi Sahi, the songs (every, single thing about them) and the climax , unfortunately are turn-offs HUGE enough to make you dislike the whole film. The crisp dialogue, its delivery, the slapstick and its timing is simply brilliant as the film starts. Yes, I laughed out loud at the most typical slapstick. And I have only the director to thank for that because brilliant actors have brought an eye roll with predictable slapstick. Of course, the actors did their bit here too. Else, who would've thought John Abraham would make me laugh with him?  But that happens only when he is not preaching philosophy or flitting like a butterfly (I shall NOT elaborate). Anyhow, every once in a while, he and a few of the others have ""quote of the day"" type lines which deserve and got a cringe and a few more. The others actors did well only because of the banter-type lines that go between friends. But, Anaitha Nair and Alishka Varde fit in perfectly as the kind of girl-friends I'd like to have, spirited and always bring a smile! Pakhi on the other hand, doesn't necessarily ooze charm. But it's just refreshing to have a non-glam, non-wannabe-size-zero as the female lead. She has to play a character she has written, Mishka. While I don't know whether that made it easy or difficult for her, I appreciated that Mishka grew as a woman and wasn't defined only by the men in her life. Also thematically, it was a delight to see an inclusive attitude towards the homosexual community. Not only were there non-trivial gay characters, Mishka is also shown going ""aaawwww"" for a fleeting moment in a song when she sees a lesbian couple. Heartening beyond measure. Besides that and other close-to-life, normal characters, the script ranged from random sub-plots to uninhibitedly absurd. There are characters and they have stories, but their motivations are unknown and their actions unjustified. There's the girlfriend who doesn't seem to care but is supposedly in love and there's the friend who doesn't want to marry the guy she's in love with. When nothing comes of these sub-plots, they look like mere props in the grander scheme of things. In fact, that is partly true of the main character, Siddharth, as well. The film makes you wonder whether he or his friend, Omar know when (let alone why) he falls in or out of love? Then again, maybe that's cool too, because that is a mere reflection of the confused 'gen x'?]"
704,"[The foreplay between the religious, political, and administrative systems is sickening in some parts of the country. Nothing new. But every once in a while, a film comes that reminds you of that 7th page news item you dismissed with a nod of helplessness. Throughout Aakrosh you want to ask the question, ""how can these local goons/politicians/police get away with it?"" And every time the film reminds you of the horrifying nexus which barely shakes by something we commoners call ""HUGE"" scam.We see the world of the deteriorated legal system in Bihar through the eyes of the CBI investigators played by Ajay Devgn and Akshay Khanna. They are frustrated and left aghast by the situation, and so are we as an audience. This is when the issue of ""honor killing"" is barely talked about. In fact, it's assumed that the audience knows what the issue is. The reason for the atrocities are more or less left to our imagination. So people expecting ruthless bigotry won't see that. But ruthlessness, they'll see for sure. This ambiguous justification might as well be intentional. The issue could be anything, the vulnerability of the powerless, is after all, the same. Only words like helpless and defenseless come to mind because as you see the massacre you wonder, ""is fighting for the cause, however valid worth it?"" Sure, t cause might be worth fight for. But when fighting for it ends up killing hopes and the people the hope belongs to, who is the fight for? The fact that I can just spend three paragraphs just discussing the issue says that Priyadarshan has hit the nail. The direction is smart and razor-sharp. The joy of seeing a director, with so many awful films to his name, make such brilliant camera decisions is inexpressible. Because of his guidance, I witnessed some of the best performances from actors I've always admired. Amongst the many villains of society, the policeman that Paresh Rawal plays is the one you want to see beaten to a pulp. Such emotion for an actor I look forward to watching - you can judge the power of his act. We've seen Ajay Devgn in similar roles, but you only want more, even if it's the same from him. True, his antics as Spiderman and James Bond do make you laugh. Though because it's all done well, the occasional 'whoa' does make an escape from your mouth. If only such action fit into the genre of social awakening. The rest of the cast do their bit, albeit not necessarily as impressively. Any non-actor could easily have played Akshaye Khanna and Bipasha Basu and we wouldn't know the difference. Also their characters aren't too detailed. While Bipasha Basu's character might serve the purpose of giving some backstory to other characters, Akshaye Khanna's character's only purpose seems to be to echo our thoughts, the thoughts of the city-bred audience.  A person to whom an explanation can be given, so that the audience's question is also answered. The other flaw in the writing is that there is no flow between scenes. The events all look too disjointed. While these things are somewhat acceptable, the songs and more so their abrupt placement in the film are just unforgivable. Not only are they obviously gratuitous, they completely ruin the build of the situation. This is also true of a few scenes where the pauses last a few seconds or the camera lingers longer than necessary. They make an otherwise well-paced film seem sluggish. Yet, it is well worth the buck because Aakrosh has some of the most well-shot chase sequences - on foot, cycles and cars. Meanwhile, the issue raised is something that is not talked about too often. Even if people aren't killed too often, there are far too many couples who have to either part ways/live a very difficult life because they belong to different caste/region/religion. Nothing to be proud of, but needs to be documented. Hopefully the future generations will be able to take pride in the fact that they have evolved as human beings.]"
705,"[Hindi movies are repetitive and predictable. And yet they manage to surprise you. Knock out actually managed to get an awful performance out of Irrfan Khan. Yep! Disheartening, no? At first, I thought it was his ridiculous hairstyle I aren't being able to distract myself from. But, with the passing minutes it was difficult to let the haywire curls shoulder all the blame.While watching Irrfan Khan deteriorate, Sanjay Dutt's usual stylish, confident, goon act seemed like an award-winner. Kangna Ranaut? Oh, you mean her shrieks, weird dialogue delivery mechanism aka her pout? I just wanted her to go back to her drugged out, mentally ill characters. In fact, looks like she was missing those days too. She tried to pull one of those looks off, in a scene where she's supposed to be scared. After all of this there is only so much Sushant Singh's cool atitude can pull off? Also, one of the other main characters, the phone booth was way too lavish to portray the character's internal struggle or the claustrophobia he feels because of the person he is. Despite all of this, I'd say Knock Out is far better written than your average thriller. With any fiction, there still is a realm of reality within which the story should/or at least try to stay. The way around this, is ofcourse to spread the acceptability sphere so wide, that almost anything is possible from within. So, the whole world is at Sanjay Dutt's disposal. By definition, his act is so well planned, that you cannot question his capabilities of being ready for almost anything. When you cannot question the character's capacities, all you are left with is the bare bone plot. Knock out had a strong-ish hold on that one till they gave way to all of mother cliche's children. The spiels wouldn't stop and to ace it, you had one character actually say, ""I haven't called you to preach!"". Yeah, right! Yet, Knock out covers a lot of ground. It touches upon the cool aloofness of the CCD-generation towards bomb-blasts and such everyday happenings, till something completely out of the ordinary happens - like a suited-guy does a ridiculous dance in the middle of the road. It goes on to show how self-centered we are in our roles - whether we are news reporter or a police officer. We want to keep control, irrespective of the life-and-death situation at hand - as long as it is not ours. This becomes clearer when a direct question is posed ""my career vs. nation's future"" The character chooses the latter and you go 'baah!' Which is when I realized how truly self-absorbed we are when we cannot even accept our fictional characters giving up on personal aspirations. Yet, towards the end I was thinking. So, what if, what happens in this film actually comes true? What will we as a country do about it? How will we as citizens hold the new people in-charge accountable? Now, when a movie has made you think that one bit about the topic it's about, it has done something right, even if it is a teeny-weeny bit.]"
706,"[Diaspora films (at least those made in India) have a tendency to comment negatively about the local conditions which the protagonists live in. They complain about racism while doing the exact same thing. It makes me cringe - because neither do all locals behave that way, nor are all Indians so hopelessly bigoted; because some people on both sides are blatantly intolerant. So, the filmmakers either propagate a stereotype the world can live without or we see scary ""humans"" on screen. To top it off, this film is all about racism. Very rarely, does a film even try to balance the dichotomy. Crook does. At least try. Crook doesn't. Succeed. Crook over-compensates in the other direction. After a decent start with back and forth between characters who have different opinions on racism, the film goes overboard in villainizing the Indians. The film takes the 'clinical insanity' route to explain the fanaticism but it goes beyond the realm of acceptability and falls flat on the face. Similarly, the motivations of the protagonist and the film itself don't hold water because of how dramatic the situation gets by the end. Also, the problems, the issues, the situations, the dialogue all get very repetitive. Yet it's a bold film. Also for a change, I didn't mind watching Emraan Hashmi, he has a reasonable range of expressions. Neha Sharma certainly has a better screen presence than the posters give away. The rest of the cast was the usual combination of loud, filler caricatures. How I wish the balance they struck in the first half of the film didn't go so out of control in the last hour. Oh well...I've always had this question about the Indian-culture-nazis who live abroad. I finally get to ask it out loud - Why do people move abroad if they want to stay so Indian and hate the locals from the deepest place the gut is hidden?]"
707,"[Each of us has that one teacher, we are thankful for, when we look back - the one who made that subject interesting. And for every one of those teachers there are at least 10 not-so-good ones who kill our will to study. After all, what motivation do they have to be good teachers in this country? This is the backdrop against which Habib Faisal sets stage for the decaying system we are all becoming a part of. All in a fun manner using charming characters until the preaching comes in (all pun intended). Even a hint of a middle-class milieu in films and the first people I think of are Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee. No, I don't want to get into a comparison game, Do dooni chaar doesn't match up to any of their products and that's alright. It's just cool that it brings a smile by reminding me of my all-time favorite directors. So, with reminiscing done, we can begin appreciating what the other senior citizens are up to. Neetu Singh, what a brilliant choice for a comeback. The first time I heard of her return to films, I was weary - weary that she'll take up a role which puts her across as a wife-to-a-rich person and knows not what to do with her life. Then I saw the posters of her on a scooter. Along with a sigh of relief came another source of weariness. Is she going to behave poor while strutting around with the finest saris? A-la Hema-Malini-in-Baghban. Yeah-yeah I'm a very weary person. The flip-side though is that I'm still in awe of the simplicity with which she-played her easy-going character - calm despite repressed needs and all that goes with being an Indian home-mom. She reminded me of my mom. Not once does it feel that she was away for so long. And good movie or bad, I hope to age at least half as gracefully as these women are approaching the other side of 60. Also, it's brilliant that they didn't even seem remotely tempted to use the Rishi-Neetu history. Of course, there's Rishi Kapoor too. A-ha! Here's something I'm not weary of. Somehow, I'm always sure he'll do well as any character he has to play. O-kay, he didn't remind me of my dad, but some of his scenes with his kids are just the right amount of emotional. Another one with a student of his brought me to tears, despite being cliched, predictable and all that jazz. His acting and the writing - both of the situation and the dialogue - put together create such a perfect moments to get all misty-eyed. Even otherwise, the writing touches upon many varying issues. Here's the checklist - The irony of the joy of getting your own money back from a government agency; the supposedly inevitable and certainly gratuitous pot-shot at the media; the oblivion in which parents live with respect to the street-smartness of their teenagers; the irresistibility of the  ""keeping up with the Joneses"" game; and of course the whole comment on how the job of a teacher, the building block of any society is treated with little respect; meddlesomeness of parents even though the child knows the right thing to do; human nature of being dissatisfied; the  car salesmen, loan phone calls - not an exhaustive list by any means. Do dooni chaar is the coming of age of a family and the relationships within, despite individual limitations and their inadequacies as a family. It's mostly fun and emotional but falls into the pits of boredom every once in a while. ]"
708,"[Mr. Siddharth Anand and I need to have a word about lousy endings to films with decent starts and middles. That aside, I'm mighty pleased with the missing voiceover introductions. It also helps that there is no need for self-referencing with a producer who is not one Mr. Chopra. Worry not, I liked Anjaana Anjaani for the things that it is too. It is funny, it is crisp, it uses every-day, fun, and friendly quips to keep you laughing even though the story is not really moving on. I've always been allured to the topic of 'suicide'. Does it take more strength to end one's life or to face it? No, no, no there is no such deep philosophy being discussed in the film (except for one lame monologue attempted by Tanvi Azmi which the film could have so done without). In fact, the time devoted to the three acts is too staggered. It's like two hours into the two-and-a-half hour film there was a desperate rush for a conflict. The late arrival takes away from what could otherwise have been a wonderful and I daresay 'real-life' dilemma. A 150-minute film with only two main characters sounds excessive. This unjustifiable excess makes film seem slow and worse yet, banality of the characters' problems comes through. Suddenly, an issue that you could identify with comes across as self-obsession of the rich and the mindless. I'm not saying I want poverty porn, but fat fairy tale in party-land got tedious for a bit. Sure, Anjaana Anjaani talks about the last wish(es) and hints towards the meaning of life. It's all too superficial though. Because that concept is not the focus. It's just the thread holding the two characters together. These two characters get to know each other while we are getting to know them too. We are a part of their journey. They remind us of friends we have; those who get drunk and are more fun than ever; those who are hurting inside but are always making people around them laugh; those who we tolerate despite their self-obsessed sulking. Thankfully, there aren't too many side characters hovering around. Just imagine having to see pink-lipstick-hyperventilating friend more than the two minutes of his screen time. Sheesh. We already had Zayed Khan overstaying his welcome. Ranbir Kapoor, well, we are too accustomed to see him fall in love and realize it. He does it well without making it look like puppy love any more (despite his puppy eyes). So well, that I expect no less from him and give no extra credit when he meets those expectations. Tough luck, dude, bane of being a good romantic hero. O-kay enough beating around the bush! I cannot keep myself from raving about Priyanka Chopra any more. Wow! Has the lady eased into her role as an actor on this earth or has she? Her comic timing, lilt in dialogue delivery, pauses are just brilliant. Her smile has a screen presence of its own but she doesn't overuse it. When her eyes reflect the pain she's going through, you want to hurt the make-up person who glycerinated them. Of course, a lot of her dialogue delivery was possible only because of the dialogue. But, every once in a while it would go the cliche way, making the eye roll inevitable. Also the writing department seems to have taken a leave when the climax was being shot. Oops! I already complained about that. Well, it was that bad. It also hurt a bit that though the movie revolved around a woman, her life revolved around the men in her life. No career, no money worry, unabashedly dependent.  I guess I have to live with it being a story about a woman like that. Also, such a movie does annoying things to stick to mainstream formula while trying its bit to be different. Are we such snobs as an audience that we can't take our glam doll's hair out of place even when she is completely distraught? Do we have to snicker and make caricatures out of the queer? An urban tale about a generation that doesn't know its way around. You can identify with the problems and the way they are put forth. Even though it is difficult to react similarly or arrive at the same solutions.]"
709,"[I loved the last 30 minutes. There, I said it. I'll add finer details. The whole ""formation"" thingy was brilliant imagination and the execution mani-manifold better. I'd love to see that in 3-D. Did I mention, that it'd have to be in a much shorter film and the context would've to at least pretend to make sense? And there, I just threw away all the brownie points I was ever going to earn from a Rajni-fan. Damn! I have a very serious question. Where was Rajni in Robot? The cool formations I was talking about, where was Rajnikanth sir? As I remember from the last Rajni-film I saw, the whole essence of the film was that Rajni, the human being Rajni, could do all these cool things. Like say, flip a cigarette in the air, catch it right at the corner of his lips, after it is done with three summersaults, which of course happened because 'The Man' flipped it in air in the first place. Here the superpowers were adorned to the character, the robot. Let me elaborate further, see in Dabangg, Salman Khan played Salman Khan. So, even if I didn't like it, I could understand the high a Salman-fan would be at while watching him strut about. But here, I just don't get it. Why would a Rajni-fan want to see him do that as a Robot? Isn't that an insult to his very essence? Shouldn't it be something like 'Rajnikanth adds the R to obot?' Note that I'm not even complaining about the complete lack of logic or disregard to anything intelligent. Even the best special effect films need a thin boundary within which it needs to keep itself. I mean you create a robot to fight for the country and then have him talk to mosquitoes or cheat in exams or swim for a purse. How in the name of Rajnikanth is that cool? I vow not to complain about the lousy action sequences in the rest of the film, the ridiculous choreography and even worse lyrics and music. Palm refused to budge from the face whenever a song presented itself. Also note that I long dropped the wish to complain that for a while I thought Aishwarya Rai was the robot. How could I when the whole system was mechanized. At first, I got the feeling that the story was churned out by a machine. But I banished that thought as soon as I realized that the producer was abducted by a machine, which then took calls on how much money to pump in. Anyway, looks like the producer, like me, will not complain about the torture endured at the hands of a machine. Just heard from a cousin in Bangalore that tickets for Robot were selling for Rs. 10,000 in the black market today. Even if, the exaggeration is sliced down to 10%, does the buyer even give himself the choice of not liking the film?]"
710,"[When a film is so over-the-top and the situations are so exaggerated, I tend to look for the spoof in it; the underlying comment; the cynicism. And of course, left to imagination, it ain't too difficult to find it either. But, Khichdi is so crass, that even when I laughed, I felt yucky inside. It's not the toilet-humor kind of crass. It's absolutely (hopefully-miles-away-from-reality) insensitive crass. I guess, it's their way of saying nothing is worth taking seriously - neither deaths and funerals nor weddings; and certainly not respect for the older generation let alone each human. And while they are at it, as is in vogue these days, a potshot at the media and the education system too. As if darker the joke, harder were the writers laughing at how seriously we treat the issue in real life. And thus, you can find social and philosophical commentary on almost everything - from asking the creator of the universe about the scarcity of water, to a human's love for creating problems for himself - a lot of ground is covered. And most of it using juvenile humor better known as PJs (poor jokes or more appropriately lame pun jokes). My affinity for such humor is obvious. In real-life and as an audience, they are all equally greeted with eye-roll after eye-roll. Yet I appreciated the fluidity of the situations. A film like this could very easily have been episodic. Even the most expensive 'comedy' films from India are episodic. But, Khichdi at least has some semblance of cause giving rise to an effect, rather than a backward calculation. Also, given the genre, I guess the lot of actors did a fine job of looking into the camera while acting! My palm was stuck to my forehead all through a scene in which the characters are giving each other acting lessons.Aaaye-aaye-aaye-aay-aay. What will become of this universe? Someone please tell me, Khichdi's huge following on TV is a analogical poor joke. ]"
711,"[No one can say, ""Dabangg falls short of expectations."" - Salman Khan fan or not. The kind of 600-odd youngsters that come for an 8:30AM show; those who boo at trailers because they stand between Dabangg and them; they can't wait for their hero's grand entry - these people certainly fall in a skewed sample set. But they are the target audience too. Vouching for Dabangg, on their behalf, is easy. Thanks to the deafening cheers at every line Salman Khan mouthed and even at some non-verbal, action-packed sequences. Me? Well, I am an outsider in such a forum. I try to go with the flow but it just isn't my kind of film, Dabangg.Dabangg turned out to be what I thought it would be - Salman Khan playing himself (for he knows no other way); reasonable action; cheeky one-liners; good music; and loads of nonsense in the story but who cares about that anyway, right? In fact, I'll go out on a limb and say Dabangg even exceeded my expectations - Salman Khan plays Rajnikanth; there are a few awesome moves in the fight sequences; and the plot is loosely coherent. But then again, I'm no Rajni-fan either. ducks brickbat(s). At least, that attack on me isn't animated by some shoddy computer graphics. And they are not bad copies from various other films either. Also no chick editor snap and sew it together oh-so-quickly. Hey, who am I kidding, I ain't Salman Khan fan either.Every actor in the film takes cue from Salman Khan. Take one expression and stick to it. Be it Vinod Khanna or Dimple Kapadia. Oh, Sonakshi Sinha, she has two to switch between - disturbed-why-me and smile-when-my-admirer-wants-me-to. Her role seems to have gone under some heavy-duty scissors. Only that can explain the gaps in her character arc. Producer and item-numberer, Malaika Arora Khan makes a better impact on your memory than Sonakshi Sinha. Films of this genre can't be bothered by things like consistency and comprehension, and this one at least makes an attempt. Fails miserably, but tries nevertheless. It actually takes time to set the characters and their relationships up. The script goes on to build on this background, too. But, the rush to wrap it up shows. The urge to put in more action and less story, becomes transparent. Thus starts a race for the quickest character transition - be it good to evil or the other way around. The change is glaring at you even harder because of the extremes that each of these characters have gone to in the opposite direction. You remember the 80s.The broad plot tries to say something about national issues, from political to social, from dowry to bribery. But then they are left loose. Not that I want any preaching from anyone. But those elements don't find conclusion and that's sort-of disorienting. You leave with questions that didn't look like they were intentionally so.Oh, look at me trying to impersonate an intellectual fart. Go on people, go enjoy your annual dose of Salman Khan. I love to see people let their hair down, abandon care and just have a good laugh...or dance. Even if it is to the tune of a wannabe 'omakara' or 'beedi jalai le'. Oh, by the way, if you enjoyed the munni song, check this out - the original.]"
712,"[It's so exciting when you are watching a film and you start thinking of the specific people who you want to recommend it to. And it's such an anti-climax when you get out of the theater and the enthusiasm to spread the word has somewhat dithered. I don't really know if I can blame the makers for the climax because there aren't too many other ways the film could have gone. But, while Emotional Atyachar lasts, you are promised sharp dialogue from the world of sleaze. Thus you have been warned to the crass language and innuendoes. But the humor is quirky and comes and goes really quick, so you have to be attentive and of course get past the profanity. There are random little things which you might not remember later, but if reminded they are sure to bring a smile. Emotional Atyachar has an absolutely fantastic start. The spooky feel and range of characters builds and maintains intrigue. Right from the wannabe, Gujrati businessman to the muse played by Kalki Koechlin, each character is eccentric in one way or the other and it works. Yep! Even the stereotype works, because of the everyday yet witty dialogue. However, the film suffers the way any 90-minute film with so many characters would. Looks like an inexperienced person had some say in what parts of the story stays out of the film. In a film which otherwise had a decent flow, Emotional Atyachar has a few effects without any apparent causes. For example, why the businessman is refused funding or how does a character free himself after being tied down. The amateur editing also shows in the fact that the 90 minutes run-time is split into 60 minutes pre-interval and 30 minutes post-interval. It makes the film seem longer than it actually is. Which also means any longer and the film would have suffered. So, the editing was necessary but not necessarily done well. Despite that there is enough in the film to warrant a trip to the theater if dark, pulp-type fiction is your kind of entertainment.]"
713,"[I guess the point of Hello Darling is to bring the working woman's sentiment against the casting-couch-types out in the open. But isn't there a less crass way of doing it. If not, isn't there any new way to do crass? At least none involved in Hello Darling thought so.Where does one begin the complaints from? sighAfter having closed my eyes and mulled over that one for a bit, I think my biggest grievance is against the way the actors were used. I admit, I was a teeny-weeny bit excited with the news that my teenage crush (this was in the ""Videocon Flashback"" days) Javed  Jaffrey, is doing a male solo lead. I had hopes from the team that realized he could carry off a movie shared my belief that he can do more than slapstick. But, as you've guessed, that isn't meant to be. Not yet.Other than Gul Panag, the women though are not really known for their acting prowess. But looks like she too has been made to pull a page out of their book in shrieking and making faces which are irrelevant or exaggerate or both. I don't think it is their fault either, I think they did exactly what they were told to do.  And they clearly weren't asked to better themselves.Same goes for almost each department of film-making. The dialogue was what goes with the slapstick - cheap innuendoes, scurrying around, slaps and all. The songs were there because they are ""expected"" to be there. Actors who can't do the Bollywood dance bit are made to dance, and Javed Jaffrey is on the bench.I know one is not supposed to expect from films with posters boasting a man in boxer shorts. I know one is not supposed to expect much when the name, Hardik is spelled as Harddick. But the hopeful in me wants to like a film, wants to love it. Oh well, there's always a next time.]"
714,"[Aashayein stars 50 people whose days are numbered by some fatal disease. Almost all have come to terms with it. Some smile artificially. And a handful spit venom. How they coexist and come to love each other is what Aashayein could have been about. And I agree, that would have been plain boring and the base story needed something additional and Nagesh Kukunoor has that on the platter too. Just that the spoon-feeding of how and why it is different didn't entirely appeal to my taste buds. And of course they went berserk with the ""metaphors"" as the end approached too. Symbolism remains symbolism if it's left to interpretation. Some parts of the film feel like a 'Metaphor 101' class, to teach us, the ignorant audience, the basics of film-reading.  It is very painful to see a double and triple display of what the writer meant by showing a particular sub-pot, as if to make sure that even those in the audience dozing don't miss it. I was in awe when some of the metaphorical stuff started. But they rub it in too much and the charm goes away. Oh and, it becomes more and more ridiculous. So, it ends up making you laugh instead of making you think. Also the writer makes things unnecessarily awkward too often. Usually, I blame the execution for the uneasiness the actors/director felt in a particular scene. But, here the writing felt forced and you could sense how hard the script had to go against its nature to make room for a 'different' situation/action/reaction. A simple thing like a hug between two characters came across as if one of them is being forced into it. It almost felt like the writer was on an emotional up and down. He has created this world with different characters and their quirks. He digs a little deep into their emotions, panics at what he sees (also panics at this perception of the audience's reaction) and surfaces to breathe. And this jagged script becomes a pain to swallow. And all you remember is that pain and forget some of the most beautiful moments and relationships that he creates.Anyway. There is a takeaway from the film. Anaitha Nair, this little girl was the life of the film. She played the blunt, toxic, vulnerable, teenager Padma so casually, that you feel compassion towards her wicked character. Exactly what you are supposed to feel for her. That doesn't mean John Abraham didn't do well. It's just that, if a man is dying you are supposed to feel sorry for him, not drool at him. Emotions don't particularly show up very well when he tries them on. But the man tries hard, only problem is the effort is too transparent. A touch of humor in the dialogues,  the songs, especially the lyrics, and some of the close-up shots also go into the ""saving grace"" list. But...With a heavy heart, I have to say Nagesh Kukunoor doesn't crack it with Aashayein either. I wouldn't say the film starts off well. It has its share of cliche's, badly written scenes. Like the rest of the film, the beginning too, escapes under the guise of calling the action/dialogue filmy and doing it anyway. But there are glimpses of above-average thought - both qualitatively and quantitatively - being put into some of the scenes. There is hint of a soul and as fate would have it, the hope dies as the post interval period starts.]"
715,"[Sincere aplogies. To the writer, director, and actors for being so apprehensive about Lafangey Parindey. I made some promo-based assumptions that were completely off. And boy, am I glad!! It can be argued that I liked the film because my theories were thrown out of the window. What's done is done. I came out of the theater shaking my head in disapproval at the climax but with a generally happy feeling. And that's how the score stands. Lafangey Parindey is of course, a to-the-core love story. And there is absolutely nothing extraordinary about the one-line plot anyone would use to describe it. The climax is a forgone conclusion. Also like any of the basic seven stories that exist in the world, it's how the characters get where they are, their ups and downs that matter. Lafangey Parindey engaged and made me care for the protagonists. In fact, even a couple of side characters (Nina and Faizal) got me interested. Lafangey Parindey is a fairytale with the appropriate dose of villains, witches and simplified-real-life in their own little world. The main characters have shades of grey, which make them a little more interesting than your commonplace Jack and Jill. The villain is not all out bad but he doesn't go all-out soft either. Each of the characters get what I call, ""presence of mind"" dialogues - natural, use everyday language, have common-man wit in lieu of filmy-wit. Like some sudden but expected character-transitions are masked under a smart line or two - like a mom who doesn't believe in her daughter's aspirations suddenly calls her daughter phataakaa when she's successful. Some of the details in the writing give a nice touch to the second layer of the film. With an overt statement that each character has a person to look up to who they aspire to be like, there is a covert line pointing to the fact that none of the ""role models"" remain the person they used to be. It's disheartening then that the climax is a major let-down. The signs do start showing post-interval, but the nosedive into blah in the last 15-minutes came as a shocker. Or was it their way of catching us off-guard :)? What was with the sudden rush to wrap it up? Anyway, the characters engage you and that's where the film connects with you. Our hero, Nandu is played by Neil Nitin Mukesh, who could easily have passed off for a 'chocolate boy.' But, the writers recognize that this grown-up audience now needs their filmi heroes to be more than that. So, this once, the Mumbai milieu is chosen to add to Nandu's character and make him more palatable (too-sweet leads to diabetics after). And it sort-of, kind-of works. Neil has a range of expressions, which he does really well - confusion, awe, guilt, when he's keeping a secret, and a few more. Outside of this though, his face is frozen. His body doesn't move much anyways. Also, this range fits in Nandu's character - he's a hunk from the slums, who uses his muscle for an adrenaline rush and makes some money off that too. He hasn't given his future a thought, but can go from being a boxing fighter to a bar bouncer to what his girlfriend wants him to be, apparently very swiftly. Don't get me wrong, this is not entirely illogical, or out-of -the-blue. It is gradual, and an attempt is made to indicate motivation, albeit not entirely convincing. Under the 'not entirely convincing' headline will also be a 'Deepika Padukone in the tapori-world. Like I mentioned in the preview, the tight backbone, the long mane, the stance in general give away that she's not really a girl who lives a lousy life. But she makes up for, or let's make that - tries to make up for that with her attitude. Her character is a strong girl who won't take 'no' for an answer even from the Almighty. Yep! A proper mainstream movie made by an ad-film maker for a leading production house has a beefy role for the lead-lady. She has her entire range of ups and downs too. I wouldn't have imagined Deepika-Neil as a pair. Somehow, together they look like what aunties at weddings might choose to say about the marrying couple, ""He doesn't suit her"" or vice versa. But, mainly because of Deepika's performance, they seem connected and you want them to be with each other and live happily ever after. The side characters are a mix. You have Kay Kay Menon entering and exiting his role as if he owns the place - the hero's self-appointed caretaker (His make-up is also awesome.) And you have the unbelievable heroine's brother with no soul and mind. Also, the second half unnecessarily shows a couple of caricatured characters. The frames and the way they are edited make Lafangey Parindey look really slick. The music is contemporary and likable. The songs are choreographed with soul and are not the regular 1-2-3 jerks. The action, especially the bike-thrills spell - DO NOT TRY AT HOME. And the story in general is also, ""NOT TRIED AT HOME"" because the real world doesn't work this way. But along with the laugh-out-loud moments there is a warm, very human story inside. So, then just like it might be considered non-conforming to dislike the   new wave cinema  will it be considered out-of-fashion to like Lafangey Parindey for what it is? Ps. is it a criminal offence to have a hero wearing sunglasses that are not RayBan? #JustAsking]"
716,"[This is a film about Bombay, not Mumbai. It's a story about a smuggler, his lady love and his sidekick, and it's a rather filmy story. The movie is set in Bombay of the 70s, a Bombay that was slowly becoming the financial capital of the country, a Bombay that was home to everything filmy: including the underworld. Everything in the movie is larger than life, the dialogues are almost verse-like, the clothes are loud (it's the 70s!), the heroine's makeup is loud and what is most vivid is the romanticism of being a powerful don. The power play and slick narrative takes the audience in a roller coaster ride of one man's rise, another man's fall and a strong attempt to be stylish at it.The movie is told to us through the eyes of DCP Agnel Wilson (Randeep Hooda), where he tells us about Sultan Mirza, the most powerful don who arrived in Mumbai with the sea as a small innocent boy, who grew up to become a good-hearted don. It is clear that Sultan Mirza owns the city, loves the city and calls it his Mehbooba. Which is why he helps the poor and becomes a god like figure for them. The character of Sultan Mirza is precise and Ajay Devgan plays it with utmost conviction. He does a good job because we've seen him play a similar character in Company and he still manages to bring a sense of freshness to the character. Through DCP Agnel Wilson's memory we are told of Sultan's rise to power, how he respects the city by only smuggling material goods and not drugs, his love story with film star Rehana (Kangana Ranaut) and his discovery in Shoaib (Emraan Haashmi). His love story is as filmy as it gets, with a corny courtship period which lasts for 3 minutes, cheesy dialogues and song/dance routine albeit with a mature fading into the larger context of the film. Kangana is demure and looks the part of a 70s film star with all the bling and glitz. Emraan on the other hand, plays a younger Dawood Ibrahim in all sincerity. He is cheeky, arrogant and smooth in his ways, and serves as a good contrast to the mature Sultan Mirza. His determination to rule Mumbai and become the greatest power, gives us a dramatic look into what we see now, in the form of international terrorism via Dawood Ibrahim. The problem with the film comes when there seems to be not much of a build up between the king and his sidekick, as seen brilliantly in Company. Both character of Sultan and Shoaib are built very well, but the conflict is not acted out much after the intermission. More emphasis is given on punch lines for dialogues, which get tiring after a point. As an audience member, you expect more action than dialogues, and while the first half seems promising, the latter part of the film, including the climax, don't match up to the decently carved out first half. Kangana's character takes a backseat, Ajay Devgan becomes repetitive and Emraan becomes a cheeky slave to power, to a point of no belief. The performances are immaculate as they go with the overall feel of the film, it doesn't seem stale and convinces you in parts. Randeep Hooda is a raw change, in his confidence as a police officer, Ajay Devgan and Emraan Hashmi are cogent in their parts, but the film loses it edge through a script that creates a void with it's hurried climax and falling second half. Even the though the movie is out and out dramatic, at points the dialogues become too theatrical. Kangana seems sparkly and filled with potential but suddenly loses her screen presence in all the rush to make a drama out of a very narrate-able story. The background score is appealing, but the music seems a bit forgettable. The movie's obvious strong points are Ajay Devgan, apt characterization and a good story which could have churned out a better climax. Watch Once Upon A Time In Mumbai for the love of Bombay, Ajay Devgan, an entertaining story and don't expect to blown away. ]"
717,"[A 600-seater multiplex hall is filled to capacity for Peepli [Live] a film that has no stars, is about a remote village, and the promo material has made it obvious that one cannot expect any glamor out of it. We know now that the 'we serve masala because that is what the audience demands' days are numbered. fingers crossed Yes, the crowd seemed to be enjoying the film. I understand that 'enjoying' is a rude word to use when you are talking about a film based on others' misfortunes. But it seems only valid, when you see people laughing at dark joke cracked along with the huge roar of laughter every time a cuss word is used.Once the novelty of seeing everyday talk on screen wares off - the whole-range of Hindi foul language, the young easily-amused boys giggly girls do get involved in the rotten situation that our state is in - at least more involved than one could imagine most of them in reality. Pathos of the central character comes through without him having to speak more than 5-10 lines in all of 100 minutes. Such subtlety runs through Peepli [Live]and every once in a while reminding you of the moot point it's trying to make. The obvious commentary on the unintelligent coverage of issues by the media, to the absolute ridiculousness of Government yojanas (subsidy/benefit/upliftment programs) is continuously punctuated with references at the level underneath.  It is up to us then, to dig deeper. Going just a skin-deeper there's a ton to see: Contrast between two strong women - one urban, one rural - one empowered and 'master' of her life if not others, the other at the mercy of the feeble men in her life; suicide must not come easy to farmers close to death either; left to the mercy of news-creators a dying farmer's feces and Saif Ali Khan's smooch are competing for headlines - is everything that hunky-dory?; all is not lost for there is a conscientious young bureaucrat/politician/journalist out there. His soul has not on sale, at least not yet; there is more hope because the simpleton will rise and make his own decisions despite the entire world wanting to take advantage of his situation; and on and on and on. So many things are being said at once - using the lyrics, the music, the backdrop, the props - that in the first five minutes you decide to stop being overwhelmed as you promise yourself another watch to grasp more. This first time I decided to absorb the surface. The performances are so close to reality that it almost feels like a documentary. The focus is on developing and presenting the situation rather than building characters and their arcs. The photography adds to the 'real' milieu by having a home-video feel - with the intentional shakes and jerks. There are some exaggerations, no doubt. And they make the film a little too slapsticky for my taste and also for the tone of the film. Then again, they are only an extension of what we've seen in real life or read in the papers. The newsy nature and the manner in which the situation rolls out also makes the film predictable. So, what next? A teeny-weeny bit more than 'nothing'? If even one bureaucrat/politician just scratches his head after watching the film, [Peepli Live] should consider itself successful. Audience? Hopefully, it won't be mere fashionable to like the film. Hopefully, a few of us will go beyond our 'jobs'. Even if it's not to take on the task of improving a nation, at the very least we can begin and continue to be an audience that demands films out of the ordinary - be they good, bad, or ugly - Peepli [Live]is all three, not in quality but because of its gritty content.]"
718,"[Should I be happy that Aisha is all about a woman (Sonam Kapoor) and has a capable actor like Abhay Deol play second fiddle? Or should I be disappointed that the only thing Sonam Kapoor's character finds pleasure in doing is to look up a man for every female character to hook up with? Should the director be happy that she managed to achieve the ""Hollywood chick-flick"" effect? Or should she be disappointed only how far she could get? While I could take both sides on each of these issues, I'm sure of two things - I'm certainly happy for the subtle comments made, especially the ones on the battle of the sexes. But I'm equally disappointed that these were done randomly with no connection to story or characterizations thus far. So much so that, all the depth, the film could have taken a plunge into, seems frivolous and flaky. To express exactly where the superficial feel comes from, I can just say that 'look and feel'-wise Aisha had done complete justice to its inspirations - Sex and the City, Hannah Montana, and the likes. Ok, I'm not going to count how many toes I've stepped on, but usually society upward of upper middle class is, by definition, stereotyped by superficiality. That, in itself, takes the characters away a level or two from us. It's not that problems, of people who have moved up in the Maslow's theory of need pyramid, are not genuine problems or should be belittled based on a general moral principle. Who are we to judge that one's problems are more serious than the others'. But, my problem (you are free to judge how important it is) is that films like these trivialize the otherwise weighted issues. It's like taking away from the subject of the film. All this analysis might make you think that Aisha has some serious stuff going on. Naah. I'm just commenting on what could have been, especially given the light vein the entire film maintains. Serious issue, subtle humor - rarely fails. But every once in a while a major character in the film does something so totally out of the blue. The shocker is not something that doesn't feel real, it is just that most of us would say or do something like that with some sort of a history and not just because THE writer felt like it. Also, all the trump cards were in the director's hands. It wouldn't come as a shock to anyone if Sonam Kapoor actually lives a lifestyle like Aisha's. Maybe a little less of a meddler, but for most parts she has to behave like a kid who can't be bothered with credit card bills and such. SO, not much acting involved there. Would anyone argue that easy-going, Arjun is a stroll in the park for Abhay Deol? Ira Dubey was a pleasant watch too.It won't come as a surprise if most men will come out flaring at the women who got them in the theater. And many women might find it 'not bad'. At least, they saw some funky costumes. Me? Well, I wanted to love it, but didn't come out hating it either. The picturization of the lovely songs itself were enough to get me by.]"
719,"[One would expect the Priyadarshan and Akshay kumar combination to be able to come up with something potentially entertaining. For my sake, while standing in the line for tickets I was praying Khatta Meetha would be the funniest movie of the year. It wasn't. I'll tell you what surprised me, though. Not the fact that people were rolling over and laughing on stale jokes, not even that the first day, first show was almost housefull. It was mostly because the audience cheered loudly, whistles et al, at intervals of 5 minutes for everything Akshay Kumar said. All there is to Khatta Meetha are a bunch of hyperactive characters, trying to pull off a ""political satire"" with slapstick comedy and no storyline. It is a remake of Priyadarshan's original Malayalam film Vellanakalude Nadu, which was highly successful in 1989. Adapted to a Marathi setting the movie is about a notorious road contractor Sachin Tichkule (Akshay Kumar) and his journey through corruption and red-tapism. He struggles with his job, regularly cons people off their money, but it's Akshay Kumar. He is the ever so earnest protagonist who is only notorious because he needs to make the audience laugh. His comic timing is just about decent but the jokes are too stale. Priyan's stock characters, Rajpal Yadav and Asrani, are no better. Even his antagonists, Akshay's brothers and brothers-in-law, have negligible screen presence, and all their interactions take melodramatic, loud acting to a new level. Trisha Krishnan seems like a dummy in the hands of the script, or lack thereof. It seems like she was placed in the shoot and asked to recite her lines, because she constantly shifts between being the girl next door-wannabe abhla nari, and a curt municipal official. She carries off neither roles, nor certainly a role that commands for her to be taken seriously.The most frustrating part of the movie is how earnestly it tries to comment on contemporary corruption issues. Priyadarshan tries to pull it off by shifting in a jarring manner between loud comedy and even louder intense scenes. None of which seem to fit in the larger context of the film. Sure, the movie brings out the truth about road construction and dirty politics, but what's new about it? Rajneeti would have been a quieter option.Maybe we can give him some credit for trying, but I'm guessing that got washed away the minute we heard about the comparison between Sachin Tichkule and R.K.Laxman. For God's sake, they are not the voice of common men in the same way. Sachin Tichkule is Akshay Kumar with a good comic timing but no sense of a good script, loud dialogues, a few provocative songs and a blind audience following. The movie attempts to say a lot in the 2 and half hours it runs, but with repeated action. It's a cycle of noisy dialogues, slapstick jokes, cut to serious scenes with forced intensity and back to comic relief. The chemistry between Akshay Kumar and Trisha Krishnan is cold, with their constant bickering and his sexist attitude towards her. It seems like a bigger farce when they get together at the end of the movie, out of the blue, without any real explanation.The only thing that seems mentionable here is that Akshay Kumar carries off the common man attire in an apt way. When you see him in a dull shirt, a cheap pen in the pocket and chappals, you believe he looks the part. When he screams in frustration that he cannot to afford to pay any more money, amidst his bureaucratic mess, you understand. But that alone is not enough to pull the movie through. It seems dated because it might have been blindly adapted from 1989 to 2010. The setting seems old; the women characters behave like they live in the 40s and the social issues have been overdone. Remember Hera Pheri? Surely Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar are capable of much better.]"
720,"[3 issue-based films in a day - Two related to global political situations (Lamhaa and Tere Bin Laden ) and one addressing a social issue that needs immediate attention (Udaan). Lesson at the end of the day - there are two ways of looking at any matter of importance. Bear me for the colloquial usage - one is 'load leke' and the other 'chill maar ke' (seriously and the other lightly). Tere Bin Ladentakes the chilled-out route and how!! The snotty attitude that I have towards both slapstick and satire, I'd never have imagined I'd laugh even once at a combination of both. And when I wasn't laughing out loud, I was forced to wear a wide smile at the subtle references to current affairs. The tongue-in-cheek remarks hardly ever stop. If not words, some prop, or something in the background is vying to reach out to your funny bone. The sequences and situations also are one fun one after the other. And all this is happening while constantly making a remark on the futility of the war and the unashamed mask of righteousness people wear to justify killing each other. If not that the remark is on some stereotype. Every bit makes you realize how much thought has gone into making the point but without creating a drama, out of it. While the first half is setting the situation the second half goes into surreal or what we can easily call it a Tom &amp; Jerry affair. The transition is a bit disorienting.  But the so-silly-and-farfetched-that-you-have-to-laugh situations use dark humor, spoof of stereotypes, mockery of media, and ridiculing reality shows. They tickle, make you think, and get you worried about the characters, all in one go. I wish I could give out some of the brilliant understated statements made. I just wouldn't be able to take it on my conscience if I spoiled even one gag for you. All I can tell you is Ali Zaffar, a Pakistani reporter lands himself in a situation where he makes an Osama look-alike make a statement to the US. He puts together an entire crew - make-up artist, voice artist, editor, actor, and an executive-producer type. You can only imagine how crazy it can get if it is done right. And done right it is.May I thank you Mr. Abhishek Sharma for doing exactly what you believed in without heeding to supposed commercial requirements. No hero who has a heroine to woo, no over-the-top garishness just for the heck of it. I know it's a shame that we live in times that make us appreciate the things avoided in a film, rather than what it contains. But this once, we have a winner that has achieved both and more. ]"
721,"['Failure', 'Red mark of the family', 'Good for nothing' (naalaayak), 'Disgraceful' - Many of us must have grown up (or are growing up) with these words being used, often, instead of your name. Of course, we didn't enjoy it then or relish the memory now. Yet we wanted to be, neigh, needed to be in their good graces, irrespective of our definition of 'grace' or honor. Udaan is our life on screen. Even if you were one of many who boasted the 'best child of the universe' badge, you knew someone who was living through hell. You get the point? Watch it either way. :)Update: Theaters this weekend are shouting out to be booked and more. While Udaan touches the heart, Tere Bin Laden is some serious laughter magnet. Lamhaa loses out on novelty value and even more so in this august company.It's not like we haven't seen this story earlier. Amitabh Bachchan in Kabhie-Kabhie played Amit Malhotra who gave up his aspirations to be a poet and filled his father's shoes in the family business. Vicky rebelled against his dad in Sharaabi  for similar reasons. But in these films, this aspect was a backstory, a small part in the whole scheme. Udaan's beauty is that, this facet of humanity or lack thereof IS the story. And our story's hero, you and me is iconized by Rajat Barmecha. He's our suffering creative soul, Rohan Singh. The young debutant might not have a whole range of expressions at his disposal. But whatever he has, including his fresh, deep voice, is enough for a housefull theater to go, ""dude, no-no, don't do that you'll get caught"" or egging him to fight back against the arbitrary injustice. It could be Rajat's acting or the result of a strong narrative. Or it could just be the fact that we identify with him; or a combination of sorts. It could be his acting capabilities that gets the audience to cheer for Rohan when he slaps the wrong-doer. Or it could be the brilliant, arrogance portrayed by Ronit Roy; or the intolerable claustrophobia Ronit's character, B. Singh causes. All these elements work towards the goal of making a film with one powerful scene after the other. I watch an average of 6-8 movies a month, most of them in a theater. I can vouch that it ain't easy to get an ovation from people who have been in their seats for over 2 hours, watching a reasonably slow proceeding of events in a 17-year old boy's life. This despite, having two groups of dimwits cackling intermittently. This certainly wasn't because of what was on the screen, just bunch of inconsiderate film 'watchers'. This is relevant for an assessment of the film. Because in a serious film with strong sequences that are meant to develop both characters and relationship, it can be annoying and thus distracting to be interrupted by such hooting. And that the rest of us enjoyed the film despite this says a lot about the screenplay. The same reason applies to missing holes in the script. I wanted to know more about B. Singh. I am usually not the kind to demand too much backstory; I like the guessing and self-second-guessing. But here I needed a little more or maybe it's just that the everyday film has conditioned me into wanting a justification for the way things are. Me, the common man, needs a God to justify a part of how things work, and cannot accept the randomness of nature. Yep people, this is one of those films for which I'm ready to take blame for what I don't like. Anurag Kashyap, sir, your investment will bear fruit. If not immediately, consider it a part of buying during 'recession', this bud will blossom in the long-run. Not that you needed my reassurance, your product says it all.]"
722,"[After watching 2 brilliant films back-to-back,Tere Bin Laden and Udaan, I was all set for a hatrick. But Sanjay Dutt's slo-mo entry with loud background music showed my expectations their place. But my heart still hung on to the hope that Rahul Dholakia will surely make a strong commentary. And commentary it was. Lamhaa is a revision of Kashmir's saga from 1989 and a running description of how nothing has changed since then. It's not boring but doesn't get you involved except for the last reel or so, where the atrocities of the jihaadis are very effectively slapped on your face. It is arguably an insurmountable task for a film to address the nexus of one fascist faction, another faction, Indian government, Pakistani Government, idealists, military, and the common man - each of them with their aspirations, filled with back-stabbers and double-crossers. I'd assume it is only understandable for the film to rush through this all without much attention to details - characterization, plot and pace. But this is accompanied with a notion of typical, shrill music in the background and dramatization techniques  that should be reserved for infant-amateurs. And that is like drawing one more straw, if not the last one. The last one would be the predictable dialogues. It was disheartening to see actor after actor repeat the same thing in the same words over and over again - ""No one cares about Kashmir and her real issues, everyone has their own agenda masked by some altruism."" What starts out as a history lesson, ends up in an attempt to brainwash us with repetitive mention of the current state of affairs. Within this, the name 'Strong' and its derivatives are used so many times that you get desensitized to the beauty and the terror of those 2 syllables. (Geeky joke warning: Someone seems to have briefed the writer that google ranks videos according to number of times a word is repeated in its content!) So in line with dialogues that exist as filler, as if a silent frame is penalized, there is a choppy screenplay. The performances aren't out of the ordinary, nor are they extraordinarily bad. Anupam Kher, of course, comes out really well as the inspirational leader. Kunal Kapoor is more or less flat as the principled leader of the masses. Bipasha's emotional outbursts are very involving. But she neither brings glamor quotient nor does she fit into the role of someone who has grown up in a conservative environment. She's too straight and her gait too city-girl like to be entirely convincing. You could've taken all of this in your stride if the story that evolves in the second half came a little earlier. In the attempt to start macro and narrow it slowly down to one event, the writers lost track of time. From characters that represent entities the plot gravitates towards individual A&amp;Os. This focus on people that belong to a group is very intriguing, but it's too little, too late. It is remarkable that the vanity of an issue with global repercussions comes across, despite all the flaws. By the end, your heart goes out to the Kashmiris and you are touched. And that, is Lamhaa's true success.]"
723,"[Different story, different issue, different aesthetics, different acting by lead actors - a film deserves applause just for doing this. Now it's a different story that it doesn't completely connect or make you care for the characters let alone the issue at hand. A lot seems missing despite what looks like best efforts.I'm not asking for a more complete coverage of the events in the regions facing Naxal protests. Considering that Red Alert tries to maintain balance between the two perspectives, asking for anything more is way beyond a 2-hour film's purview.  I'm not complaining about the pace at which the events unfold. In fact, it is a wonderful depiction of what an unwilling member of a rebelling faction goes through. How like in any other group, peer pressure makes him do things he's not convinced of. He might seem like the 'group idiot' but he does have an opinion, a balanced thought-process which has withstood brainwashing. And he's brave too. I understand and appreciate all of this and yet the pathos doesn't come through. One could have blamed Suneil Shetty's performance for the 'something missing' feeling, but that doesn't seem fair. He holds one expression, and maybe that's the only expression his character needs. It's something about the writing and portrayal of this character that doesn't completely make me root for him. This would have been a great reaction to have if he were a gray character, but that's not true either. The rest of the characters are very superficially described. Like every other Hindi film, their tranformations and character arcs are far from convincing. Given these pre-defined changes, the acting though, takes the pinch away. Kudos to Sameera Reddy for the complete shift in image. The rest of the cast has always been appreciated for their accomplishments. I'd say this film works as a documentation of the times and situations we live in. Our apathy towards what our eyes don't see and what doesn't affect us directly. Our ennui with every-day headlines that make it to the newspapers. Also, you cannot miss the comment on futility of war - even if it is within the boundaries of one country. And in this atmosphere is the story of a simple man who is constantly interrogating himself and those around him about the rationalizations of their behavior. Ps. I'll skip the notepad section for this one because it's the intention of making the film that I'm convinced about and I cannot make myself look for the loopholes in the script or presentation.]"
724,"[A city-bred girl wants to make a successful career out of being a housewife. Her ultimate goal is to mother two kids. Fair enough, that's plausible. The same city breeds this guy who has had an easy life and makes the most out of it by drinking, smoking, and lying. Acceptable. Destiny brings them together. Credible. Answers to how, when, where, are all creative and borderline believable, especially when you accept your fate of having to face cinematic liberty in all its glory. And yet, these parts don't add up to a 'must watch' or even a 'will watch some time.'When you have destiny as your excuse, nothing really needs to make logical sense, right? Weird, whacky coincidences happen all the time. And despite that, the Milenge Milenge writers have gone to laborious lengths (about 50 minutes) to make a 'chance meeting' happen. That effort we have to acknowledge. But, the trouble is with the unevenness. Amit and Priya get some things so easily and predictably. Some transformations of people around them happen without any effort or reason. But then again, who are we to expect fate to deal an even hand. With romantic Hindi films, you can usually tell within the first 15-20 minutes which direction the film is headed and what are the possible climaxes. It's just the 'how you get there' part that makes it interesting. And that is done with a few decent and engaging anecdotes here. But, the other part of the how, the visuals, the feel of the film is like that of a fabric that irritates the skin. Primitive camera work, Hindi soap-opera-type background score, Himesh-Reshammiya-style nasal title score running through the film, inane lyrics, music from the 90s, kitschy dialogues for otherwise interesting situations, other situations which are lame on their own merit, and more such stuff - add up to a ""when will this chase to meet be over?"" feel. And this is extremely sad because Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor actually do a decent enough job. The playfulness and pain comes through as much as the script allows it to. And you begin rooting for the couple, but Milenge Milenge's script actually doesn't let you get that involved. Especially in the latter half, an arm's length distance is maintained between the audience and the characters. Yet, it'd be unfair if I wrote the film off completely. I have a feeling that as superficial as the story is, it connected to me, maybe by just a thread, but it did. And who knows, it might just have worked in the days of (Jab We Met.]"
725,"[I hate sinking feelings. And I hate them even more when they have come after a happy spell. Exactly what I hate LUV stories did to me. The only difference is that it was the reason for the happy spell too which had an untimely death. If you haven't gotten it yet, this one is your regular love story, despite all the dressing up. The cute quips and the charming one-liners make you smile all through the first half, save maybe the first 5-10 minutes when the lead pair's voiceover is reading you their story. You actually start caressing the hope that the film might actually be 'different'. Only the wishful thought is muscled to pulp in ultra s...l...o...w motion as the second hour begins. The silver lining is that the film doesn't entirely lose its sense of humor even when the going gets bad. Post-interval too, the everyday humor stays and that's truly a relief from the ping-pong ball treatment accorded to the audience.Also fortunately, Imran Khan and the music/lyrics/picturisation of the songs keeps you entertained through the trauma. Imran has certainly added well to his range of expressions. Only he has too perfect a face to be a chocolate hero and thus a non-believer in love doesn't quite suit him or rather he failed to get that across. Sonam Kapoor is plain, stiff, flat and I'd like to say expressionless but I can't because of the one expression she maintains.I'd have loved to brand all love stories as hateful, but we've seen some decent ones. And I'm not talking about the traditional MPKs, QSQTs, and DDLJs. The urban takes on the subject - Love Aaj Kal, Wake Up Sid, Luck By Chance, Bachna Ae Haseeno, Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na - have not been bad. But remaking all of them and a few more in one film and that too under the guise of a spoof, doesn't really make it a new story. Note that 2 out of the 5 mentioned are from the LOVE GURUS Yash Raj Films and Dharma Productions and 2 others are spoofs.Statistics, oh well. I can churn out many such numbers to no avail. A good film is one which doesn't rid me of my happy feeling or at the very least wins the make-audience-happy vs. screw-audiences-gray-cells battle. Let's just say the wait for a good film has become just about bearable thanks to I Hate LUV storys. I hope this is the lull before the Hindi filmmakers will hit us with a huge storm. Waiting. . .]"

727,"[The primitiveness of the ""Arranged marriage system"" troubles the urban youth but is certainly a fallback option for those who cannot find an alliance for themselves. Yet the discomfort doesn't go away. Films, especially Marathi films, have now and again tried to come up with novel ways to deal with this awkwardness. Mumbai Pune Mumbai is one of them and despite its impracticalness, the idea has potential. Besides the basic one line concept, the dialogue between two complete strangers is written really well and delivered in a decent manner too. The chemistry shared between people who have just met but for some reason or the other end up spending a day together is beautifully directed and enacted. While Swapnil Joshi behaves more like a 15-year old but it is fairly easy to ignore those moments considering his character's insight about relationships. The effort the writers have taken to address issues in a relationship is obvious. Concepts like being ""too loyal to ones' emotions"" or showing relief that a guy senses when he realizes that the crying girl is not upset because of him are some examples of the nuances captured. Ironically, the writing department is also one of the few issues that keep it from being a must-must watch in the theater. Almost as if to justify the title of the film, the Mumbaikar-Puneri fight is taken a bit too far. The other puller-downers are a little less basic. For example, the way in which the only song in the film was shot. It looked like the song existed because the lead actor refused to accept the role if he were going to be in the same outfit throughout the film. Another snag was the camerawork in some scenes. It felt like the cinematographer got bored of taking straight shots and resorted to weird angles just to entertain himself. Despite the above issues, the theory by itself is interesting enough to make it to your 'to watch' list. Especially, if you are on the hunt, the arranged marriage way.]"
728,"[The wait for a high-octane, all-engrossing drama just became longer. But, that still doesn't mean we don't have a decent watch in hand with Raajneeti. The set-up is certainly complex and intriguing. And there are a couple of sly and conniving twists, no doubt. But, the depth is still missing. It's almost as if introducing the characters and their connections was an end by itself and not merely the beginning nor the means to get there.Given that the characters are based on Mahabharat, it would take real skill to make them uninteresting. So, are all the characters here. In fact, if you focus only on that angle, you'll see even more curious amalgamations. For example, Nana Patekar's character, Brij, is more Krishna, but has shades of Shakuni mama and a little bit of Bheeshma too. Made me think a bit about Krishna's manipulative tactics too. And after a while, these analogies can burst out of their seams. It's best to leave these aside and just watch the film for what it is. It would also help to keep Corleones, Gandhis, and Thackerays at bay. As glaring as they are, they only serve as distractions. And despite so much potential for complexity, the lack of details along with the creativity-challenged treatment offered to some of the situations gives you the heebie-jeebies. And as almost always, the negative lingers longer than the positive. Some of the scenes, like the one in which a character is introduced just after the previous scene alluded to him; or sundry women getting pregnant; or a woman falls in love with the ""arranged"" husband after he respects her wish not to be touched. Such scenes clearly didn't belong here; or the on-the-face references to the mythological epic. Oh yeah, and not to mention the deranged ""item"" number. Also with the various connections and cross-connections, the film deserved a lot more in terms of flow from one sub-plot to another instead of a ""my turn-my turn"" shout-out by the characters whenever they were made missing-in-action for a bit. Then there were other things that didn't go with the tone of the film like say, Prithvi's (Arjun Rampal's) sudden eccentricity. It was almost as if to say Arjun's otherwise wooden facial muscles can be chiseled into this other form - Exhibit A, B, and C presented as proof. To be fair, he was doing a decent job till then. The other usually plastic face is Katrina Kaif. Not in this one, at least in some parts. But all of you who are going to the film to see the surreal vision of the diva in a sari, please pass this one. The bits you see in the promo are almost all of what you'll see in the film too. The film is all about Samar and Ranbir has certainly carried off the chameleon-skinned character well. My complaint though is against the almost Jekyll and Hyde conversion without any symptoms of the disorder. Many of the other actors mostly retain their first expression, despite having fairly gray characters. This almost 3-hour affair doesn't slacken but doesn't keep you waiting for the next move either. Because somehow there's a foregone conclusion given the epic characters the film is based on.]"
729,"[Perdon , Hrithik Roshan fans. Really sorry, your wait for a good Hrithik film just got longer by a few more years. The setting is beautiful and so is the cast. The beginning also makes you eager. I was completely bowled over by the rugged and necessary clueless look Hrithik wore in the opening sequence. And this was despite the absolutely captivating cinematography. The standard set by the beginning was really exciting. Hrithik is in trouble in the sandy deserts of Nevada, we don't know why. His voiceover introduces us to the small-time crook that he used to be on the strip in Las Vegas. But, all doesn't end well. I'm ok with the climax by itself, but getting there was like being on a sedative.I won't say that it went into downhill mode immediately after the first few minutes. Dramatic editing crept in once or twice, followed by the mandatory song and boggling dance by Hrithik-Boneless-Roshan. These hints should have warned me not to take the film too seriously, despite the obvious effort. And there were a few more too. But, the interval felt like it came much earlier than expected and that's usually a good sign. The pace was just about perfect - the romance lingered and I could sense my ""aawww""; the mini-twists came with quick and sharp jerks. And I was really looking forward to an enjoyable fare. But you must have guessed how this story went. The thing is, a cliche is a cliche in any language. It remains so even if is in the sexiest accent. And it continues to bear the same character even if it is sub-titled. The dialogue is pretty much inane. And while there are some really cute moments and there are others where you can see the attempt to make it ""different"", there are some very ""typical"" situations. Usually, a premise for a film or any story, in fact, is set up. Like say, ""What if an Indian boy meets a Mexican girl?"" And then you play around with the possibilities. But here it's more like esimerp (ok, sorry, bad one!). It's all reverse engineered. Looks like first came marketing - Rs. is passe, $ is what we want - and make ourselves sincerely believe that we are doing it to bring Indian cinema to a world audience. Next, let's have this particular climax of the half-dozen ways in which a romance can end. Now let's play conflict-conflict. Eureka let's twist the standard by 2.5 degrees. Caste no bar, money no bar, religion no bar, whole-freaking country no bar. Let the objecting parties be a third person's family! And let's chop from situation to situation whenever we cannot get any more unreasonable. I shudder to think what the shorter English version will be like. Though the non-linear narration is used with style to create interest, the focus is at the wrong place. The ""what's happening now"" was much more interesting than ""how we got here"". But, the weightage given to both the sections needed to be reversed. Also, the twists that come in the last half an hour are lame and predictable due to the one-dimensional characters created. Kabir Bedi, Nick Brown and Kangna Ranaut is trying hard to be dysfunct. The ""trying"" part is because this section of the cast is too stiff. Every emotion is pretentious. And anyway, even if we feared the villains  the story completely punctures the anticipation. Hrithik and Barbara Mori do a fair job. The thing is that they look so good, that half their work is done right there. The rest of the stuff is taken care by tight close-ups. So, no body language needs to be used. Some of these tight shots work really well. Eyes mating, excitement brewing between the couple, the urge being kept under control unwillingly - all come out brilliantly. The kisses and making out are done with utmost comfort and is a much needed skill in Hindi films. On the flip side, was this done just to give the film an international appeal? If so, that's pretty lame, because they've been there, done that. Literally and figuratively - without the ""supposedly"" Indian moral bindings of undying love. Maybe that's what crossover cinema is all about. snicker Kites has super-slick production. Ace photography, definitely apt background music, intelligent editing, decent acting. I just cannot take anything away from the fact that it has outdone Love Story 2050, Blue and Drona, in terms of hopes created for high-budget visuals/effects and actual product.Uhhh, but...story, por favor?]"
730,"[Remember the Hindi movies of the 70s? The villain would be a moneyed sleazebag whose ill-gotten gains were the result of his smuggling activities. As the decades rolled by and the Indian politico-commercial environment changed, the smuggler was relegated to the role of a side-character, often the comic relief who would explain his livelihood as 'import-export ka business' accompanied by a shifty-eyed look and knowing nudges from those who knew what that was a euphemism for. More than a decade later, Bollywood takes us on another tour of the psyche of this interesting character referred to as the 'smuggler'. Badmaash Company is a story of four people who board the express train of get-rich-quick schemes and where it takes them. A number of dubious schemes and their execution keep the audience entertained during the first half. At this juncture, I did wonder whether the director had run out of steam and if the movie would falter once the crime-gags were done.In the second half, the story turns to the characters themselves and their relationships with each other. The movie transitioned well from witty to a somber ending. The slight Dil Chahta Hainesque note (the Badmaash Company is actually called 'Friends &amp; Co.') is concluded quite neatly. By the end, it more like a coming of age story. Shahid Kapoor essays the transition from a starry-eyed youngster to a cocky, hardened man-of-the-world with subtle grace. The potential glimpsed in Jab We Met and Kaminey comes into its own with this movie.Badmaash Company is contemporary in that the protagonist is shown in grey shades instead of the stark moralistic caricatures that were shown in movies made in 90s. Most people of this generation will be able to identify with the clash of attitudes with the earlier generation, the burning ambition and quest for fame, power and money, the disillusionment and even the peace that the characters make with each other and their choices.Despite the multiple issues that Badmaash Company seeks to address, it is quite light and easy to watch. Real-life witticisms like ethnic jokes, pop feminism and friendly banter (digs at movie stardom dreams) keep us grinning as the story unfolds. After the long dark teatime of the cinemagoer's soul on account of the IPL, Badmaash Company comes as a welcome shout back into the theatres.]"
731,"[8.30 AM. 600-seater theater. Housefull. Ok-ok almost housefull, but it was mandatory to use the name, right? So, now that we are done with that, let me tell you, I'm not kidding. The theater had barely 10-15 vacant seats. And the other 585-590 seats were laughing/hooting/whistling/clapping - basically being happy they are in a theater and there is something half-half-decent on the screen.Of course, there was this one person who was just thoroughly relishing the fact that people around her were completely involved in the chaos and enjoying the experience to the hilt - yours truly. I'm not saying I didn't like the film at all, but I couldn't call the film engrossing or 100% entertaining. It was just about alright. I laughed really hard a few times. But, not as much on a mind-blowing, insides-rattling joke as I did due to the silliness of it all. I mean what else can you laugh at when people suffer an electronic shock and that, moves on to become a dance. The nutty absurdity is not restricted to one-off incidents. While the first half introduces characters and builds relationships, the second half is spent in rewiring all the connections. Whose wife is whose sister is whose daughter is whose wife...or something like that. Yeah, such comedy of errors and mistaken identities have potential for loads of laughs. Housefull is neither devoid of them, nor...well, full of them. Of course, it's the standard loud, is almost a tolerable variety of over-the-top and it defies logic at every chance it's given. Out-of-job characters or characters with presumably low-paying jobs spend money like they are Midas. Other characters who are supposedly rich, make you wonder how such low-IQ people could get so far. Oops, look at me getting caught up in trivialities. The idea is to have fun, and well it is not a complete loss on that count. Had the performances been a little more subtle and a little more consistent, it could have easily been a fun ride through the run time. But, as usual, while the dialogues are on a consistent roll, the events are rather sporadic. Similarly, while the comic timing of most of the actors is brilliant, the individual scenes are not necessarily strong enough. The three men do their usual thing. National award winner Arjun Rampal, in his bit role, looks very uncomfortable trying his shot at comedy. The women on the other hand look good, alternate between shrieking and sort-of superficially expressing a sad/romantic emotion. I love the way Deepika Padukone carries herself in the skimpiest of clothes. Yep! There's loads and loads of that. And those who are going there for Jiah Khan, well, bother not. She barely has a cameo. I know it's been a famine of big-profile releases. I know you want to rush to the theater given the slightest excuse. But though it has those mindless, silly laughs, I don't have the heart to recommend that you spend money and time on what it takes for a family to go to the theaters. Time spent on it when it's out on TV/DVD though might be well worth it.]"
732,"[A producer who casts not his son, or his grandchild, but himself in the film, has to be desperate. And watching Dr. Anuuj Saxena's non-acting non-skills, it seems to have crossed a really high threshold of desperation. I mean, if I want him to go back into coma after he's been in the vegetable condition for half the film, there's something wrong with this Doctor, no?Ok, if not that, then at least the fact that Udita Goswami is being cast as a nurse who wears pink, tight mini-skirt and top, should give the desperation away? Actually, I shouldn't be so caustic. At least there was an attempt at having a story and half interesting characters. But, I guess you can sympathize with me having to spend 100 minutes watching Udita trying to act sexy. I'm just praying my dreams won't feature her. Or the other woman, Tareena Patel. Or any of the men. Least of all the police officer with the lisp or the main lead with his God-awful diction. Oops, I already complained about him, didn't I? Well, the point is that the story was not half bad, but there were way too many continuity jerks. Especially, in the action sequences. An action flick has to have action that I can see an appreciate to be slick. But in this one, it's more like the tight budget and editing tools were used more to cover the difficult-to-do action sequences rather than make it a fast-paced thriller. Oh well, another one that can be skipped unless you have absolutely-absolutely nothing to do.]"
733,"[It is difficult to shake of the thick legacy of mill-worker-era films like Roti, Kapda, aur Makaan and Namak Haraam. And I'm sure there were more films on the issue that I haven't seen. And despite having seen all of this at least 20 years ago, ironically, it was refreshing to see the concept on screen. But that's where the freshness ends. It then turns into regular Manjrekar-ization of the topic. Loud, louder, and if you haven't heard it yet, loudest.The degradation of the Indian - read Bombayite - moral fiber to barely threadbare in the early 80s - be it sex or violence. The cause being identified as globalization and commercialization of semi-public property. The collateral damage due to the transition from semi-socialism to capitalism - the entire value system. All this heavy stuff is crammed in 2.5 hours. You'd think that that would make the film fast-paced and interesting. Unfortunately, it's all done in a way that doesn't touch you. It can be argued that the film might make a better impact on people who were actually affected by the mill-worker strikes, but what's a film that doesn't make you identify with characters that are unlike you?I completely appreciate the gray shades given to each and every character. But their haphazard behavior and choppy way of moving from one sub-plot to another or one issue to another, is extremely exasperating. Not to mention, it completely highlights the confusion the makers seem to struggle with. What deserves more weightage? The mill-workers' political situation? The impact it has on the spouses and the children of these mill-workers? The demonization of corporatization? What? What?? What???And then, you top it off with some loud acting, blaring sound design and shocking visuals. A sample of the last is situation of poverty and desperation reaching such an insane level that violence makes the youth, the nation's tomorrow, cannibals and masturbators-in-public. I understand the frustration that Mahesh Manjrekar tries to convey, not only in this film, but all his films. And I value the courage it takes to follow through on showcasing the exasperation he feels or rather he thinks the audience ought to feel. But such on-the-face, over-the-top execution makes me wait for the interval after the first half hour of the film and for the end-credits, post-interval.Sure, the generation born to (and after) the generation which struggled for the basics - food, shelter, and clothes - needs to be sensitized and made aware of the cost at which the luxuries to them have come. But, this one only succeeded in repulsing me from the subject. ]"
734,"[I don't remember the last time I walked out of a theater and felt like I've left a different world behind. Not a world that I want to go back into any time soon, but that's not because of the quality of what I saw in there, it's the shocked and the fright my insides felt. It might have accentuated because somewhere, deep down I was expecting to watch an unintentional comedy. To my credit it was absolutely justified. But this one turned out to be a chiller. So, what if there was zero-thought in its story. Oh, by the way, the film is not directed by Ram Gopal Varma. Just saying.Phoonk 2 creates a lot of shrieks, if not out loud from the audience, at least a jerk or a shudder every once in a while. And this is all on the basis of the camerawork, sound design (though almost always, it's on the louder side), make-up and taking the suspense to an almost intolerable high. Though in a large chunk of the first half, the thrill peaks got very annoying. Later, as you get used to it and the movie moves forward inch by inch you get sucked into the drama. The writing, characterisations, and worse of all - continuity are all way beyond comprehension. The first half is used to establish that each of the characters is scared to the last nerve by an unknown and they sense something spooky doing the rounds. The second half has all these characters either getting beaten up or killed brutally by this unknown. Yes, it scares you. Not because you care for the protagonist and his family. But more because the unknown creates a completely suffocating environment. And maybe that is the film's success. But there are way too many things left loose. And here I'm not complaining about stuff that remains unexplained. I didn't let the 'why's bother me. For example, I very forcefully ignored the omnipresent, evil spirit's graciousness in allowing characters to mourn the dead for the longest time. It's the 'how's  that became too distracting. Like, can the said unknown scary unknown, with the said powers be at the same place twice? There are jerks in continuity like day turning into night and vice versa with no logical flow. And I'm one of those who didn't have a problem with the dark climax. In fact, it was very Harry Potterish. Of course, the movie wouldn't have had half the impact had the performances not been to the mark. Except for the overacting exorcists, the rest of the cast did a decent enough job of getting scared and thus scaring us. A lot of what worked for the film is because of the make-up department and the cinematographer doing an awesome job. Phoonk 2 had me in a 'job to get done' mode before it started. That turned into cynicism, in the first half hour, with every scene that moved slowly with music reaching its climax every five minutes. And absolutely unexpectedly, it started creating jitters. And that kind of anxiety doesn't give me a kick, which is why horror is by far my least-liked genre. Even so, usually super-natural horror stories don't scare me easily. This one did. I wanted the spirit to go away, because at some level I could identify with the family it was causing such agony to. If you really like that kind of horror, you could go for it. I doubt a DVD watch will do justice to the cinematography. If like me, getting terrorized - by the dead or alive - is not your idea of cinema, the IPL is still on, not only on the sports channels but on the news channels too!]"
735,"[""Oh look...what's that? Batman! Because this looks like Gotham city!!"" ""No""""Oh wait! Spiderman!! He's spewing a web from his wrist!"" ""NO!!!"" Damn!! It's the new bloke on the block called Prince...and he's no charming superhero in disguise, he's just a common thief trying to act ""yo..kewl"" and all that jazz!It's actually humiliating to me as an audience to start thinking about a film in terms of, ""Which complaint should I start with?"" Action, direction, acting, casting, songs, music, plot, dialogue? The deeper stuff like characterization I'll not even get into giving the genre a benefit of doubt. Just because we have seen worse, doesn't make this one anywhere close to watchable. sigh Anyway, here we go...The base plot itself had many-many interesting possibilities. A character loses his memory. He possesses a valuable that is of immense importance to smugglers, police, crossers and double-crossers alike. We haven't the foggiest why they all want it, but obviously all of them are waiting for him to recollect where he's kept the piece. There's so much there could have been done with the mind games played and cunning plots. But no, we are fed some humbug about memory being forcefully removed and some inexplicable ""medical science"" thingy with which it can come back or something like that. I don't care because I'm not made to care. Story - strike out. Action film it is, and how could I even begin enjoying it, if the only thing I could think of for the first 20-25 minutes is, ""Exactly how silly must Vivek Oberoi have felt doing this stuff in front of the green screen?."" Including the dances! They are inserted like they used to be abruptly ages ago, just for a break from the seriousness of the other stuff going on. Many action films also bank on the suave lead characters and the memorable lines they are given. You got it right, Prince is not one of those many. It has Vivek Oberoi for goodness sake! Ok, let's grant that you know with cool clothes and black shades he can pass by as stylish. But, the women! Even though they have potentially, half-way interesting characters, they are extremely annoying to say the least. Their make-up, hair-do and costumes don't help the cause. So this character who loses his memory, regains consciousness and says, Main kaun hoon? (Who am I?)...Main kaun hoon, main kaun hoon!?! For goodness sake!! The last I heard these words said in this situation was in a film from the 90s. I guess we should just thank them for not following it up with the ever-so-oft used main kahaan hoon? (Where am I?) ... Geez!! I guess that's the question left for the audience to answer. No not the existential ""Who am I? Where am I?"" The very physical ""Who am I? Where am I?"", once they have gotten up from their deep slumber. Oh wait! But we have more sleep to look forward to! Yes, Prince 2 threatens to come our way with open arms.]"
736,"[What IS love? A movie, which has its protagonist arrive, all the way, from Venus (yes, the planet) to find out how humans fall in love should have answered that question, neigh? Apparently, love is that flimsy thing that moves on from one person to another in no time, for an equally flimsy reason. It can be argued that the film proposes that, such flimsiness occurs only till one finds 'true love'. But only a few of us will delve that deep into the movies altruistic purpose. For now, the take home is, ""if you love someone, tell them quick!""One thing I really appreciated about the film...No, I'm not being sarcastic!...is that the 'other' guy is not a lame character. He is the kind who can woo a girl and is not playing games to win her approval. This is such a welcome and refreshing change from the ""Loser"" or ""crooked-minded"" 'other' guy we see in our films. This one 'different' characterization and Riteish Deshmukhs's performance are about the two things that make this movie just about watchable. But, that too is to be taken with a pinch of salt. Interesting characters are a necessity not a luxury, so why should an audience have to thank the makers for one. And once a possibly engaging situation is created, you still have to take it further and hold you on till the climax. No such luck, here. You know the outcome well in advance, and the rest is just a formality. Formality is also what the other actors seem to be doing with their characters. The women have to look pretty and be the chirpy-bubblies to distract from the fact that there is actually no real plot. They do look pretty, but that's about it. They are not even granted a few of the mush-gush ""snore-snort worthy"" romantic lines that the men are ordained with. What's left then, is filled with supposed-comedy. A sample is Kaushal, Rajesh's (Riteish Deshmukh's) friend's interest in all things sex. Just that one single track running through his mind is apparently as Rajesh's alter-ego. If they ever did, I'd think those jokes worked like 10 years ago. I assume, the youth towards whom the film is targeted, has better humor than that. And their idea of love. Oops! Did I just admit that I'm too old for such tripe? I hope not, for the future of comedy and romance in our cinema, I hope not. ]"
737,"[The tagline of the film says ""The unbearable lightness of being"", a lovely book by Milan Kundera. But, I couldn't figure how that relates to the film. All I can do is the make this superficial observation - it is anything but light.The film starts with the a child-star's mom being devil-incarnate. And there is one more. Now, these moms are absorbed in their need to live vicariously and imposing their aspirations on their children. So absorbed that they are not only willing to sacrifice their child's sexuality, but also their sexual orientation. The focus here though is the mental trauma that the child goes through. Ominous stuff this. Enough for me to say aloud, ""can we please stop this? NOW...""The hallucinations the lead character is going through are surreal but so is what is supposedly reality. There are certainly deeper layers but the way the subject was approached and exhibited didn't leave me interested enough to think about it. This had a lot to do with the theatrical performances. The actions-reactions looked too staged. Ironically this works in Bipasha Basu's favor. She looks gorgeous and plays the enigmatic dream-girl really well. The grainy look and feel - maybe intentional, maybe budget-induced, maybe both - also works towards unnerving the audience. ]"
738,"[Most of the sports-themed films I've seen have been based on a sport that I've enjoyed watching, at least a bit. I always wondered how differently the film would appeal to a person who is not interested in the sport, or doesn't know the rules. Today, I was a part of that audience. It is difficult to say if I didn't enjoy the film because I don't like the sport one bit or it was a not-so well made film. My problem with boxing - any kind - is not only that it is a brutal game but also it seemed like the wrong one to pick for a theme of peace. I know, it can be argued that the irony was the whole point of the film. But, that didn't go down well with me, at all. I can imagine why the film was banned in Pakistan. I'm sure we'd have a furor here if we as a country were shown as evil, manipulative and cheaters. And to top it off, if that same film had all Pakistanis doing the right thing at the right time. Also, how much sense does it make to show individuals from each country hating the other while the government is using its machinery to end the war. Maybe it's closer to truth. Scary but I still don't see how this helps the process of peace. The film in itself has a very standard story. You win some, you lose some. You drive home a point. I actually liked the way in which the conflict was resolved, as a concept. But, the way in which it was done, the bulk character transformations just were too much to gulp down. As a far-fetched possibility, the character conversions would have worked had the actors done a half-way decent job with their acting. Interestingly, Aanahad was good with the growling during his boxing games as compared to the stone-face and body he carried even when he was supposedly being playful. Some of the most awful dialogue delivery possible. And what can be done when the only inspiration around seems to be Nafisa Ali. Sushant Singh, Farookh Shaikh and Saurabh Shukla are good in their support roles but can't make up for the expressionless cast around. So, the theme didn't appeal to me, the performances had nothing to hold my interest. The only thing that worked for me was the camerawork. It really accentuated the well-choreographed action sequences. How true they were to the game, I wouldn't be able to tell.A slow narrative of how a family hurt by a person from another country deals with the situation. It uses the usual means, no new moves. And I don't see why that should engage, educate, entertain?]"
739,"[Like many themes converted to films, mechanical corporate sharks wanting to take over a warm, cozy place associated with a lot of emotions, is not new. But Tum Milo Toh Sahi makes a genuine effort to make it meaningful. The emotions are not superficial, you identify with the characters. And yet you are not rooting for the protagonists and neither do you want to take the ""wrong-doers"" to court.Tum Milo To Sahi is a little bit about a lot of things. The most obvious one is a comment on disregard to saving the country's heritage by both its government and citizens. The ""metropolitan corrupting small-town simple-mindedness"" take is hard to miss too. Then you have ambitious characters being judged as greedy and insensitive under the mask of westernization. Society's lack of sympathy towards an unmarried mother is frowned upon too. So much to say, so little time. And thus, everything is said in a rush and the audience can't engage in anything at all. You watch with interest but no involvement. And there are a few things to hold your interest in place almost till the end. Dimple Kapadia and Nana Patekar's acts are completely spell-binding. Dimple Kapadia, in fact, reminded me of her character in Saagar. Buoyant and sensitive, loud and thoughtful, street-smart and direct. Nana Patekar does his usual frustrated common man deal, and does it well. The rest of the actors though are completely out of the veterans' league, though. Especially the kid who over-acts notwithstanding his over-done Australian accent. I enjoyed the set-up in the beginning too. The camera-work and way of introducing characters was different and pleasant. Usually I get annoyed in a film with hardly any long shots. But, this one it didn't disturb me. Though I think I'd have grasped the characters better if I was shown their environment every once in a while. The story is also played out and connected between the numerous characters pretty well. Despite the predictability, the piecing together of the different sub-plots is fun to watch. But alas, all goes phut in the last 20 minutes. All logical reactions given their characters go for a complete toss losing head and tail. Characters transform like they attained nirvana overnight. And soon enough a nice film becomes eye-roll material. The lines are fun but only sporadically. The preachy ones are more than what one wants to hear for entertainment or education. However, the lyrics of the title song are a pleasant surprise, especially considering the other mediocre writing in the film. A comment on the vacant space in relationships and general human disconnect with each other is insightful. It's disheartening that the last 20 minutes can undo the work of the first 110 so badly. This one will make a decent-enough watch when the DVD is out or when it has a TV release. Till then, IPL??]"
740,"[Anyone who has spent even a little time in trying to get any work done from a corrupt, bureaucratic government will relate with the film. The issue at hand here might be more serious and even larger, but it's easy to identify with the protagonists, Armaan Ali (Boman Irani) and Muskaan (Minissha Lamba). A standard beginning that sets the tone for the narrative; a slow and frustrating build-up - as if we should feel the characters' emotions; an interesting twist post-interval; a few irrelevant sub-plots; and an out-of-place climax make the film just about watchable.The only reason to watch the film would be to take a peek into the exasperating process of getting any administrative work done that involves government approvals and the trick used to show the system the mirror. The funniest bit is that, like one would expect, the the bureaucrats' and politicians' completely see through the point. Master stroke in the sotry-writing department. The most fascinating element for me in the film was the Andhra accent in which Hindi is spoken. It completely highlights the rural setting too. Having spent a lot of my summer vacations in that region, the language brought along its share of nostalgia and thus fondness. That doesn't make the language or dialect consistent, but it is used well in large parts. The dialogues are plain-speak and yet not the boring types. They keep you engaged through. The other department that makes this film worth its while is the performances. Minissha Lamba is simply brilliant as the strong-headed village girl. Both, her language and her looks are completely in tune with her character. Boman Irani too is completely convincing, but we wouldn't have suspected that anyway, right? The put-offs though were the various side-plots. The milieu here is very similar to that in Welcome to Sajjanpur by the same director. But the not-so-main stories in that one were extremely engaging. Here they are extremely annoying. Right from the Engineers lust for his wife, to the woman-trade, to the look-alike brother. They took away more than what they added to the ambience. These plots also lengthened the film by a lot more than what could have been a brilliant light film on a serious issue. Though they might have served the purpose of adding a few more smiles because I did hear a lot of laughter from the audience. I'd suggest a wait until the movie is out on TV/DVD just because it does call for the patient audience in you. The treatment given to the dry subject is refreshing and won't be a complete waste of time. ]"
741,"[You see on screen what you might read with your morning cup of coffee. Except that it's less fictitious and feels closer to reality than the paid-for articles offered by the mainstream media. (Unless of course, you rely on your twitter timeline for your daily dose of news.) Love Sex Aur Dhokha is cinema about how uncinematic life really is. Because in reality, love might not be as easy a cakewalk as narrated by YRF Films or as true either. A DDLJ-type love with due credit, a comment on our voyeuristic nature, and a sting operation make us introspect about the society we live in. Superficially, none of the three short films are exactly out of the ordinary. But there is something more than a story, director/writer Dibakar Banerjee is narrating. Yes, Rahul-Shruti's story is a spoof of happy cinema. And I had the same issued I had with it as I have with spoofy films that add nothing new but use the excuse of parody to do exactly what they are mocking at. Yeah, it also jeers at the how films are made in Bollywood - story being disregarded, etc. We've seen quite a bit of that. So, there's nothing new there. But it is also a comment on the Indian parent psyche - their priorities as guardians and a demonstration of their unconditional love. While all three stories are about our keen interest in other people's lives, Adarsh-Rashmi's story makes it loud and clear what the entire film is hinting at. Have we ever wondered how many ""bad things"" in the world would have not occurred if it were not for our boredom in our daily lives. For those of us who take pleasure in others' misfortunes, would do it only to make their lives less mundane, right? Why else would the life of a regular, not-so pretty-looking salesgirl at a dull general store interest us at all? Then there are issues that need to be exposed. Our media should be responsible for it. Some media groups take it upon themselves to reveal society's ugly face. But, how selfless are they? They bank on the same prying human nature to pick their stories. The theme of betrayal - from personal infidelity to how unfaithful media is with us - is repetitively emphasized by crossing, double-crossing, triple-crossing and more in the Prabhat-Nayna story. By the way, just one word for the entire cast - pure awesome! How can you comment on something that is made to look so regular, so ordinary that you think you can do it? Sure there is a connection between the stories in terms of characters crossing paths, but the connection seeps deep. No, the predictability of each story is not what I'm hinting at. Sure, none of the climaxes per se are shocking, but there is an all pervasive them of love, sex and dhokha (betrayal) running through the film. While one element might be over-powering than the rest in each one of them, the other two aspects are not far behind. Also common is the sort-of open-ended climaxes to all three stories. You know what actually happened, but the motivations of the characters is left to your interpretation. Interestingly, you can ask the same question of the entire superficial connection. Had the links in one story been picked up by characters from the other story, this one could have been not-so-dark.There is a fourth element in the film which is silent but you cannot shake it off - the camera. The camera is left around, almost as if its presence is pure coincidental, if not accidental. I can only imagine how much thought must have gone into making the camera-placement look so casual. That with the non-traditional lighting set a very dark tone to the film, which of course are justified by the nature of the stories. What is very traditional though, is the marketing technique deployed. The use of the word 'sex' to arouse curiosity and create an aura of sensuousness is nothing more than a publicity gimmick. Anyone going in expecting even soft-porn is going to be seriously disappointed. And Banerjee-saaheb, et tu? An item number with the closing credits? Yeah, yeah, yeah...spoof and all that jazz. Love Sex Aur Dhokha is not watchable just for you to decipher its comment on us as individuals or society. There are plenty that do that. It is not something you should go for just to see the ace-class production values. Nor is it just for seeing something different. It is one of those one-offs that are made worthy by the whole package. ""Why should such a film be made at all?"", the prude may ask. Why should any film be made at all? And the argument begins...]"
742,"[You are out for dinner with a few friends. One of them is a little upset because of something that happened during the day. He gets irritated by something the waiter does and bursts out in anger at him. The waiter had done something really petty, something wrong but not a big deal. What will you do? Join in with your friend? Defend the waiter because it was not really his mistake, but this means you are going against your friend. This is only a minor version of the dilemmas Right Yaaa Wrong presents. The story moves along interestingly and is thought-provoking. If only, it was a tighter and had better performances, it would be a must watch.I completely enjoyed how as an audience, I really didn't know whose side I was on. Both seemed right and both seemed wrong. Both evoked my sympathy, I wanted both to win. And all of this together kept me involved, engaged. Sure, I wasn't 100% involved 100% of the time. First one to blame there is the choice of slow-pace for a genre that needs to be chop-chop. The other one is the lousy performances. Each one of them is performing perfunctorily. The dialogue delivery is extremely amateurish. Especially the bits in which the police officers are bonding in the beginning. True, they are just setting the stage for bits and pieces to be used later. But the functional way in which relationships are put forward make them look manipulated and contrived together. So much so that the likes of Irrfan Khan and Konkona Sen Sharma can't cover-up for the others. These are huge minuses. So, the story had to take over that much more burden of making the film work. And it does. I enjoyed the back and forth and for me that was enough to make my trip to the theater worth it beyond this review. I enjoy court-room drama as much as I enjoy intelligent characters out-witting each other. They might not be the smartest turn of events but they had basic thought put in, which is conspicuous by their absence in many films of this day. Yeah, I'm surprised too. I actually liked a film titled as lamely as Right Yaaa Wrong (especially the extra aa) starring Sunny Deol. Dancing, fuming, and all. But, this is what even a decent attention to story can do to me. ]"
743,"[Somewhere in the first half of Nine, a journalist sarcastically tells film director Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis) that no one knew what his last film was about. As it turns out the sharp barb holds true for the film itself.At a very basic level, Nine is a musical about an Italian director Guido Contini who has 'run out of things to say'. Suffering from midlife crisis, Contini has not written a single word for his forthcoming film Italia for which he is about to start shooting in the next ten days. Through a series of songs and dances, we are introduced to the various women in his life and the depths of his frustration and are posed with the question of whether he will get over his block.The hitch is not so much the simplistic plot -- that is a given in most musicals -- but rather the lack of engaging music and energy that undoes it.Now Nine is a film that is adapted from an award-winning Broadway musical, which itself draws from Federico Fellini's film 81/2. I haven't watched the production or Fellini's movie. But I do have some idea of what an entertaining film could be. And Nine is not really that film.What Nine does however is it brings together some of the biggest Hollywood actresses across generations together. There is Sophia Loren who plays Contini's mother and appears in his imagination from time to time; Marion Cotillard who plays Luisa his wife; Judi Dench who is his costume designer and confidant; Fergie who plays a prostitute; Penelope Cruz who is his mistress; Kate Hudson an American fashion journalist and Nicole Kidman, his muse whose onscreen appearance may not be longer than nine minutes.Despite the presence of so many women or perhaps because of it, Nine tends to drift away in to particular direction. You know that these are the women who have touched Contini's life in some defining way but it doesn't necessarily come through.Dench of course belts out a fascinating performance -- she even has a song picturised on her -- as does Cotillard. But the performances of these women and that of Daniel Day-Lewis do little to save the faltering and predictable film. Nine comes from Rob Marshall who directed another musical, the immensely brilliant, Chicago. For some reason he is unable to repeat the magic in this one. Surely, Nine is no masterpiece and certainly not worth going bonkers about. If at all there are some breathtaking shots of Italy in the movie. But then again you could well find them on Google.]"
744,"[When I entered the movie hall to watch Alice in Wonderland, the entire row behind me had children presumably between the ages of 3 and 14. By the time I turned around during the interval most of them had left the auditorium and most of the others who were left behind were somewhat bored. It seems that the book I read as a child was made into a film that wasn't necessarily for children. Of course the book itself had far too many socio-political implications that I was to learn of much later in my life. But Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland unapologetically reflects the cold dystopia we live in. As a matter of fact it does so in an exaggerated fashion that leaves you somewhat out of sorts when you leave the theatre.Burton moves away quite a bit from the original plot of Lewis Caroll's classic tale. It follows a 19-year-old Alice who returns to the magical place (called Underland) only to be told that her true destiny is to kill Jabberwock a fierce creature and end the rein of the Red Queen.Tim Burton makes Alice out to be some sort of a champion on whose decision the fate of 'Underland' rests. Tired of being told what she should do, not wear and who she should marry Alice (Mia Wasikowska) follows the White Rabbit (voice of Michael Sheen) down the rabbit hole and finds herself in the company of Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas with a little help from animation guys), the Cheshire Cat (voice of Stephen Fry), the Dormouse (voice of Barbara Windsor) and the March Hare (voice of Paul Whitehouse) among others. Leading this insane menagerie of course is the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), who is convinced (unlike others) that Alice is the one who can save Underland from the tyranny of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and restore the throne to the rightful White Queen (Anne Hathaway).It seems to me however that Tim Burton's Alice is in more ways closer to Dorothy from Wizard of Oz than she is to Caroll's heroine. Burton's Alice tumbles into the rabbit hole from Victorian England just like Dorothy flew out of Kansas and landed in the wondrous Land of Oz. Both ladies have friends who help them out and vice versa. They also seek to restore a sense of order in the world they have landed in somewhat unknowingly and are somewhat changed persons when they return to their 'home'.Burton manages to create a stunning alternative reality that draws Alice as well as us into it. The painstakingly created Underland might be a far more dystopic world than we live in. But, it is perhaps the insanity that is endearing than the staid and 'unhappening' apolitical times of today.In all likelihood, Tim Burton will get an Oscar nomination as will Depp, who steps into the hat of Mad Hatter as if it was his own. Mia who plays Alice does an endearing job of it and emerges unscathed despite the presence of the talented and eclectic Johnny Depp.The tight screenplay ensures that you are on the edge of your seat from the first frame itself. And even though it does drift more towards the cliched side towards the end, it does hold your attention largely because of the implications of the scenes and the quick-witted dialogues.I could possibly go on about the symbolism in the movie (the most striking of it being the Red Queen and the White Queen obviously referring to communism and capitalism). But I won't take the fun away and rather you figure it out for yourself. I would however tell you that Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland made me stop and think. It brought about the realisation that the one thing most of us lose when as we grow up is, as Mad Hatter would say, our 'muchness'. It also reminded me that it was certainly good practice to believe in 'at least six impossible things before breakfast'. But most importantly it told me that the best way to travel is not by train or car but rather by a hat.]"
745,"[The title by itself has the power to touch any urban, nuclear family. And I wouldn't be surprised if joint families and not-so-few households in the smaller towns would be similarly affected by the title. (Now whether they acknowledge it or not is a different issue altogether.) O unannounced guest - most likely an Indian phenomenon - will thou depart in this lifetime? The humor in the title is sustained in the film. It's not laugh out loud comedy, it's not very subtle either. It keeps that smile more because your day-to-day life is echoing on screen. The writer tries real hard to balance between two generations; between a village simpleton and the smartened, outwardly-hardened suburbanite. One has its value system intact, the other needs a little bit of dusting to reach the embedded 'good guy'. As one can imagine, all the stereotypes are in place. But they manage to get through without stepping on too many toes, too hard. You can't point at any one event or sub-plot and say, ""hey, no one does that!"" And yet, it steps into slapstick-villa or preach-zone every once in a while. It makes you go cringe-cringe. And then there are times at which Ajay Devgn and Konkona Sen Sharma go over-the-top. And that makes you go cringe-cringe too. Sure, between those cringes are the smiles and the laughs. At the silliness, at the good jokes and at the repetitions that work. There are also songs which are parodies of old, popular songs. Much fun and entertainment they are. And then there is Paresh Rawal - the perfect annoying, intrusive, meddling house-guest! It is just fun watching him a clean, nice comedy. Yet there is so much missing! Atithi is also another attempt at a Hrishikesh Mukherjee/Basu Chatterjee type of a film. There is even a tribute to Hamari Bahu Alka. But Atithi gets nowhere close to that charm or the warmth that those films exude. But the sarcasm is hard to miss. And sarcasm ain't all fun. I mean parents today sure can't teach their kids Sanskrit shlokas just like the older generation can't teach polished English or higher level Mathematics. Anyway, shouldn't all that be done by the people who are trained to do that - the teachers?! Then, what's the point of that whole sub-plot. Why use it to belittle that the parents are doing? I could literally go on and on about this issue. These are stereotypes we learn to live with. We flare at them when we see them in films, and move on. SO. Yeah, Atithi is serious about what it wants to say, very serious. But tries its best to keep it light. Keep the laughs going. And it does do a decent job of it, too.]"
746,"[Road, Movie is another one of those few films that take a while to sink in. One in which most of the audience comes out laughing because they haven't a clue what just transpired in there. Yep, I didn't understand the film, its purpose, or the characters. But, it aroused enough curiosity. And make me think. Not necessarily about the issues raised by the film, but what the film was trying to say. Yeah, it is that kind of a film. In fact, if it were not for the absolutely spell-binding cinematography, I'd have suggested a wait till it's on TV/DVD. One needs to develop a palate for such films, and I'm still not one who can appreciate such narration completely. So what is all this absurd, bizarre talk about. The best way to tell you is as is. And there's hardly any worry of giving the movie away, because it is so open to interpretation. The stage is set with a truck carrying reels and reels of films and the mechanism to play it in an arid, rugged, barely inhabited desert. Water is more precious than oil. Oil is more abundant than water. And despite this basic need people have their aspirations and dreams. And well their dreams come true, in their dreams. Or something like that. :DAnd these dreams have been picturized beautifully. Of course, in an abstract way. It's difficult to explain and it's difficult to digest too. Not to mention that it's easily graspable in the first place. Ok, I don't mean to scare you. It's just that going in knowing that the film is about hope and accomplishment but has a dark and enigmatic tone, might help. Given all the ambiguity, I needed to care for someone, for at least one of the four characters. Ok, I wanted them to find water to quench their thirst, but so did I want the other women walking miles together in the desert sun to find water. I couldn't care more. The characters were pretty flat, except for Vishnu (Abhay Deol). But then Vishnu isn't a person you would care for. You could hate him, if you wanted to spend that kind of energy. I'd say that the Abhay Deol followers are the ones who will be keen to watch this film. Not for him per se, but more for his choice of films. And this one is less likely to disappoint that part of the audience. He doesn't have way too much to do. And the part he needs to play, as always, he uses his eyes and expressions more than his body language. Satish Kaushik does a fairly entertaining job, but then that's more because his character is sort-of the sweet adorable types. Mohammad Faisal Usmani, the 10-odd year old, had too much of a smart-Alec kind-of a character for me to get interested in how he's played it. The lines given to him are rather annoying. Tannishtha Chatterjee, has a lovely screen presence. I completely fell in love with the song her character sings in the loneliness of the night. Then there are those odd things that stick out. Nicely greased faces with only lips that are dry due to the heat. The background music is beautifl, just that it didn't feel like it went with the tone of the film, and thus stuck out. That too adds to the obscure atmosphere. Then there are people in the interiors having knowledge and presence of mind to use brands like ""starbucks"" in their daily language. And it's an intelligent film, so the line wasn't put in thoughtlessly. Does that mean the entire film is a dream of all the characters? phewRoad, Movie. An intentionally ambiguous film. A film very purposefully left open to interpretation. A deliberate attempt at making the audience yell, ""what the...?!"" The lyrics of the age-old song take on a new meaning while playing as the credits roll -Sar jo tera chakraayeYa dil dooba jaayeAaja pyaare paas hamaareKaahe ghabraaye, kaahe ghabraaye...Sun sun sun, are beta sunis champi mein bade bade gunLaakh dukhon ki ek dava haikyon na aazmaaye, kyon na aazmaaye(If your head is all muddledOr the heart is sinking lowCome to me darlingWorry you not, worry you not...Listen to me dear, hear me outThis greasy wonder is very virtuousA hundred thousand pains has one solutionWhy don't you try, why don't you try?)Seems like the makers are saying, if you don't understand, don't worry. Just watch films, enjoy them for what they are, it is the one solution to all your problems, no? ducking the brick ]"
747,"[I've a problem with films that so heavily bank on a particular theme but provide no technical background about it and do not make an attempt to weave it into the main plot. In this case, it's the game of ""Teen Patti"" (a reduced form of Poker, I believe). Replace the gambling background with any other field in which the protagonist is an expert and voila we have another film - Fixing of games in sports, organ trade...o-kay I'm getting crude, but you see what I mean. There is absolutely no attempt at showing us how the game or the system around it works. I'm not asking for a lesson, but I should know the writers are actually interested in their film's premise. Without those details, to me the master plan just looked like peeping into other people's cards and figuring out who has a better hand. Some genius. There is ample attempt at making it look and sound interesting, with rugged and glamorous sets as needed. And with psycho-babble about life, happiness and sundry. But that's all it remains a trial - which did not work. The only thing which worked is Amitabh Bachchan's acting, but then, when is the last time it didn't? And why would I want to watch a film for that when there are so many other options with the same feature. The rest of the cast including R. Madhavan who usually does a very good job of convincing us of his character, is shudder-inducing. Anyway, it's not like there are very well-written characters. And this, despite all of them being gray. None of them are outright villainous and they surely don't aspire to be heroic. They are each given a non-caricature-like distinguishing feature, but this isn't taken any further. No details, no nuances. They did know we are going to take objection to the woman being used only for her form and be treated as more or less brainless. Thankfully, the team of students who are making careers in gambling aren't shown as professional thugs who get it right from the word go. They try to maintain balance, with each of the team members going wrong in their plans and getting them all in trouble. But it soon becomes a pattern that you can easily see through. And the whole justification of carrying on one silly scheme after the other is pretty bonkers too. The basic, basic premise is taken from 21. Of course, the makers wanted to feel creative, so the protagonist and the sub-plots are changed around. Too little, in the early, the middle and the latter parts too. Only it gets more and more fragmented and ridiculous as it progresses towards the climax.There ain't no meat in the concept, the story, or the sub-plots. The only thing that keeps it going from being a complete write-off is Amitabh Bachchan's acting. Is that enough? This once, it doesn't look like it.]"
748,"[The good news is that the film doesn't suffer from the first half-second half syndrome. The bad news is that it follows a bell-curve. It starts out real bad, gets very interesting, peaks and ends not only in jiffy but rather sloppily. Fortunately, the film is sprinkled with dialogues that are witty and crisp. The set-up is ordered with an over-dose of everything - an extra aggressive landlord who asks for extra rent for an extra small place; an extra-ordinarily hostile work environment that immediately reminds you of Rocket singh; an exceptionally mild protagonist Karthik (Farhan Akhtar) who everyone throws around. O-kay, got the point. So low and down is Karthik's life that the only way it can go is up. By now despite all the exaggeration, you begin to care for him. You want him to slap all the people around him - real hard. And he does. 40 minutes of this 140 minuter are done with. This is when it gets interesting. Obviously, a thriller is a thriller if you can't tell why is the character going through this. But, I like the ones in which you can't tell despite it staring you in the face. Of course, anyone can guess 95% of what's happening, but the next 5% comes as a surprise. Unfortunately, though you should've gone through a ""aaaah, like that"" moment what you feel is ""blah!"" when the mystery unfolds. However, the romantic relationship between Karthik and Shonali (Deepika Padukone) is explored in quite some detail and is extremely engaging. It touches upon girls wanting nice and safe guys to misbehave. :) The contrast between the two characters is set-up nicely too. One avoids mobile phones because for him they were invented to plague his health. The other smokes. One enters the office along with the cleaners, the other around lunch-time. Despite this the romance is believable and done in a jiffy compared to the pace of the rest of the film.Farhan plays the simple man whose world revolves around his job and his love interest (no rhyming words for nokri aur chhokri in English) to perfection. In my mind, he's still a director, but you see this man act and want to see every project he's involved in. The best bit is when Karthik gets into the loop and falls into a self-fulfulling prophecy. What is confusing to the entire world is plain and clear to him. Deepika too does a good job of playing out the hesitation Shonali goes through before getting into a relationship And that bit is consistent in the writing too, but then there is nothing more left to explore in the character. Except, at times, she shifts gear as if she's talking to a child. Even the ""I love you""s!The film has an exaggerated tone of gray in the gloomy situations, which makes the use of ambience a bit too in the face. So is the use of the Rubik's cube. True it has been used as a motif and a metaphor for what's happening with Karthik. But these things are supposed to be left to interpretation not shoved down the audience's throat. Let's not even get to the hurried way in which the technical aspects of the subject are handled - in a rush hoping the audience won't notice.Like I said, I'd watch the film just for Farhan's performance. And don't forget the concept is more than half-interesting. It's just a bit too long and yet left unexplained.]"
749,"[There was a time not very long ago when American war movies were all about patriotism and sacrifice. The last few years however have contributed a lot in the changing of this perspective. The noughties began with the fall of the Twin Towers and ended with the Rrecession. Somewhere in between these two grand events Bush started his infamous Iraq campaign that would change the way the world viewed at war. The initial jingoism has now given way to weariness with movies now focusing more on the man in the bunker, as the reasons he was fighting for become more and more meaningless.The Hurt Locker is one such film, set in Iraq and telling the story of an elite bomb disposal squad. It is as much a story of the insecurities of the commandos as it is about the lack of choices for one man -- Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner), who smokes cigarettes and goes about disposing explosives like he's taking a walk in the park.James is good, heck he's brilliant -- in tune with the wires and the bombs he is about to defuse, at times even respectful to the person who has assembled the circuit. He is very sure of himself, at times so sure he doesn't care to wear his protective suit! But he is also very reckless, leaving Sanbourn (Anthony Mackie) the man in charge of watching his back, in a very unenvious position.So there you have, Sanbourn a complete contrast to James, working with him and trying his best to protect him and perhaps his own ulcer.But Hurt Locker isn't a film that dwells so much on the contrasts as much as it shows the monotony in the face of danger. Director Kathryn Bigelow manages to achieve this with her hand-held camera movements, lack of background score, some superb close-ups and a narrative style that puts you in the heat of things.The Hurt Locker in a sense is not a typical war movie. There aren't as many explosions you might have wanted and definitely not as many gunfights either. Instead there are portions in this movie when absolutely nothing happens. There is no music and there are very little visuals. At one point the screen goes entirely blank for a good few seconds. The beauty of this film lies in these moments. Bigelow manages to take you right into the scene of action and the slow pace only goes to show how killing anticipation can be. Having said that though, it also must be said that The Hurt Locker isn't a conventional entertainer that will make you walk out of the theatre and say a-ha! It gnaws on you, tests your patience to the point that you want Sanbourn and James to go home. I might also go to the extent of saying that perhaps you might also walk out of the theatre feeling somewhat disappointed because it doesn't fit into the parameters of a 'war movie'. But if you are patient enough and perhaps a little considerate. You might just understand what the sniper lying in one position all day waiting to shoot is going through.The director treads the line between action and suspense very well. You see things from the protagonist's mind and see just what makes him do what he does. Sure, James is the hero of the film. And for a lot of his colleagues he probably is a war hero? But does he consider himself to be one is a question that Bigelow attempts to answer. And she does a very good job at it.]"
750,"[""This is not how it happened!""  That was my friend's reaction to a certain scene that involved Hitler and a bunch of 'Basterds' sent out to kill the Dictator. Here's the thing about Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino's latest film to have hit the screens and bagged a handful of Oscar nominations: It is not a historical. It is also not a war movie.  It is a movie that refuses to fall into any category and is most certainly a piece of fiction that everyone would have wished had come true. Inglourious Basterds is not so much about Hitler or about the fictional Lt Aldo Raine (played here by Brad Pitt) as much as it is about Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), the fictional Nazi colonel who has a nasty reputation of sniffing out Jews from their hiding places. Raine is in fact just another player, a cog in the wheel so to say, who leads a pack of eight Jewish-American soldiers to get behind the enemy lines and kill as many German soldiers as possible. With a little luck, Raine and his band of 'Basterds' even hopes to bump off Hitler. But Hitler is a big man. And a big man has a lot of enemies. As it turns out, without the Basterds' knowing, the femme fatale Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) is also plotting to bring down the Third Reich -- not so much because she is anti-establishment but because she has some personal scores to settle with the Jew-hating Nazis. Plots and subplots merge beautifully to the extent that at one point Shosanna's story suddenly becomes all-important leaving behind the Basterds' plans. In fact the leader of the Basterds has very little to do. Brad Pitt plays what in Bollywood is referred to as 'an extended cameo'.  Sure he does a great job -- watch out for that scene where he speaks Italian -- but the truth is that the film, if it belongs to someone, it does to Christoph Waltz. Waltz is an Austrian actor, who according to Wikipedia has primarily done German language films. Interestingly he has played the philosopher Nitzche in one of his earlier works and in his next film he plays the psychologist Sigmund Freud. Thousands of bytes have been spent praising Waltz's performance as the Jew Hunter so it won't be a surprise if the man walks home with the Oscar for the Best Supporting Actor. The scene to watch out for is the opening scene of the film where Waltz walks into a French dairy certain that there are a bunch of Jews hiding right below his feet. The cold, calculated and casual conversation that Waltz has with the owner of the house before coolly gunning down everyone hiding below, except one, is a scene that will be remembered for the longest time. Yes, there is a lot of shooting, killing and bloodshed in Inglourious Basterds. But then again it is a Tarantino movie so what do you expect? The thing about IB is that it appeals to your basest instincts. One the one hand Landa's killings make your hair stand but also make you look at him with some amount of awe while on the other you cheer for Shosanna and Raine as they inhumanly go about their plans. But like all Tarantino's movies, this one too takes blood and gore to a different level, raising it (god help me for saying this) to a level of art. This is because Tarantino is a gifted artist. He loves movies and you can see it in every frame.  Tarantino pays tribute to popular English films through his background score as also to the expressionist movement playing on archetypes such as the Lady in Red. Inglourious Basterds is a brilliant movie. But chances are you will enjoy it more if you've been watching Hollywood movies over the decades. To draw a parallel -- Om Shanti Om will probably make you laugh even if you don't know what the hell Bollywood is all about. But if you know your Barjatya from Maoj Kumar OSO is a gem you will want to have in your collection. To twist Shrek's quote, Inglourious Basterds is like an onion... it's got layers.]"
751,"[Almost each one of us who was/is of the ""marriageable"" age has encountered at least one well-meaning distant relative who thinks we are the most eligible. The one who takes it upon themselves to find you the perfect life-partner. Well, To Baat Pakki is about one such lady, Rajeshwari (Tabu). No, she's not the eligible one, she's the dreaded relative. Her existence seems to revolve around finding the perfect groom for her little sister. There's lots of room for comedy, but only a tinee-winee bit is explored. The rating of course, clearly that there isn't much to look forward to in To Baat Pakki but the main character, Rajeshwari fascinated me. Of course, she is the standard, ultra-involved, annoying meddler. But, she is still the older sister. So, though it's never too obviously stated, you see a very heavy tinge of gray in her character. She wants for her sister what she could never get. She wants to live vicariously through her. Maybe, that's what most of those distant relatives mean to do using us, and that is exactly what makes them uber-irritating. And despite this interesting character, who you keep suspecting will turn the tables, the movie is pretty flat. The other characters barely arouse interest. And these were the exact characteristics of a Hrishikesh Mukherjee film. Common man, with common aspirations. A non-trivial social issue portrayed in a light manner. But somehow, everything in To Baat Pakki looks like a failed attempt. Except for a couple of the performances. Tabu must be one of the very few women who can pull of comic timing elegantly. She seems just perfect in the role. Interestingly, though age has taken its toll with the lady and she isn't half as engaging to look at as she used to be, this seems to have worked to the character's advantage. However, this is very little to carry the film through its entire length. It gets slapsticky in some parts, tardy in others. The light moments once in a while manage a half-smile out of you despite some decent performances. Other than that, the background music is extremely loud, irrelevant and thus distracting. The song and dance sequences follow the patterns of those followed in the 90s but with some decent camerawork to grab your attention. The songs themselves are...well, I don't remember. So, there you go.Toh Baat Pakki looks at an intriguing aspect of our social lives. But does it so flatly and yet with general ado, that it's more or less a painful watch. So, skip this one, there will be more Fridays and ensuing weekends that will have a movie worth the time.]"
752,"[Simran and Raj have grown up. They have crossed a few hurdles in the past 15 years, and now they face new ones. They are left to now deal with terrorism and racial divides. Director Karan Johar has grown up too and shows respect to his growing audience too. There isn't super-sappy emotional drama. There is no over-the-board filmy dialogue. There aren't frolic-y dances. All HUGE plusses. But, every once in a while melodrama takes a quick peek, and by the end it takes over. The lines aren't super-mushy but they are still belong to Utopia. And the background score takes over the gap left by the song and dance sequences. If I could give marks to improvement that a director, this movie deserves garlands, accolades, awards, and more. Surely, when something as sappy as ""We shall overcome"" gives me goose bumps, the director has done something very, very right. But, if a movie was only rated for the mistakes it didn't make, all credit would be taken away from films that don't have any intention of making them in the first place. And the argument could go round and round in circles. Well, then let's focus on what they did. I was wondering, if there was any need at all to bring in the ""autism"" angle at all? And I realized the film wouldn't be engaging at all if that wasn't a part of the whole schema. Shah Rukh Khan, would then be Shah Rukh Khan. And there is zero-tolerance for that. But, here his character, Rizwan, suffers from this syndrome which gives Shah Rukh completely different material to deal with. The permanent cock-eyed-ness, the no-eye-contact with any character for the entire length of the film, the restricted body movement - all keep you attached to Rizwan and far way from Shah Rukh. And kudos to the latter for that! :) No people, that was not the only purpose of making Rizwan suffer from Asperger's. Here's this person who had difficulty identifying emotions let alone expressing them. He just follows one guiding principle, ""That he is a good human being and will not let bad enter him."" Now, when a person with a low EQ knows that, how can we as a head and a heart allow bad things to happen in this world. Beautiful, ain't it? Unfortunately, anything with such high sentimental content has to give way to sappiness. Though, Karan Johar and his team of writers do manage to keep a huge chunk out for most of the film. The last 40 minutes complete lose all sanity. The moment you see a mother who has just lost her son change into whites while her child is lying still in the house, you know this film has very little hope, now on. Though, ironically, it's trying to say there is hope.Add to this drop, a super-shrill Kajol throughout the film. The lady's voice is high-pitched when she's excited/happy and piercingly so when she's upset/sad. Considering that, there are only two main characters whose personalities we are exposed to; it is actually heartbreaking to see zero chemistry between the two. Save a couple of ""moments"", there is no romance in this love story. However, you do see a lot of romance between the camera and its subjects. The arid deserts, the city sky-lines, and the general magnificence of the US is covered beautifully. The puller-downer is that it is almost like it was shot for their makemytrip.com advertisements.Given all of this, I might have urged all of you to wait for the DVD for the first two hours of the film and would have also equally vehemently urged you to skip the last 40 minutes or so. But given the ""illogical"" conditions revolving around the release of the film, I'd say - all those keen to support the entire team of My Name Is Khan should go watch it in the theaters. It is not a waste of money, time, energy and certainly not a waste of your courage. ]"
753,"[There are two story-lines. One involving a politician, his henchmen and agenda. The other is about one of the henchmen and his love wife. Thankfully, there is a connection between these two plots more than the common character. But, somehow, there is a disconnect. It has more to do with the screenplay forgetting one plot for a long duration when the other is on, thus making them obviously feel like two different stories. Yet, the curiosity of the weird, almost surreal events keep you engaged.The problem with the direction though is that the ambience tilts toward so much surrealism that you kind-of figure out what's going on. Even if it is not exactly what's going to happen, you know the general direction and are just waiting to watch your hunch come right. Fortunately, this is a bit different from outright predictability, because that usually ensues boredom. This does not. There is also an attempt to stick to the traditional tactics attached to the thriller genre. The music and the stylish use of light and camera angle. Unfortunately, it's only a good attempt. The punch is not to be heard or seen. Though I cannot put a finger on what exactly it is, there is something amiss as far as style is concerned making it look ""wannabe"". Then there are caricatured characters. The henchmen have a well-defined but weird trait. Like the guy who hasn't outgrown his nursery rhyme days and likes reciting them before a kill. This, I think is what we saw in The Usual Suspects. Except it doesn't add to the menace of the character, it makes him funny. Which means a lot is lacking in the acting department. Each actor looks like he/she is trying too hard, including the mystic character played by Sonali Kulkarni. And this attempt at being the caricatured character defined for them becomes extremely distracting. And yet, the twist in the tale is a decent one. Even a real good one, if you don't see it coming. Meanwhile, a theater trip can be saved for another thriller, another Friday. This one will be alright on TV too.]"
754,"[Hollywood has loved to make alien invasion movies. 2009 has been different. From the top of my hat I can recall at least a bunch of movies that have turned the tables on this concept. There is of course Avatar, then a funny animated flick called Planet 51 and then there's District 9.Interestingly all three belong to different genres and seem targeted at altogether different audiences. Planet 51 is meant for kids, for instance. Yet these three films have a common theme -- that who is alien and what is acceptable are very subjective and that alternative perspectives can change one's standpoints drastically. Avatar is about humans creating havoc in an alien landscape. Planet 51 is about an astronaut landing on an unknown planet and realising that he is the alien there and not vice versa. District 9 however is slightly different from these two. Here an alien spaceship descends upon earth and mysteriously malfunctions over the city of Johannesburg. It continues to stay there without any communications till the humans break into the ship and discover a city of malnutritioned alien beings. On humanitarian grounds, the earthlings give them refuge till they realise that they might've made the biggest mistake of their lives. Directed by debutante Neill Blomkamp, District 9 adopts a documentary style of filmmaking in its first half. In the second half however the camera doesn't move as violently even as the action does get pretty gruesome. The film itself owes its roots to Blomkamp's sci-fi short film in which a similar alien spaceship lands over Johannesburg. Needless to say because of the film's South African setting you can find a lot of references to the apartheid years. The theme of forced eviction is one such instance. The name of the movie itself refers to District 6 from where some 60,000 people were evicted in the 60s. District 9 is a stark tale of the xenophobic nature of human perspectives and the never-ending greed of private corporations that will go to any extent to make profits. The film also seems to give out a message that is loud and clear, a message that quite a few films of last year seem to be giving out -- that just because we are humans does not mean we are always in the right. Wikus' struggles are as heart-wrenching as they are eye-openers. The tight screenplay and the path-breaking direction only add to the pathos of his story. Of course, towards the end District 9 resorts to some cliches. Either way it makes for some great viewing and a must-have on DVD. ]"
755,"[Every once in a while comes an animated film that makes you smile and wonder at the simplicity of the world that we once lived in as children. Disney Pixar's Up is one such film. It tells the story of a widower Carl Fredricksen (voice of Jeremy Leary) and an eager beaver 'wilderness explorer' Russel (Jordan Nagai) who is dying to earn his batch for assisting the elderly.Harassed by real estate sharks and ordered by the court to go into a retirement home Fredricksen decides to take off... along with his house floating on helium balloons and keep a promise he made to his wife long ago. Little does he know that he isn't alone! The poor wilderness explorer is right outside on his porch and the two unlikely companions begin their adventurous journey. The storyline of Up, as innovative as it sounds, and does tend to flag towards the end. In fact the last 15-20 odd minutes of the film almost drag as you know just what is about to happen. This predictability is the film's most major flaw. For most part however, Up is the charming and lovely fairy tale that it is supposed to be. It is also at a very basic level a reminder of how one can get caught up in the everyday and the mundane only to forget the dreams one has been living for. Perhaps that is why the scene that you are most likely to love and associate with is the one where old Fredricksen hoists his house on helium balloons leaving behind a gloomy world that only runs behind materialistic possessions and lives in concrete jungles. Unsurprisingly the only friend the widower finds is a ten-something-year-old Russell, untouched by malice, hatred and greed. This is a theme that could've taken the film to a new level. However some tacky portions in the screenplay and very poor storytelling ruins the fun. These are also parts that resort to cliches and are portions that make you want to walk out of the movie hall. However if you forgive directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson for these parts, Up is a very, very fine film indeed. Is it better than Wall.E? If you have liked the animated robot flick the year before last chances are you will like this one just as much if not better. It is a film that you must take your kids to and more importantly watch it yourself. If nothing else, it might just make you chase the dream you've been putting away for another day.]"
756,"[Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) loves his work. He travels all over the United States doing the dirty job of firing people for bosses who'd rather not face their employees on the D-day. Bingham lives out of a suitcase, engages in one-night stands, is on the road for over 250 days a year and refuses to get into any committed relationship. Life for the 40-something Bigham is about to change when two women (Natalie Keener and Alex) walk into his life, making question Bingham everything he has done and loved all along. Up In The Air has been nominated for six Academy awards including Best Picture, Best Director (for Jason Reitman) and Best Actor (for George Clooney). The film is based on the book by the same name and takes some liberties with the original plot. At its heart, the story of the book and the film remain the same -- they are both about a man living in the sanitised world of airports and hotel rooms. Up In The Air released in the US at a time when the country's economy was down in the dumps. Perhaps it's one of the reasons why this movie has garnered much critical acclaim. By taking up the sensitive theme of lay-offs, Up In The Air touches upon the cold nature of American capitalism. It also takes a look at a man who derives his sense of being from car rental cards, hotel keys and whose only aim in life is to touch 10 million frequent flyer miles. The mood of the film is quite like one of Clooney's earlier films -- Michael Clayton. Only unlike Clayton, Bingham is no revolutionary. He is an ordinary man who is more than happy to tow the line and make some money in the bargain. What is it that makes him a hero then is what Up In The Air is all about. Over the years, George Clooney has experimented with varied roles -- his last film was a comedy called The Men who Stare at Goats -- and has shown that there is more to him than the Batman days of yore. But Clooney's performances as a down and out man-next-door are the ones that are perhaps most convincing; Michael Clayton is a classic case in point. From the man who is seemingly in control of his life to a person who begins to question himself, George Clooney plays the role of Ryan Bingham more convincingly than anyone else you can imagine. Needless to say he holds the film together. The two women, Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick -- who have also earned nominations -- manage to hold their own too. Kendric who plays Clooney's young coworker and an upstart out to change the world delivers a great performance.While Farminga has little to do, she is the one that provides the film and Clooney's character a much-needed turning point. The hitch however is that the chain of events is somewhat predictable. This is a big downer though over all, Up In The Air is a movie you won't mind owning on DVD and the keener ones could do by going to the cinema halls when it releases in India. ]"
757,"[The Blind Side is a real-life drama about Michael Oher, a football player and his struggles from being an abandoned kid growing up in foster homes to an NFL player. Starring Quinton Aaron as Oher and Sanra Bullock as his adoptive mother, the film has been nominated for Oscars in the Best Actress and the Best Film category.What makes The Blind Side such a compelling movie is the fact that it tells a true-life story of a boy with little or no prospects. The Blind Side however, is not just another underdog movie. It is a film about human relationships, the need to reach out to the ones less fortunate, but most importantly, it's a film about believing in oneself and following one's convictions even when the whole world might be booing you. The fact that the film is a real-life story makes it an even more compelling narrative. During its two-hour run, the screenplay of The Blind Side shows no signs of flagging; nor does it get into unnecessary details even when there are at least a quarter dozen stories that are dying to be told. Instead, writer-director John Lee Hancock chooses to focus on one and one story only -- that of Michael Oher. Everyone else's personal tales fade out in comparison. Sandra Bullock who plays Leigh Anne Tuohy surely does a great job. But if there is someone who the Academy has left out it is Quinton Aaron, the six-feet something huge actor who has played the role of the underdog with such conviction your heart goes out to him. In the first part of the movie you see him with just a polythene bag -- the kinds you use for buying fish -- and set of clothes on his back spending nights at the Laundromat or the gym simply 'because it's warm in there'. Believe me there is nothing more heart-wrenching than those scenes. Last year the Academy took note of a somewhat unknown actor Richard Jenkins and his role in a little-known film called The Visitor and nominated him in the Best Actor category alongside Sean Penn and Brad Pitt. Looking at this year's nomination list you wonder why Aaron never made it to any of the categories. We all know what a wonderful actress Sandra Bullock is -- she's given us very many memorable films over the years. But if you must watch The Blind Side, watch it for the performance of Quinton Aaron.]"
758,"[Avatar is a movie about love, hope and the fight for survival. It is also a dark reminiscent of the colonial times as also an ugly reflection of the times today when nature and human life are sacrificed in the face of economic development and financial profits.It is 2154 and a huge multi-planetary corporation is hoping to hit the jackpot by hunting for a rare mineral called unobtanium on Pandora, an earth-like moon of a planet in outer space. In the process, they threaten the very existence of the locals, the Na'vi a humanoid species that inhabits the unobtanium-rich area. While the story itself has nothing new to offer, Cameron's conceptualisation, vision and direction makes all the difference. Simply by turning the tables on alien movies Cameron makes a social statement about everything from capitalism to deforestation. The director chooses to work with relatively unknown actors -- a popular trend in Hollywood that has thrown up a completely new generation of superstars in the last decade -- and narrates the tale with conviction and a passion that very few directors can claim to boast of. Indeed, it is his vision and perception that towers way over the actors' performances but gives you your money's worth. Despite being almost three hours in duration, Avatar hardly feels as long as it is. A tight screenplay saves the day as to the immensely brilliant computer generated effects. The concept of Avatar was written way back in 1994. However Cameron insisted that the technology required for executing his vision was not present then. He has waited for over a decade and a half for the scientific know-how to catch up with his imagination. Eleven years after Titanic hit the screens and swept the Oscars, Cameron returns with yet another grand project touted to recreate history. Boy it has most certainly been worth the wait. ]"
759,"[Rugged and raw - the slums of Mumbai are on display. There's also foreplay with time taking us back and forth and back. It's slick. And the drama escalates to invite curiosity. All good. Then, why the disarray? Because you wait and wait for something to happen and it doesn't. Or it happens, but is so sudden that it seems completely out of place. Maybe that's the reality that the filmmakers talk about. Or maybe that's how drama was supposed to build. But, here it doesn't.With a tagline that translates to ""the fittest survives"" you are constantly waiting for the film to peak. And the way the film is lit, shot, and edited, it holds promise. If the technicalities are good, there's hope that the story will catch up, right? Well, instead three and a half, different, promising threads take you nowhere. From the name and the publicity you look forward to a good board of carrom. While, you are thankful that there are no last-minute comebacks, there is nothing for you to root for or pray against. There aren't even good ricochet shots. And at the end of it you realize that the carrom in the film could have been easily replaced by any other skill Surya, (Siddharth), the protagonist has. Oh and that expected metaphor of life / system / protagonist being the striker is bleh, to say the least. You then look forward to the communal disharmony and the ""different"" angle that this particular story seems to have the potential for. Another hope brutally stoned to death. It's a mere backdrop not connected to the other limbs of the story. You can seek condolence in the fact that you realize this only towards the end, so the going is still alright. Also, meanwhile you see this lovely friendship between Surya and his bum-chum, Zaid (Ankur Vikal) germinating. Both in their own way, aspiring to do better for themselves. One taking everything seriously; the other relentlessly smiling through life. One taking as a straight a road as circumstantially possible; the other not-so-straight. One losing spirit; the other never willing to say die. One courageous enough to openly fight the biggest goon around; the other doing the same except by cheating the goon. Both actors play their characters mere functionally. And so does Anupam Kher, who's character, Inspector Farooq enters and exits the frame as per convenience only to represent the neutered law enforcement system. Even while he tells you that the most honest of police officers have to walk on a smalltime goon's corpse to get to the bigger fish, his role is very choppy and extremely disconnected. In this whole affair, the only actor who creates any kind of an impact is Aditya Pancholi as Jaleel. A whole lot of credit goes to his make-up artiste though. As the proceedings go on Surya's voiceover tries to create a link in these disjointed bits but works only as much as a voiceover can. Sure, this one worked for me only partially, but that the parts that worked is a sign of hope from this team because they have a skill set in the technical department as a starting point. Also, I feel the story-telling is not that much of an issue as the story itself. Well, there's always a next time. ]"
760,"[It's lengthy, it's slow and it's preachy. And yet it's engaging. It's not that you don't lose your patience every once in a while, but there's enough to savor on the screen. And if not that, soon enough, an interesting remark is made or story moves a bit forward in the right direction. A Muslim protagonist, a common man, an auto-garage owner, a part of the local community association - Hasmat bhai (Paresh Rawal) finds himself struggling what he has always believed his religion was and what he's being told his religion is. He believes in work as his religion, keeping to his commitments as his highest priority - qualities long lost in contemporary India. After much internal debate he follows his conscience. If it were not for the thoughtfulness and the sincerity with which the thought is put up that marks the film above average and a must watch, if not in the theater, at least on DVD. Even if the topic doesn't interest you, you might want to catch Road to Sangam just to experience the freshness in Paresh Rawal's ultra-serious performance. A non-caricature, non over-the-top role by him is a gem that can be non-rare but isn't. Unfortunately that can't be said about, some of the other performances. While Om Puri looks rather stiff, the Maulana twitching his beard and talking in a weird tone and pitch was rather amusing. Also, all the talent that went into writing Hasmat's character was absolutely missing in other characterizations. They were rather feeble and except for a one-odd case transformed without much convincing. In fact, Om Puri's character just disappears at a crucial point in the film and reappears as per writer's convenience. And yet the concept itself is powerful enough to let go of these glaring loopholes. The entire 2.5 hours length of Road to Sangam plays out as an intelligent drawing room argument. The pace that follows the life-style in any non-metro gives you time to mull. Mull over issues like the partition of India and Pakistan  was actually a partition of the Muslims. It toys around with what-ifs with remarks like the savings on defense expenditure had the partition been avoided. That done, what is the need of the hour today? Another Gandhi as you see Hasmat reincarnated as Bapu himself, as the latter's ashes pour into the holy waters. And Hasmat is just the common man like you and me - it is you and I who need to go on a satyagrah for our fellow-citizens to see what we really need - peace.Road to Sangam does that for one community. What about fundamenatalists from other religion(s)?]"
761,"[Utopia exports a TV channel to Delhi. But of course, the earthlings contaminate the empire. And we are then taken into the world of the mean media industry. If the spate of films in the ""expose"" genre are anything to go by, we, the audience, either know everything that needs to be known or being fooled to believe that that's all there is to these industries. Rann is another such example. Had it not been for a couple of the performances and a couple of points where the story could take an interesting turn, the film would have completely collapsed. Also, had the 'background music files' and 'camera angle schedule' of Rann not been exchanged with director Ram Gopal Verma's horror film, Phoonk, Rann would have been immensely watchable and hearable. (Can't even give you the virtual ""eye-roll"" cause my eyes hurt.) And yet the two pillars that the film stands on are enough to make it an interesting watch. Amitabh Bachchan as the composed, honest, serious, intelligent TV channel owner, Vijay Malik, makes you want to look out for him. And it hurts to see his head hang in shame. What a brilliant actor! It is so refreshing to see Riteish Deshmukh as the serious, almost mute Purab, a rookie journalist soaking in how the business-politics-media nexus works. More power to the makers of this casting decision. Next in line, Sudeep as Jai Vijay Malik, did well in his first five minutes of screen time, after which his role didn't demand anything new. Paresh Rawal in yet another caricature role makes the evil grin as tolerable as it can be. What hurt is the roles shelled out to the women. Especially, Gul Panag. What was the point of doing a role which made no contribution except shrieking like any third Hindi film actress? Neetu Chandra's character was so annoying that it's amazing the boyfriend she's nagging didn't murder her in the middle of the film. Can't blame any of them for bad writing, but certainly raised a question or two about script decisions by the ladies. However, Suchitra Krishnamurty's role was a bit meatier but at the end of it all she's only another man's pawn. (Her character reminded me a lot of Rakhee's character, Geeta in Trishul)Interestingly, it's not that RGV was making a masala flick. Then why such shoddy writing for the women. As  is, the overpowering existence of one-dimensional characters (other than the music and camera) is a hurdle to let the film take you over. Yet, while you don't expect any better from the black sheep, the dilemma and emotions that a couple of the white sheep go through are extremely engaging. And ultimately if you as an audience are happy when the white one does the ""right thing"" the writer/director/both have gotten something right. That is over and above the performance. There are points in the film that a question lingers, ""what will this character do?"" ""How will he crack this one?"" Only unfortunately, he takes the most obvious path and you laugh at yourself for letting your brain work in top gear. You set your thoughts aside, another story - another day. Meanwhile, the dialogue is crisp and topical. While I could have easily done without the over-preachy middle portion of one of the channel head's speech, the beginning and the end were well written and beautifully performed. And then comes a shoddy climax that shakes you out of your reverie. Oh well. So, nothing new. Same old brigade against still camera by cinematographer Amit Roy. Same old spooky score in the background. Same old trying to tell a story of the insides of an industry and telling us what we already know. And still wondering why the characters were struck by shock. I hope there are people who like Rann more than I did, and there is a radical movement of sorts that will make the media more responsible. BUT, in case that doesn't happen there's still, some masterwork in the acting department and a partially interesting thread of plot, to make the film worth your time. ]"
762,"[I feel like this unappeasable audience who demands more and more from her movie-makers. I constantly complain about one-dimensional characters. Ishqiya has three reasonably well-defined characters with very visible shades of gray and yet it doesn't give a ""complete"" feeling when walking out of the theater. The film is made well technically too. The interaction amongst the characters takes a hit in this one, and it is difficult to understand the motivations of their behavior.After an intriguing start, mid-way, the film completely changes its tone. This leaves you disconcerted. Sure, a lot about the characters is intentionally mysterious, but as we approach the climax, shouldn't there be at least a vaguely interpretable rationale. It doesn't even have the artsy, take-your-own-guess kind-of an appeal. It looks more like lazy writing. Khaalu-jaan (Naseeruddin Shah) is a romantic who can kill, if he wants to. Babban (Arshad Warsi) is a thug who falls in love. Both are rugged, men of the soil. Krishna (Vidya Balan) is a romantic who maintains a constant enigma about her. She's absolutely convincing as a seductress who knows what she wants (whether or not we figure it out). Once the chemistry between them is established it is awesome and the actors have done a wonderful job. But, why the chemistry happens in the first place, has no answers. Also, a lot of this is because you don't have any background about the setting of the film. It is either assumed that you know what happens socially and politically, in and around Gorakhpur or you are given a feeling that it is not supposed to matter. Since I don't know why the Yadavs are fighting the Thakurs, there was a huge gap in the dynamics of the various side characters. And yet there is a lot going on by means of entertainment and keeping you interested. The spontaneous dialogues delivered with perfect timing. The twisted plot is engaging - so what if it geared towards a lame and dissatisfying end. Also, the propriety and plausibility of Krishna's behavior are a huge question mark. ""Executing a nice story well,"" is not an easy feat. With a unmissable Vishal Bharadwaj feel to the way the story is told, it is lyrical and earthy. But the story is kind-of warped and leaves a distinct taste of discontent. p.s. I wish a movie could be given a higher rating for awesome music. All songs, except for 'Ibn-e-batuta' are exceptional - brilliant music and lyrics to top that.]"
763,"[Ancestral feud. Mutual hatred. Boy meets girl. And if that ain't enough, you have rom-com, song-dance sequences and comic relief. Those, as we all know, are the ingredients of the masala cocktail. They seem to be in almost the right proportion too. How much each element is allowed to marinate is where things go wrong. So, while it's a go right ahead for ""Salmaniacs"", for others it's not a complete loss either.That could be because some masalaparameters are kept void, like a love triangle, a spy in the tribe, etc. But, if we really wanted to get into what could have been, there is a lot more that could've been straightened out for it to make a better mark with the audiences. For example, the comic element in the romantic thread distracted from the story big time. The sincerity of the lovers didn't reach us mainly due to the laughs the makers seek to generate. Then, there's the almost 3-hour length and the pace at which every elements of the story unfolds. While the introduction to various Rajahs and Sardars and their black, white and guess what...some gray characters takes up the first half, it isn't boring. For one the way the camera moves, pans and zooms, make you marvel at the terrain. Then the songs, especially Taali, is composed, sung, picturized (in a smallish tribal den), and choreographed to draw and keep your attention. At this point you are wondering about the story that is still waiting to be told and you see potential too. Welcome the second half. While the good things of the first half are nowhere to be seen, the plot leads you to some extremely involving conflicts and dilemmas. The politics between the British, the Rajputs and the commoners is intriguing. So, you don't really miss the enjoyable music, because there's something that keeps you hooked. Unfortunately, the pace at which it needs to be told now (in the hour that's left) is a challenge. And everything has to be resolved in a hurry, leaving way too many important questions unanswered. And it ends in the most disappointing fashion ever! At the end, it is like almost every Salman-starrer. More about him, the actor, than about his character. He plays the cool-dude only wearing Pindhari outfits (I've serious doubts any of the costumes were researched or authentic). His dad played by Mithun does his bit of being happy, full of valor and emotional in turns. The beautiful-but-plaster-of-Paris look of debutant Zarine Khan is interesting only because of the meat her character could potentially hold. Yes, a woman in an epic drama actually had a valuable role, but in the end it all collapses into the humdrum. How I wish, her actions were explained a little better and she was shown to have a brain of her own. Her dilemma between love and duty was worthy of some more detail. Because my time in the theater was spent smiling and waiting for interesting things to happen, it kept me interested. But once out, when I think about each element in the story that caught my fancy, I realized it wasn't developed further. They didn't take it to a conclusion, logical or otherwise. I'd still not trash it; it's a fair attempt to entertain, and manages to do that intermittently.]"
764,"[The world of an aspiring actor (Shahid Kapoor) in big bad Bollywood. His tiny failures making him into a big-time LOSER, his mini-successes adding up to nothing substantial. You heard it over and over again. You've watched it at least 4 times a year. But you are hopeful that it will still be told in a way you'd enjoy; that this sorry guy will appeal to you; that you'll feel bad for him. But the makers of Chance Pe Dance don't care enough to get you involved, so there's nothing much you can give them other than maybe some eye-rolls. Just when Shahid Kapoor was beginning to grow on me as an actor he completely irritated me. The faces he pulls, the way he carries himself are only annoying. Genelia D'souza is her regular chirpy-bubbly self and I wonder when we'll know if she can do anything else. Sure, she has her occasional emotional moment here, but nothing to remember her by. Can I really blame her? With such a regressive role written for her, there is only so much a girl can be expected to do. Tina, the budding choreographer she plays, is supposedly good at her job. She begins to like a guy and her life as her own ends? Why? Or maybe they are trying to comment on the undying love that a woman is capable of. Though the way the story is narrated, I doubt the writers had any such lofty aims. Laziness, they had loads of. Okay, lets' assume for a while that detailed characters was not something the writers had on mind. They wanted to create a story about opportunities and how you take them can make or break you. But, unfortunately, the lines in the film are as lame as that last line I just wrote. And the events in the film are so functional and episodic. They don't flow into each other. They just come and go as is convenient. Now, if the characters are going to behave like you'd expect them to, and if they are going to spout lines, ad verbatim what's playing in your mind, the story is bound to be predictable. There's no attempt to deviate from the norm. What's left than is the backdrop of the film. Both Sameer and Tina are supposed to be awesome dancers. What I know after watching this film is that Genelia and Shahid are awesome with aerobics. Dancing? Maybe we'll have to wait for another day, another film. For now, let's just say the entire team got all the moves wrong. ]"
765,"[An average looking person barely gets half a glance from the opposite gender. The good-looking people don't necessarily like the diva status accorded to them. They are only human, and would like to be approached by genuine admirers. These are two extremely valid points that keep the geek and the beauty away. And Pyaar Impossible actually dwells into them pretty deeply. Only unfortunately, they use the tackiest lines possible. So much that even a girl would want to avoid this thorough chick-flick.Fine, you could give the writer credit for trying to have an actual story revolving around the core love story to give the film a little depth. But, except for Alisha (Priyanka Chopra) the other characters hardly had any depth. Abhay (Uday Chopra) and Siddu (Dino Morea) are as white and black as they could be. And it's not like they evoke any emotion in you as a one-dimensional character has potential to do.  It's this monochromatic view of the world, be it Abhay's father (Anupam Kher) or the supposedly 6-year old girl, Tania (who's not credited on the official site), that makes everything very flat, only that it's exaggeratedly flat. Abhay is too nice, his father too patronizing. Siddu is too mean. Sure, there might be people in the real world who are all sweetness or all manipulative. But they are no fun to watch on big screen, especially when they have nothing smart or engaging to say. Oh yeah, the Tania, the 6-year old granny is either extremely annoying or extremely mature. Sorry, that doesn't count as a shade of gray. For me, the deal was shut in the first few scenes when Uday Chopra's voiceover is 'trying' to be funny. Ok, they might have tried to prove that geeks have a lousy sense of humor, but a film is not supposed to make my eyes roll! And certainly not make me control my yawn or give out a mock-snore because the dialogues are so cliche and preachy. Somehow, I don't see much choice left to the actors in such a situation. They have to exaggerate their sugariness and bitterness and thus come across as caricatures. It's painful that what could have been a refreshing course on love 101 and in good detail, becomes a discourse you would want to avoid. Despite the good-looking people playing their role to perfection. Oh well...maybe next time Yash Raj Films, you'll be able to avoid cliches that you created.]"
766,"[It is so simple to be good in Hirani-land. You beg, borrow or steal with good faith to be a lovable, charming person in the land of idiots. And how much ever I hate the use of fiction in a realistic set-up, I end up enjoying each of his worlds. Maybe because, like most people, I want to believe that it is possible to be good in this mean-mean world. Also it's nice to see a comment on the educational system and the Indian-parent psyche, both competing to kill invention and creativity. In fact, this time around, it felt like Rajkumar Hirani has taken it upon himself to challenge every single complaint that I have against typical Hindi masala films. I hate slapstick. He uses it - it's justified after all (the setting is a boy-dominated college and an all-boy hostel.) And DAMN! He makes me laugh at Mr. Bean-Tom &amp; Jerrystyle jokes. And out loud at toilet and sex-related jokes! :( He uses that sttuppid marriage-melodrama scene. Yet, I'm egging the bride on to run away, completely disregarding the little change in plan-of-action that Hirani employs. As in typical slaptick comedies the actors ping-pong between loud and melodramatic. You can call that brilliant acting, or say you cannot judge the actor because he is doing what the genre demands - take your pick. Then there's that slapsticky, loud background music too. And the list goes on. I want to hate this man's guts, but can't help admire the way the typical toilet-humor so fluidly mixes with the insight that comes next. Though I fear he's taking the slapstick a little further with each of his ventures. A little further towards making the content appeal to the palate of the ""masses"". Be it the overuse of songs or cliches which are smartly covered under the guise of spoofs. Using a 40 year old actor to play a 17 year old. It is mildly irritating this time, the next time the annoyance might increase.But that doesn't mean he hasn't taken any risks. The lead lady Pia (Kareen Kapoor) makes her first appearance on screen only in the 45th minute of the film. The kind of humor he uses itself is risky. Such serious, sensitive, and real issues are laughed at whole-heartedly - by the characters. Such dark humor! And well, the audience too was laughing, but that doesn't reduce the risk taken, right? This might be the most obvious statement that one can make about the film, but how can you not say it when you have seen it. This film would have been hollow without its dialogues and their delivery. And despite the occasional shallow humor. And even if a few of them are sms/e-mail forwards. Its what they lead up to that's more engaging. All fingers point back to the man, Rajkumar Hirani, who has written the dialogues and directed their delivery. While some of the phrases coined will become references in everyday conversations, the mantra ""Aal izz well"" has been taken to the extreme in the film's writing. The screenplay makes sure the audience knows from the beginning that ""aall izz well"" in the end. So, yeah, you can call it predictable. And some of the events are predictable because the screenplay has given that one extra second for you to think and guess what's going to happen next. But those are semantics. The point raised or answered after that predictable moment is not something you'd think of - at least not all the time. Another huge element of writing - characterization - is mostly done by use of caricatures. From Chatur/Silencer to Prof. Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani); from his supposedly-soon-to-be son-in-law to even Rancho (Aamir Khan), they all look like they are out of a comic book. But then you have seen a character like that in your circle of friends - the one who names the price/brand of an object before you ask for it, the one who is competitive ad nauseum, the one who spouts philosophy every third second. But that lingering element of masala is not to be missed. There are no gray characters. Rancho, for example, has huge strokes of Raghu from Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Bawarchi. But there was still something mysterious about Raghu, something that made you curious about him. But here, you know Rancho could do no evil even if he wanted to.And yet Rancho makes you laugh, he jerks your tears. One or the other emotion is at a high, all the time. But, the question I have about all films that give a ""message"" in a lighter vein - will the laughs stick or the message? Will we just laugh every time someone says ""o bhaiyya, aal izz well"" or will we subscribe to the fact that ""all's well""?]"
767,"[It happened one night. Or did it? A boy and a girl met at a party - only they are middle-aged. They are drunk, they are naughty. Is it inevitable for physics-chemistry-biology to play their role? If 'it' happened, would it be 'that' happened? If 'it' didn't happen, is it okay, even if the thought of doing the unmentionable occurred to both parties. Is it worse if one of them is married and the other is only attached without legalities coming in the way? All questions that might plague any drawing room conversation in urban suburbia. They are put forth subtly and with sensitivity. Also to maintain interest there is a nice build-up. But unfortunately it's towards an unworthy climax. So much so that everything thus far seems in vain.But, you look back and you realize though they didn't leave an impact there were interesting characters spread through the film. Each of the friends in the group is going through a different phase in his/her life. An elderly couple has come to terms with life as is and has found their way to enjoy it. Another couple seem to have a wonderful understanding of each other, so much so that they seemed to be bored of each other. And hence get themselves into situations that can complicate life. It might seem that they do it unnecessarily but maybe that's their way of keeping life interesting. Another couple is going through the initial phase of incompatibility, getting upset, and lovey-dovey cajoling. The interactions in the group tell you that even the simplest of people have complicated emotions.While the performances of most are as you'd expect - Rajat Kapoor, Ranvir Shorey. The one surprise is Dalip Tahil. Let alone talent, just seeing him do something different is refreshing. Thanks to whoever cast him, we get to see a non-caricatured Dalip. Also, one thing that I've always admired about Neha Dhupia is that though she does typical roles of a seductress, the films she chooses to do them in have something different about them. Here too she plays the mystery woman, pretty efficiently. Had it not been for the low budget-induced low-quality texture of the film, I think her performance would have been more effective.]"
768,"[Only an enthusiastic, never-say-die, determined, and crazy person could have brought films to India in that day and age. Importing and understanding mechanical equipment was considerably easy when you compared it to the taboo associated with doing anything out of the normal. An art form absolutely unknown to the masses, let alone go around stigma-free. And women working in a venture like this would be a social suicide. These are the odds we are transported to. Mokashi does a wonderful job of making this a light peek into the hard work without letting us get too sentimental or too stark a depiction of his hardship. He doesn't introduce us to the darker side of Phalke's life at all. His insecurities, the craze for his work completely taking over his life to the extent that his and his family's health is at stake. Not to mention the bleak financial situation that they were already in. While we can complain about the ever-smiling Phalke, the harshness is treated in the same tone as the rest of the film. Every once in a while the film switches to the 8mm and silent era feel albeit in color. And it adds humor and is in perfect context. Also you can't help but smile at the compare and contrast of how things have changed to today. For example, shunning anyone who wants to work towards his passion and go against the tide; the younger generation being more receptive to a new thing; the diminishing value of other forms of entertainment after the advent of the moving images; attempt of actors to steal more screen space from co-stars; we accord her on screen today; the need to imitate the technologies used in the west; the contrast between the mute but strong role a woman played in that time with the respect(?); the contrast between people applauding something as simple as the growth of a plant and the need for constant entertainment(?) now. The film is after all an obituary of sorts. To the 2 years that the Father of Indian cinema spent in making THE first Indian film Raja Harishchandra. And like an obituary it is polite and sweet. It is also an enchanting time travel to a century ago. Go for it and take the kids along!]"
769,"[The fight between passion and duty translates to a war between individualism and sacrifice of it. Individualism ain't a bad word. When you talk about your rights, you always would like to make decisions that'd make you happy, that keep you close to your passion. But these feelings begin to change when they are for others, especially when you see the other succeeding, and leaving his ""duty"" to rot. But his is the gray character we are and this is the gray character Guna is.I haven't a clue how to describe Atul Kulkarni's performance as Guna, except maybe to say that his depiction of a man going through a huge dilemma is one of the best, I've seen. Spellbinding! It certainly must not have been effortless and doesn't look like it either. In fact, I wonder, if preparing for this role changed him as a personality and a person. All the other performances are completely sidelined, and this time I don't feel too bad for them. The aspiring tamasha performer, Guna (Atul), comes from the lowest rung of poverty and lives in a remote village in Maharashtra. He's shunned by one and all, except for a few fellow will-do-anything-for-a-living friends. This situation creates a dilemma even in the viewer's mind. In such abject circumstances, is it right for Guna to pursue his dream? We, the educated, the open-minded have to remind ourselves that now that the question has come, the answer should be ""Why not?"" And you still struggle. Most of us might not have taken the steps Guna takes, if we were put in his situation. And yet, we know he's doing the right thing. His first service is to himself, ain't it? And this is only the main struggle the main character is going through. There are many issues the side-characters are struggling with. There are smaller issues that the Guna is struggling with. And you are aware of the constant tug-of-war between passion and duty. You also figure the various solutions different kinds of people have sought. There is an extremely valid point Natarang tries to make, which is not related to this tussle at all. That each of us has a masculine and feminine side to ourselves. Unfortunately, this takes the side-track and is never explored in detail. Another day, another film, maybe. For now, it is used to accentuate Guna's predicament. The problem though is that the spot that Guna is in takes the longest time to settle down. Until the interval, you are just a bystander, and don't feel much for Guna. It's only much later that the build-up takes you to a wonderful climax. It's one of those films that completely bowls you over as it progresses. It takes its time to grow on you, but if the feeling is that of satisfaction while walking out of the theater, it's only a minor crime.]"
770,"[Science, Commerce, Arts? - A very common question 20 years ago, when I was supposed to decide my line of interest at age 15. ""Commerce?"" - cool, you can do a CA, ICWA (MBA was a little too much to think of for a ""girl"" from my community). ""Science?"" - oh excellent. Engineers, Doctors, they have a lot of 'scope'. ""Arts?"" - Why would you do that to yourself? You are smart, intelligent, you scored well. No one talks about mere mortals. I went on to finish my CA, never practiced accountancy, and years later figured I'd like to watch movies and write about them. Only then did I know, there were actual books and courses I could have done that were closer to this field. Who do I blame? The system? Parents? Myself? A film that touches upon this theme, is sure to touch a chord within me, but...Shikshanachya aaicha gho says the system and over-ambitious, misguided parents are responsible. Fair enough. What's the solution? They haven't given a practical way to resolve this. I understand that the onus of providing a solution does not lie on a movie, but without that the film was seriously hollow. I'm told what I already know in a loud and brash manner. It doesn't really make me want to think about it after I'm out of the theater. Let alone take action to correct the wrong. What it does though is that it involves you in most parts for the two hours that you are there. You want to reach out to the guy who's heart is in cricket but is forced to learn 12*6. You want to shake his dad awake for cornering his boy thus. But, the resolution to the conflict comes very conveniently and harshly. In its way, the film tries to tell the parent, ""Look at what had to happen for you to realize you are wrong!"" And when the 'happy realization' dawns upon him, it creates an unrealistic monster. Reaching out to the higher ups in the system is surely a way, to correct the situation. But they make the system look unbelievably approachable. However, I liked the fact that our suffering parent was surrounded by the nicest of people. He had neighbors who'd help and money-sharks, who reached out to him. While it could be a little too good to be true, but I'd like to believe that the world is not that bad-a-place after all. Example, I have good neighbors, so there's no reason for a film to not have them. But barring that, the other stuff in the film, like the acting and dialogue, are more than annoying. The dialogue and the ""preachy"" tone in which it is delivered in has a very specific theatrical quality, which doesn't work in a film. Similarly, the acting looks more like it is for a live audience.While many of us would find the issue close to heart, somehow it lacked the depth and thought to seep deep into me. Though you see the angst that the makers and the characters might be feeling, it doesn't take you further. It's unfortunate, but it is a good start-off point for better films on this topic. ]"
771,"[A line in one of the songs translates to - There's no foreigner to burn you,Nor a Gandhi to put out the fire-   Implying of course, that there's a fire for sure. You have created it, you need to put it out. There's no enemy and no savior other than you.Zhenda tells you what this fire is, in current-day Maharashtra. The political situation created by the power-controllers in the system, and the resultant change in social dynamics of the common man, including the party-workers. And it does so pretty efficiently and effectively.Some powerful, smart dialogues, some realistic performances, and a story that could be as real as possible - Zhenda is an intriguing affair right from the beginning. The first few minutes create curiosity about the complex political mesh prevailing in the state. And then you are introduced to nitty-gritty using a few representative examples - a couple of party-workers, an aspiring politician, their friends, family, and other supporters. It then comes down to two specific party-workers who are greatest of friends and as situation demands fall into different factions of political party. Each thinks he supports an ideology. But both are victims to blind faith and misguided loyalty. Though it's pretty much predictable that a film making a political comment will have character arcs that can go only a certain way, but it is interesting to see each one develop. The transition of each character is marked by the function of power he controls and the priority in his life. A non-believer in politics, an ace marketing guy, gains power and his priority changes from aspiring to move to the US to something completely unthought-of for him. A completely brainwashed political party-worker realizes his worth in the political system through his negative experiences and takes control of matters. The role of family and personal career growth is somehow inversely proportionate to the power you can exude. There are a few things that leave question marks. Is it so easy for a party-worker to go off on his own? And you try to convince yourself. Maybe - considering they aren't that valued in the first place. But that's the film. The bravery needed to make such statements and have a story and characters so similar to real life figures is a remarkable deed in itself. To take it a step further, and take on, arguably, a political family most ""popular"" for taking on to violence to prove a point - the Thakareys - could be considered martyrdom, by some. But, Avdhoot Gupte does it and does it well, without flinching. I am tempted to call it a documentary. A visual documentation of the situation created by our ""leaders"" in the state we live in, in the last few years. We, the ones who are not politically involved, at least not enough to join a party, are bystanders and get a peek into the lives of those who believe in their leaders with eyes closed. It is targeted towards these people and poses a question on their behalf -Vithhalla, konta dharu me zhenda?O Lord, which flag should I hold up (support, fight for)?And the only answer seems to be, ""none, really."" I wish the unsaid mention there is ""None other than your national flag, dear ones, none other than that...""]"
772,"[Steve Martin is back again as Inspector Jacques Clouseau in the Pink Panther 2, in what seems to be a really ridiculous attempt to keep the franchise going.  Right at the onset, I must confess that I am not a great fan of Steve Martin.Yes, I have seen some of his films; Sgt Bilko, The Father of the Bride are the names that come to mind.  I have also seen Planes, Trains, and Automobiles as well as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.  As films I enjoyed the last two more, primarily because you had John Candy and Michael Caine respectively, acting in them.  But Steve Martin had never really left an impression on me with respect to his comic abilities.The role of the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau was initially played by the great comic genius, Peter Sellers, in five films, all directed by Blake Edwards.  Some of the films were really funny, with Sellers in great form, as the French Detective.  So it was very difficult to watch Steve Martin enact the character and not compare it with Seller's version, even though one knows that comparisons might prove to be inherently unfair.(I believe that Steve Martin has been crying himself hoarse saying that he has not played Clouseau as Sellers would have done, but instead interpreted it differently).The plot is shopworn and is a reworking of the earlier Pink Panther films.  The supporting cast are all fine actors with the likes of Andy Garcia, Alfredo Molina, Lily Tomlin, Jean Reno, and heaven help us, Jeremy Irons.  They have absolutely nothing to do in the film except look foolish and irritated at alternate intervals.  Yes, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is there too, as Sonia, but she is mainly kept in the background.  John Cleese plays Dreyfuss, Clouseau's boss (a role made famous by Herbert Lom in the original Pink Panther films) and he is completely wasted too.The screenplay really lets the film down; it is extremely predictable and seems to consist only of the gags.  When it tries to do other things, it ends up creating the character of Mrs. Berenger (played by Lily Tomlin) who tries to teach Clouseau political correctness.  This could have been the basis of a whole set of witty dialogues / situations parodying today's world, but no, what we get instead are very banal and boring situations.Steve Martin struts around through a series of set piece slapstick gags, but the gags are flat and insipid.  There is not a single gag that makes you laugh hilariously; you have Martin as the Pope, you have Martin choosing wine, you have Martin investigating a large mansion, you have Martin as a flamenco dancer, and you have Martin practicing karate with his side kick's children (another reworking from the original Peter Seller's films), but it all comes across as extremely labored.  The most irritating thing about Martin is his accent; with Sellers, the faux French accent was hilarious, with Martin it is the equivalent of a red, itchy rash that one would like to get rid of post haste.  Martin maintains an immobile visage, his face frozen into something between a pout and a sneeze.  The climax is as hackneyed as the rest of the movie, with Martin jumping and dodging various objects.Slapstick routines require terrific physicality as in a Buster Keaton or a Charlie Chaplin; Martin unfortunately just does not have it.  He also does not have the superb timing, the confidence, and the varied body language that Peter Sellers' Clouseau had; neither is Martin a master of disguise.  Martin comes across as a total chump busy clowning around desperately in order to attract attention. (Or is that his interpretation of Clouseau?)  The film is a total bummer; the only sounds of laughter were from a bunch of ten year olds in the theatre. I would like to think that they laughed the loudest when Martin was getting the worst of it.  Need anything more be said?PS It was a pleasure to hear the theme music again: the only saving grace of the film is the excellent background score by Christophe Beck.]"
773,"[The first scene of Rocket Singh makes you wonder if you are watching Wake Up Sid all over again. A not-so-good-at-academics protagonist will find his groove in this big bad world. While the premise might be the same, the apparatus used is entirely different. No generic heart-strings pulled for ""aaaaws"" from the audience. A straightforward, no riff-raff film that you can identify with. And you will laugh your way through the everyday sense of humor it carries. BE WARNED THOUGH: it is not your regular Yash Raj film with a bright song every 10th minute. It's not one where the editor went zip-zapp-zooom to create a fast pace or a shorter film. It's slowish. It's longish. And if I were an impatient viewer, those would be my first and last complaints. And since I'm not, I have more reasons to rejoice, a few quibbles here and there, as scribbled in the notepad section.I'm willing to sit in the beloved dark hall a little longer and watch things build-up slowly. Just in case I miss the finer details that have been paid attention to by the makers, the ones that might have helped create that warm atmosphere and yet maintain a hostile environment. Don't want to run that risk. Especially when one of the most well-known banners in the industry ""Yash Raj Films"" is taking the huge risk of getting rid of the female lead altogether and having a minimum of songs. An hour into the movie and I, a fan of the non-standard Hindi films, wanted to scream ""Where's the GIRL?"" And what a huge risk that is for budding ""star"" Ranbir Kapoor too. But like they say, even superheroes take risks. Why shouldn't our heroes, then? Many of us don't aspire to much. If we aren't one of them, we know someone very closely, who is happy with what they get and don't think they deserve any better. Our man, Harpreet Singh Bedi (Ranbir Kapoor) is one of them. He doesn't meddle with his life too much. Until, one day, realization dawns. And let me not scare you. It's not the epiphany waiting to happen. It is a slow, gradual call on the self. You'll see yourself, if you went through what Harpreet went through with his baggage of values. Rocket Singh is also a detailed comment on how the corporate world and more specifically, cut-throat sales departments work. The sleaze is shown, but you don't puke, because it is shown so matter-of-factly. After all, you run that rat-race too. And remarkably the character transitions are very believable too. An academically challenged commerce student doesn't turn into a superhuman in a skill set he thinks he's good at. When the tables turn, they do so subtly. The sweet talk, lies and malice turn into shrewd judgment calls. The ""anti-heroes"" are no dumbwits or ""just-do-it"" bosses. They can walk the talk too. And all of this with sharp dialogues. In fact, the first half hour reminded me of two TV series that I admire the most for their crisp dialogues - West Wing and Sports Night. These shows were written by Aaron Sorkin who also wrote one of my favorite dramas A few good men and one of my favorite rom-coms The American President. So, if I'm thinking of Aaron Sorkin and my favorite Hindi writer-director Hrishikesh Mukherjee at the same time, the writer of this film, Jaideep Sahni has done his job! You see guys, I had no choice but to love this film. But this also means the film is full of dialogues. Back and forth and back. If you are refraining from creating a non-loud Sikh character, you have done your job well! It's such a shame that this is good enough. And the task of creating other believable office-going characters seems like only a mild achievement. Obviously none of this would have come through if the actors didn't do their jobs or they weren't given direction. You want the idealistic protagonist to stick to his guns but you want him to succeed too. But, you do know that in this day and age you are asking for the impossible, because you want a realistic film too. And you make such a demand only because your hopes have risen due to the perfect casting. From the technician  Mishraji (Mukesh Bhatt) to Giri despite his uneven Hyderabadi accent (or is it Telangana now? :) ). You want to hug them all. And of course you want to beat up that brat of a boss, Mr. Suri. So fresh is this cast, that despite detailed searches on the net, I can't figure out which character is played by whom. The search is on, meanwhile, dear readers, if you know, drop me a line.But before you do any of that, go catch this sales-guy before he achieves his targets! He's not selling a product or a service. He's out there selling a value system. Remember, selling, not preaching. So you just might buy it. You know you want to.]"
774,"[When I start writing my opinion of a film, I usually close my eyes looking for that one thought that is a wholesome description of the film. In most cases, where an actor's name does the deal, the film doesn't have a substantial plot. It would fall apart if that actor was not playing the said character. This doesn't hold true for Paa. The first thought and the last one are Amitabh Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan only. But what comes in between is extremely valuable to the audience's experience and to the core of the film. Sure, there are many aspects pertaining to the challenges a single parent faces while managing a child with a rare disease. But, there are enough nuances touched upon to make the viewing worthwhile. That is, if such a performance is not gratifying enough.My apprehension before the film was that the entire do will become about Amitabh Bachchan, the star or the real life father-son relationship or equally worse, a combination of both. I'm so glad my apprehensions were absolutely uncalled for. You realize Auro is Amitabh Bachchan only when you make yourself think about it. Else you wouldn't even realize its him. Of course, a lot of that is due to the make-up artiste. Any talk of the film without a salute to the make-up person and the costume designer would be a complete disregard for these art forms. And yet, none of them would have been enough if it wasn't for the stooped shoulder, the expressive eyes, the quivering lips, and so on.  Now, before this piece becomes an essay on the Big B, let's move on to the other aspects of the film. You but cannot refrain from nodding your head in approval at the portrayal of politics even if it is mostly over-idealistic. Amitabh's performance along with Vidya Balan's elegant composure completely overshadows Abhishek Bachchan's depiction of the young, dynamic politician we so badly need. And despite dealing with such heavy topics as these, the entire film has a very light tone, right to the end. Every time the going gets a little serious, little Auro, has something hilariously spontaneous to say - just like children always do. Then there are these things which are over-simplified. Like the overall compassion with which people from all ages and backgrounds treat an abnormal child. Also, the social acceptance of an illegitimate child and his mother was a tad too uneasy to digest. It is obvious that these issues were intentionally left out of the equation to help focus on the characters and their relationships. But these issues are conspicuous by their absence. Similarly, the whole comment on parents' complete disregard to anything creative as a source of living was in bad taste. A wee bit exaggerated it was, in order to get those extra laughs. Also, the maturity that 12-13 year olds show seems a bit beyond their age. The climax too seems a little too melodramatic compared to the tone of the rest of the film. Usually, films that deal with topics as varied as politics and rare genetic conditions leave you with a feeling that it should have been 2 different films, but this one blended the two together very well. Or they are interesting enough that you don't mind seeing them at one go. It was almost as if these are the two burning issues R. Balki wanted to talk about and he had only one film to do it in. At the very least, Paa documents the state of media and current affairs of the country in the naughts. For the longest time now, I've been waiting for an Amitabh film that I really enjoyed. Finally, it's here. I wouldn't want to adjoin any more superlatives to his performance and the challenges he must have faced in getting it all right, I would want you to go and find out for yourself. Yes, you there...go get those tickets for you and your family!]"
775,"[""All Muslim's are terrorists."" In order to prove that the Western world thinks that way, Rensil D'Souza and Karan Johar go that extra mile to showcase the very same thing. And, hopefully inadvertently, complete the circle and cast the despicable stereotype in a deeper mould. Why are good Islamic citizens left out? Ok, I'm taking the same route and exaggerating a bit here. But only a bit. A couple of Muslim characters in Kurbaan are not fundamentalists and are not blind followers of their religion. But just 2-3 between 12-13 main characters can see that their faith is being misused. That's a gross overstatement of the human race's irrationality. And even if I'm naive that that's how things are. How does decorating that fact with a star couple help? Saif Ali Khan plays Ehsaan and is rather stiff. Somehow, he doesn't seem at ease with the character. Except for a few scenes with Kareena Kapoor (Avantika, the girl next door). And those scenes are really well-done. Kareena looks the prettiest without make-up on and is by-far the most huggable sight when her character is supposed to cry. This woman can act. It's a pity only a few directors find her potential size-exponential worth exploring too. The rest of the cast except for Vivek Oberoi are just doing their drill. No record-breaking performances asked for, none given. Physical intimacy is not something Indian filmmakers are very good at. But, here there's nothing crude and both actors fit just right. Now, whether the scene was a ""script ki maang"" (need of the script) or not is very debatable. And clearly, this much-talked about scene is as predictable and lame as ever. The pre-release attention that the scene has been intentionally awarded with makes the timing even more obvious. That still doesn't take away from the fact that it is worth every marketing penny spent on the skin-show. Delicious! And these things are major let-downs after the slick title sequence. It's so refreshing, especially when you are expecting a Dharma Productions product to bank on a crisp, fresh view of the New York skyline. Thankfully, the smart production values continue after that. The background score and actually, the lack of it for almost two-thirds of the film is not only worth a round of applause but it also tried its best to keep you focused on the acting and reacting. Some great work by the Foley artist. Similarly, the framing of individual shots are very engaging. They are different and try their best to build the curiosity.  But, neither sound nor visuals can take the place of the story and more importantly of the details that make the story. They all take the beaten path. The community that the terrorists belong to feel marginalized and the only way to deal with that is to shoot on sight - even people belonging to their own community, it is martyrdom after all. Every time someone on screen said that, I felt my skin crawl. I'm sure the line, like many other done-to-death dialogues, was a really strong statement when it was used the first time. But, now you know that argument and want to hear the real people talking. Especially because the makers are very clear about making this a serious, dark film. How in such a case can a small terrorist group act in a void, by themselves, with no apparent help from outside? And it's not like we are following one or the other character's story. It's all plain and stagnant. They want to kill, kill, kill and they kill, kill, kill. Over 5 hours after the film and I still can't figure out what the purpose of the film is. To entertain? It got way too many unintentional laughs, right down to the convenient glass of milk showing up as expected. To tell a story? Whose? Avantika's? I know nothing about her except that she's a professor in psychology with no apparent insight into human nature. Though her struggle to be in love and the resultant helplessness is obvious. Ehsaan's? Maybe. But how much do we really know about him? He is in dilemma. Sure, but what about it? I don't empathize with him, I don't hate him, because I haven't a clue why he does what he does.  The story of a terror attack? Which one? The one in the planning of which I wasn't allowed to participate? The games and counter-games seem to be serving no particular end.I don't like the tone of such films that almost feel like they take pleasure in reinforcing the stereotype. Where's the balance? Where's the grey? Where's the human face of cold-blooded murder? It does have one, or doesn't it? Are our film-makers claiming that there are absolutely no non-Muslims involved in these acts of terror?]"
776,"[I am one of those who believes that the same old story can be told with a fresh style and thus still entertain. Unfortunately the converse is also true. The same old story can be told in a dull, soporific style and bore you to the core. You know where I'm leading you with this one - Tum Mile falls in the second category - boring. The one line plot is as simple as it can be. Boy meets girl (as clarified in the title), they fall in love, something happens they fall out of it and the climax will tell you whether finally boy meets girl or not. Now within these confines the freshness could be in how they meet, how they start liking each other, what misunderstanding/personality clash is thrown in, etc. All these things are sort-of close to real-life. We are sure to know people and couples like these. But, here real also translates to hands-down monotonous. The situations are sorry enough, the dialogues attempt to add flavor but don't succeed very much. And in such state of affairs, how much can the actors do? Both Emraan Hashmi and Soha Ali Khan are delighted, sorry, shy, frustrated, helpless as the script requires them to be. All good but still mind-numbing. And the two of them create nothing special together. No longing in me for them to be together. No reason for me to feel good when they are all lovey-dovey, nor for me to feel pain when they are trying hard to keep those tears in. In all this mundane humdrum there is one thing that sticks out. The lead lady character has a personality that she stands by. She's not whimsical and neither does she have an obsessive compulsive disorder. She's a regular girl with her own aspirations and easy-going ways. She will bend backward for her man and snap every time her back protests. And yet I don't empathize with a girl or the boy who have come from South Africa for a day to Bombay and get stuck in the oh-so-rotten monsoons. It's nothing against the characters. It's the way the entire episodes are narrated. So emotionless, so...so lifeless. Why should I care if they suffer like Rose did in Titanic? They couldn't create an ounce of what I felt for her. And that is very atypical of a Bhatt film. Whoever the director, there is enough of a twist in the story and enough interaction within the audience for them to react, to love, to hate. But, here I am sitting, bored even to finish writing this review. Nope, no good memorable tunes or lyrics in the songs either! :(]"
777,"[The Watchmen has for long remained one of the most inaccessible of the graphic novels, inaccessible when it came to transposing it to the big screen.  The novel is dense, multi textured, and works on at least three levels.   It has a plot which is highly nuanced and extremely well detailed, its characters are a far cry from the standard ""super hero"" genre, and its themes remain extremely contemporary and disturbing.The audience for this movie would clearly be divided into two, those who have read the novel and would want it to be replicated down to its tiniest detail, and those who have not and who would see the film as ""normal"" viewers.  The former would be the legions and hordes of fans that have analysed and discussed the novel and its symbolisms, allusions, and connotations ad nauseam, while the latter would by and large have no clue about what they are to encounter.I belong to the first group and therefore it is really difficult for me to write about the film as a ""normal"" viewer.  Comparisons with the novel are unavoidable, but I have tried to restrict it to a minimum.Let me then start with the screen play.  The novel has enough material to make a mini series, but to fit into a big screen format it has been reduced to a running time of just less than three hours.  The screenplay has been pared down to the essentials that help keep the plot moving and simultaneously introduce us to the ""Watchmen"", a group of ""superheroes"", by way of multiple back stories and flashbacks.  A lot of detail and intricacies have been sacrificed for cinematic convenience.  The director tries to make up for this by packing a lot of cues into every frame; cues that help the viewer understand that the universe of the Watchmen is not ""real"", but an imagined alternate one.  So there are news paper headlines, images on television that reference to real life incidents of the 70's and 80's, TV interviews, and the presence of at least five historical characters including Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger.The title sequence is ingenious, a series of sequential images in ""slow still motion"", that depict the passing of time and concomitant changes.  The entire title sequence is set to Bob Dylan's 'The times they are a Changing', and it comes off very well.  In fact certain iconic songs are used very well in the film, Simon and Garfunkel's 'Sounds of Silence' beautifully underscores the mood of another sequence.  What I really loved was the wailing, wrenching, Jimi Hendrix version of Bob Dylan's apocalyptic 'All along the Watchtower', which sets the mood for the surreal climax.The acting is top notch, the actors are ""unknowns"", all barring Billy Crudup who plays Dr Manhattan, all naked, godlike, and blue to boot.  Crudup's acting is superb, his character seems detached from human concerns, but through his soft voice and facial movements, he creates a persona that comes across as vulnerable, powerful, but yet deeply human.  Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre 2 is sometimes jarring, but she does well enough, as her role really does not demand too much.  But the prize goes to Jackie Earl Haley who plays Rorschach.  He dons a mask through out the film, we get to see his face only in the end and that too briefly, but through his hoarse rasping voice and the set of his shoulders, he conveys his uncompromising morality.  He is aided by the fact that some of the most powerful dialogues (mostly as a voice over) belong to him. Director Zach Snyder is good with CGI, going by his previous film 300.  Here he does not overdo the special effects; the visual impact of Dr Manhattan's character is very well done.  The film makes an effort to replicate the panels of the graphic novel as far as possible and the visual composition is very well designed. For a ""superhero"" movie, there are hardly any action scenes, just two to be precise, involving fisticuffs.  They seem rather redundant and are downplayed; the movie could easily have done without them. The climax is rather disappointing and this is the movie's fatal flaw.  The climax just does not have enough punch, and it comes across as rather tame and inconsequential.   This could possibly be due to two reasons; in the novel it is the atmosphere and the ambience created that matter more than the outcome, or it could be due to the fact that the elaborate plot deals with larger metaphysical concerns which do not translate too well cinematically, or well, both.For those who have not read the novel, the film might be difficult to grasp (this is what some of my ""normal viewer"" friends have told me).  But for those who have the courage, it might well be worth the effort to watch this film.  The film is good, but definitely not great.  One does get a feel of the ""Watchmen"" universe all right, hopefully a viewing might prompt some film goers to lay their hands on what for my money, is the best graphic novel till date.]"
778,"[Friends are forever or maybe they are not. Or maybe they become best of friends except for that thin line that still keeps them apart. Does being human mean taking care of yourself or does it mean giving yourself to one and all? Can a human be so selfish or so selfless? Both nauseating in their own way? Well, it takes all kinds to make this world. And that I guess makes it an interesting place to live in albeit insane. Yes. A Vipul Amrutlal Shah film made me think beyond what was going on, on screen. And this is, despite having a few of the quintessential Hindi film touches to it.That's because it ALSO had broader non-standard and pleasantly surprising strokes. Example, there's no one event or line that transforms the good to evil or vice versa, the character is written in such a way that the transition is smooth. Another such stroke, which I thought made this entire film worth its while, was Arjun's (Ajay Devgn's) character. His traits established, the passion that drives him to his goal and maybe even to insanity. Whether or not he achieves his goal and/or insanity is for you to go and watch. And that's the beauty. The film maintains a dark-ish atmosphere where you know anything could happen and it's equally likely that the film won't end on a popular note. And that keeps the interest alive. Ajay, of course, makes and maintains the serious ambience through the film. The twitches and the way the eyes move to disclose what's on Arjun's mind are not to be missed. But, then again it's a mainstream Hindi film and it keeps reminding you of that. For instance, almost all the other characters are pretty much flat. Including Manu (Salman Khan) and Priya (Asin). And the actors didn't do much with whatever little scope their characters had either. Salman Khan is his usual stuff. His comic timing is best at some of the really funny lines given to him. It's amazing how the man can do the same thing over and over and over and still have his fans cheering and hooting for him all through. Though in this one there are a few dashes of facial muscle movement here and there. In a script that did so much with the male protagonist, it's a shame that the lead woman was so etchily sketched. She could have been more involved. She could at the very least have not disappeared from one of the most crucial plot points in the film! The show-down is a bit too much to swallow. And the climax came way too quickly and was abrupt. Yes, and I'm still complaining about its length. It's sad when a film is long and you still find something amiss. Whatever the drawbacks of the film are in terms story or dialogues the improvement, in the entertainment-quotient of these two departments (of a Vipul Shah film) came as a pleasant surprise. And so did the aesthetics in terms of cinematography and sound design. Maybe just losing Akshay Kumar might have done the trick. Ok, sorry, couldn't resist that unwarranted dig. It's a film that makes you want the hero to win and the anti-hero to not lose. You flinch when the latter is punished and want to reach out to him and tell him it's ok. This one also has a strong hard work vs. talent+charisma debate as a backdrop. But the drama goes on a tad too long. Long enough for you to notice the holes in the other departments. And there they lose us. ]"
779,"[You could call it the Hindi Harry Potter 7-crushed into-1 with a dash of X-men thrown in. Or, for that matter, you can look at it as any other super-hero story. BUT, you could also think of Aladin as a huge step forward for Hindi films in terms of graphics and cute imagination - however small it might be. Don't expect any sort of deviation from the writing department though. Oops! Did I just give the movie away? Oh well, not like you wouldn't guess that in the first 5 minutes. Also, you still don't know how a dim-wit like Aladin (Riteish Deshmukh) manages to keep the evil forces from taking over. There are no fascinating revelations about life and human behavior. There are no aims loftier than power. I don't know about you? But, I thought Aladin was all about adventures, but this is more like a love story. The first thing that takes you by awe in the first 15-20 minutes or so is the lovely sets. The sand-colored stones, the fortress like look is done really well and you know you are in fairly land with spurts of color showing up on the screen. You are in this town that is more-or-less nameless and is not bound in time. You will see TVs but they have wood-finished remote controls. You have the milkman's cycle and vintage cars. The other special effects are also fascinating. I wondered if it was just because I was seeing this in a Hindi film. And the answer was a resounding NO! I would have equally appreciated it in a film from any part of the world. The action sequences are smoothly cut and put together. The camera moves lyrically and somehow never gets me out of the story book. Unfortunately, there's nothing else that's above the average here. I shouldn't be repeating too often that the story is oft-repeated. :) Not only that, it slacks down quite a bit after the first half hour. Also there are jumps in the story that make you feel like you are watching a movie based on a book and they lost 50 pages after every 50 pages. The intriguing suspense in the beginning is not built further and is sorted-out pretty disappointingly. The acting I guess requires everyone to behave a little over-the-top. I'm not the loud-act-makes-me-laugh audience, so I wouldn't know if the people who like that would enjoy it. I just think it's a lame excuse in the name of appealing to the kids. We should be developing better tastes in the next generation. But, given that they are supposed to act loud and larger-than-life Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjay Dutt enchant. We knew they are capable of it, and we see it again. Oh, how my heart sinks in giving a movie starring the Big B a low rating. You want to look only at this 65-year in a screen full of dancers. How he pulls off an entire song and makes elegant, the simplest of choreography ... sigh oh well...Riteish Deshmukh too succeeds, what looks like effortlessly, in playing the larger-than-life idiot! Some of the scenes with two Aladin's on screen (just like that!) make you respect him even more as an actor. Even if those were the only two expressions he could hold. And what's so special about Jacqueline Fernandez, again? Not her chalk-white face with whiter make-up, right? And those songs get one too many and thus way too often and spoil that for you too! For those who are not into Hollywood, this one is a must-must-watch! Others could say, ""baah! I've seen it in Hollywood - like 100 times over."" Or you could watch it like you would watch the next Holly-thriller-action-superhero movie with a typical No-one-can-save-the-world-but-me plotline. And yet, if there were a sequel, I would look forward to it, because all hope's not lost.]"
780,"[The on-screen activity had the entire theater in splits! People around me couldn't stop laughing their guts out. So funny did they find the jokes and situations that the gags kept them happy through the unnecessary emotional scenes too. No-no, the audience was chuckling with the characters, not at them. I - well I didn't see the humor through most of the film. Somehow - hit-the-crotch, eunuchs-exist-that's-so-funny, Draupadi-like-undrape-Sari, people-falling-off-stairs, slapping-each-other, modified-cake-fights - don't even make me smile, smirk maybe, but nowhere near the grin-region. However, when I laughed at the other jokes, I laughed real hard.I don't understand what's so weird or whacky about Prem (Ranbir Kapoor) or about his style of love. Nor do I understand what's so unusual about his story. Not a crime so far, even if you claim those things in the title. The onus of originality is not on you when the entire industry is ""referencing."" But get there in a way that is wholesome and entertaining. The sure way of doing that is with some howlarious dialogue, especially when you don't have much in terms of character arcs or story development going on. That they manage in fits and spurts. There is another way to enjoy the do, just pre-decide, you are going to enjoy, and you might too. The lead pair is another thing that might keep you going. Ranbir Kapoor plays the perfect Prem (Barjatya reference for the uninitiated). Charming and saccharine sweet. He has shades of Sunil, who tries to evoke Prem's darker side. Yes, he's aaawww-cho-chwweet. Diabetics might want to stay away. There's this one sequence in which he does a Jim Cary a la The Mask and is pretty hilarious too. Now, why he's doing that, don't ask! And oh yeah, remember slapstick? Yes, Ranbir is loud in this one!Boys, Katrina Kaif is as lovely, to look at, as ever - even though she's in Sunday-Morning-Mass dresses through the film. Meaning - not much in terms of sensuous skin-show. She doesn't let that affect her performance though. Same ol' accent, same straight face, a similar ol' attempt at shedding glycerin tears.On the brighter side, there's no first half-second half syndrome here. It is in one continuum - few emotional scenes, a few good laughs, loads of slapstick, and mucho silliness. Oh yeah... and 2-3 songs. The problem is in each of these, you find Santoshi trying to imitate some movie or director. And why not, right? Especially when you can pay tribute to Cinema Paradiso and Maine Pyaar Kiya all in one go! And if not anyone else, there's always an annoying self-reference to bank on. Reminding us of what could have been. It's Tom and Jerry style humor, alright. But, it doesn't have a quarter of the recall value. And the saddest part is that it's a desperate effort for a repeat performance by Rajkumar Santoshi. And that part is pretty obvious. If only being yourself wasn't that difficult. A wannabe Andaz Apna Apna. And not very successful at that. ]"
781,"[A Jail - the subject matter is so grim that the treatment can only be depressing. You see a few characters but it's the jail that adds, deletes and depletes what had defined them thus far. Parag (Niel Nitin Mukesh) is the one you care for, you want him to get out of this jail. And while doing that, you are sucked in; in to the atmosphere, living one day at a time - sometimes hopeful, some days aimless. And you want to avoid acknowledging that creepy feeling - real life prisons must only be worse. And this is because Parag turns narrator and you see this essay through his eyes. The plot moves on only because life does. What is shown is mostly what we know already. And yet we must have seen only a small percentage of what really goes on in those barracks. We don't see the boredom a prisoner must have gone through. Why should we care? They are the ones who have defecated society. We have to live in their fear. They might as well rot here to the fullest before they are sent to hell. But then, there are also the ones who repent, the one-time offenders, and ... the innocent - yet to be put on trial or worse - proven guilty. You also are introduced to the other inmates of these jails - the policemen in-charge. What a thankless job that is!? What crime did they commit to be forced to spend their days and nights with the worst that humanity offers?  Let alone the day-to-day problems they face from the higher ups, the judicial system, the politicians and their own family. Yes, Madhur Bhandarkar has taken upon himself to sensitize his audience to the plight of the people who live in a world we know exists and choose to ignore. He does so in a matter-of-fact tone. He doesn't sermonize, he doesn't glamorize. He just opens the door and ironically lets it be so. Writer Madhur, has chosen one representative for each set of people that constitute an Indian jail. He doesn't necessarily fill in the flesh in detail, but there's enough for us to make a fair judgment about the characters. Parag doesn't say much. But even if you don't take into account the acting skills used, there's a lot in the writing that tells you about him. There are other characters narrating similar feelings and you know what he's thinking. It is extremely well-woven into the narrative. There is actually only one main character in the film. And it's risky - banking on just one actor, not even a lady lead to stride alongside. The bet worked. You don't miss more detailed characters. His misery, his hope are enough to agonize you through the 2 hours. Manoj Bajpai is only a bonus. The two show what silence can convey. The plot cannot be broken down into an introduction, a conflict, and a climax. The first and last parts are way too short. In fact the climax seems too simple and quick. The pace suddenly changes and it ends almost abruptly. But, even so, there's no preaching, there's no epilogue. And that must have been a difficult-to-resist temptation.This is an autobiography of a prison. Not one prisoner or two. But it's a peek into a few years of a jail's life. Inmates come and inmates go. You see it, you smell it, you sense it. Parag's misfortune - of being at the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong person - is only incidental. But you will be thinking constantly of the people he represents - the innocent.]"
782,"[So when a guileless Salman Khan worshipper like myself, gets ready at 8 in the morning,(and mind you, GETS READY and not just WAKES UP), to go for the latest Salman Khan movie, the least she (or in some cases, he) can expect is for that movie to be a Salman Khan movie, right? Wrong. Apparently, nowadays, it's okay to lead the audience on. You can show them something and not deliver. So when you project Main aur Mrs. Khanna as a Salman Khan starrer, you can get away with ensuring that the Khan with an attitude makes a single appearance on either side of the interval. Main aur Mrs. Khanna, to say the least, is the work of an extremely confused filmmaker. Perhaps, Prem Soni, the director, screenplay, story, and dialogue writer (phew!) of this movie, started off with a fair idea of what he wanted to show, but somewhere in the middle, just lost it. What could otherwise have been a pretty good movie turned into a so-so fare by the average treatment meted out to it. The plot is interesting but it is let down by a loose screenplay. Also, a film like Main aur Mrs. Khanna could have done with a lot more drama in it. The main flaw, however, in Main aur Mrs. Khanna lies in characterization. The characters, especially the lead characters, are not etched definitively. If you were to define a singular character in the movie in just about one word, you wouldn't be able to do so. For that matter, even if you were given as many words you liked, you still wouldn't be able to do so. Primarily because right till the end of the movie, you have no idea WHO these people are. Sure you know their names, you know their profession. But the connect that a viewer has with a character, is sorely missed. We don't feel for Kareena when she cries, nor do we laugh when she laughs. This movie commits the cardinal sin of being just something that we are watching on the big screen - it forms no relation with its audience.  The first half is slightly flat but the tempo picks up a little in the second half. In fact, the second half can squeeze quite a few laughs out of you. Just when you think that the movie might just start living up to your expectations, the plot falls flat again. The end is, in fact, very patchy and some details in the end are just plain unnecessary. Another sphere where the movie lacks is the chemistry between the lead pair. A movie that is trying to put across a message about love and relationships simply cannot do without absolutely sizzling chemistry between the lead (or so the promos say) couple. The missing chemistry, however, is not the actors' fault it is more the director and story/screenplay writer's fault. He just hasn't etched characters strong enough to portray any sort of relationship.The look of the movie otherwise is good. The locales are good, as is Kareena's styling. From the glam doll in Kambakht Ishq to girl-next-door (or at least Kareena's version of it), Kareena's look has definitely undergone a change. However, it is at odds with the character she plays. How can an orphan afford such expensive clothes?  Salman is well, just Salman. No need to say anymore. He looks good and acts like he always does. However, the age is definitely beginning to show a little, and the whole 'young couple' look kind of goes for a toss. Sohail Khan has probably delivered his best performance to date in this movie (which isn't saying much, considering he has acted in movies like Aryan; but he is quite good here). Yash Tonk is funny in bits and unnoticeable in other bits. Nauheed Cyrusi and Mahek Chahal might as well have been carved out of stone and Dino Morea had a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance. The surprise package of the movie came in the form Bappi Lahiri, who was in his element as Kareena's boss.  Music is passable, with just one track, Don't Say Alvida standing out. Preity Zinta's item song is just about okay. Choreography is not spectacular or even noticeable. Other technical aspects are just okay, though the flashback technique, of going into a black and white zone, looks quite nice.  Salman Khan fans might be a tad bit disappointed, though, with the size of his role. Watch only if you must. Till then keep guessing ki 'Kiski Mrs. Khanna' (whose Mrs. Khanna). ]"
783,"[Sometime earlier this week, a friend suggested that all I'd need to do for the review of All the Best is to copy-paste the review of Golmaal Returns. I laughed it off then. On Diwali-eve, I'm so tempted to use that suggestion as really well-meaning and useful advice. But, non-plagiarizers that we are, here you go. (And if don't care for the details, the rating says it all. Golmaal Returns is not recommended and neither is All The Best.)There are these two buffoons who are the creative types, so they obviously can't earn for themselves - Prem, Prem Chopra (Ajay Devgan) and Veer (Fardeen Khan). But they have expensive tastes and style of living. So, of course they beg, borrow, AND steal. And lie, lie to cover that lie and so on. And of course, a successful business tycoon, more gullible than the average nincompoop, Dharam (Sanjay Dutt) completes the circle. Yeah, that's the kind of ""plot"" we are looking at. (Of course, you can choose not to look at it, I didn't.) Add to it the endless stream of caricatured characters who add to the commotion. But, there is this razor-thin silver lining to this dark cloud - there are a few good one liners every once in a while. And they are delivered pretty subtly, especially in comparison to the rest of the movie. The understated tone in which the lines just come make them funnier too. But they are only few and not worth spending those extra calories you've put on this festive season. Enjoy the extra weight, seriously. Nothing else is subtle about the rest of the show though. The acting is loud and the background music is louder. And when that's deemed ""not enough"" there is this shriek-track played in addition to the background score. Supposedly to make us laugh or NOT! There isn't anything stylish or cool or worth-watching about the actors' appearances either. The women are wearing the lousiest of outfits and are made up way too much. The men are in their usual slapsticky mode, cracking a few toilet jokes, a few innuendoes and the occasional witty line. So mundane is that there is no amount of oomph their presence could add. Not that they are the best lookers in the industry anyway. A lot of older films are referred to. Maybe they are supposed to be tributes. But looked more like insults both in the way they were used AND because the film that's paying a tribute also needs to be of a certain basic quality to consider itself worthy of paying that tribute, right? There is this slight comment on undying friendship and the extent to which the best of friends can go to save each others' skin. And there are a couple very sweet moments between Ajay Devgan and his screen partner Bipasha Basu. The fact that they worked for me despite coming towards the end of a tiring film, means all the contributors to those shots did their job really well. If only there were more of those.Yes, guys, go watch that diya burn. Your Diwali will be happier by avoiding this one.]"
784,"[Blue is a perfectly good example of what money can't buy-quality. With its expansive canvas, produced at an estimated 100 crores, Blue is a sheer waste of money not only for the financiers but also for the audiences. The crew comprises of two oscar winners - Musician AR Rehman and Sound Designer Resul Pookutty, Pete Zucarini of the 'pirates of the Caribbean fame' underwater director of photography, the pop diva Kylie Minogue and a host of stars including Sanjay Dutt, Akshay Kumar, Lara Dutta and Zayed Khan. It's simple lesson for the first time Director Anthony D Souza that the basic premise for a good movie is a solid script and not star power!In a preposterous statement Anthony D Souza said that it was necessary to restrict the film to less than two hours. But after having sat through the entire 117 minutes (minus the interval which was a relief) the movie could've been much shorter. I was actually bored towards the end of the movie. The movie is marred by an almost non existent script, weak dialogues, lack luster music and poor direction. The story is predictable from the beginning itself and therefore lacks the twists and turns that are absolutely imperative for an action packed thriller. Instead of being a roller coaster ride high on adrenaline and volatile circumstances, the movie is prosaic with a ridiculous climax. It is much too slow for a movie of its genre and does not push the viewers to the edge. Lara Dutta was probably the only factor which left the viewers gasping and asking for more!There is no doubt that the movie has its moments. The impressive underwater sequences (Pete Zucarini) especially the one where Sanjay Dutt and Akshay Kumar actually ride a shark will take your breath away. The lighting for the underwater sequences is spectacular and the over all look is chic. It also boasts of some exhilarating action sequences both on land and in water. The bike chase sequence is 'fast and furious' which pushes the viewers to the edge. Lara Dutta's sculptured body adorned by gorgeous bikinis has pushed the oomph meter to unprecedented levels and is a visual treat for all.Blue is set in the sun soaked beaches of Bahamas. Sagar (Sanjay Dutt), a simple guy and a polished deep sea diver befriends Aaraav (Akshay Kumar), a rich ambitious businessman who loves his women and a good life. Lara Dutta (Mona) plays Sagar's wife and his eye candy. A fat Sanjay Dutt is laughable as a sea diver but gives a good performance otherwise. Akshay Kumar looks uber cool with his grey goatee and a hot body. Zayed Khan's performance is ignorable and he just cannot emote for nuts. The high point of the film is definitely Lara Dutta who will now give the other actresses a run for their money post her memorable performance in Blue. She looks as fresh as the morning mist and adds panache to her bikini clad character and does not look vulgar at all.The dialogues are absolutely ridiculous and inarticulate. Lara Dutta in a tense moment exclaims amidst bullets and villains, ""why don't you talk and sort things out?"" Amazing isn't it! The dialogues are almost contemptible.The music surprisingly doesn't click at all. The much hyped Kylie Minogue number ""Chiggy Wiggy"" is disappointing. The other songs (that I cannot even remember vaguely) have forgettable melodies. The last song ""fiqrana"" does manage to stay in your head but can be easily replaced. Seems Mr. Rehman is too conscious of his new stature post Oscars and played it much too safe.The director Anthony D Souza must realize that making a good film is not about bulging budget or star power or putting fancy visuals on screen. A good film has its foundation strong on a solid script while the facade comprises of the above mentioned facets in the right combination. Blue could've been a defining moment in the history of bollywood but instead is a damp squid. ]"
785,"[Rustic, grainy look. Immense style. Everything else wannabe - story, acting, thriller. There isn't even an attempt to get us hooked. They try hard, really hard to get us curious. But it doesn't work. And most unfortunately, we get the feeling that they think they are succeeding and are feeling good about it. So you have a situation with 6 people who have lost their memories locked in a clanky, metallic setting. No one knows who's who, including their own selves. Now doesn't that strike odd? No? How about I tell you even after watching the whole movie, identities known and all, it wouldn't matter which one of the 6 was which character. The personalities are pretty similar to each other. Age no bar, sex no bar. Even if they were interchanged at will, your reaction would still be an uninvolved, ""oh ok, if you say so."" That is if you are bothered to react after having already spent a good 100 minutes on the film already.  Of course there's so much that could be done with this situation, especially with the memory loss angle. But, na-ah, not a wrinkle on your forehead it brings. You are least interested in who's done what to whom. And it's difficult to point out why that is. Maybe because of the narrative style chosen. I usually enjoy two threads running together especially when they are set apart in time. But here, it just doesn't do it. Whether it is the lackluster story that happened in the history or whether the current situation is an overkill of drama for such a lame story in the background, I don't know. Both in parts, maybe. The non-performances don't help the do either. They actually made Dia Mirza shriek. That's just not fair. She can carry herself off in an action role, the lady can also emote, why make her character a prop? The other long list of equal length roles are all plain plain. You got to give some marks for the choice of texture for the film. Whether it was how the movie was shot or it was done in post-production is of little concern to the audience and the impact it has on them. The effect is pretty cool. And that's it. You enjoy the first 10 minutes and then what? There's nothing else to watch out for. Finito.So, yet another nice concept goes down the drain. This time because there's nothing other than the concept to chug the film forward. Oh well, waiting for the Diwali releases already.]"
786,"[For no mere mortal can resist, the magic of Michael JacksonBefore I begin, I think it would be wise to state that the review is going to be a little biased, me being an ardent fan of Michael Jackson. This Is It is a film about what could have been. From March through his untimely and unexpected death in June, Michael Jackson and his crew were busy preparing for what would have been his comeback concerts (after 10 years) at London's O2 arena. What followed, in the approximate two hours of the movie, was a glimpse of what went on during those rehearsals. It would have amazed the audience had it really been it. This Is It is not a documentary. It is more about his music, his performance. There were fireworks, aerial dancers, majestic costumes, astonishing visual effects and incredible choreography all set to Michael's classics like ""Billie Jean"", ""Black or White"", ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" and ""Thriller"". It was very enlightening to see the young dancers he'd chosen to go on tour with him look into the camera with tears in their eyes and thank him and describe how he'd changed their worlds before they'd ever even met him. It made me wonder if they were interviewed after his death. The production notes said that the movie was made from over 100 hours of rehearsal footage and I doubt it because it appeared that those were rehearsals for a handful of different days, judging from Michael's clothes.  And I hope that it's true that Michael really was saving up his energy and voice for the actual concerts as he said in the movie, because even though he sounded and moved superbly for a 50-year-old, he looked tired and frail in some of the sequences. As the movie went deeper, so did the nostalgic feelings in me. I was just 9 years old when Michael had toured India as a part of HIStory world tour and I would be elated when MTV would become MJTV for some hours, playing only his numbers, as a part of the tour's promotion. ""They don't care about us"" evoked in me the breathtaking performance of the same number in Mumbai in 1997.  But throughout the melodious documentary, there was a melancholic, uneasy sentiment lurking. After wrecking my brains for long, it hit me. What was missing was the audience. We were all used to seeing Jackson's concerts with the spectators going wild in hysteria. Girls sobbing uncontrollably, people fainting. That used to be the magic, the madness of Michael Jackson's concerts. All that and more was absent in the rehearsal footages. And it made me feel sad. It somehow coupled with the fall of the artist over the years owing to his eccentricities and finally his death. ""This Is It"" facilitated a highly nostalgic farewell to the world of a glorious artiste. It was a splendid souvenir for genuine fans of the late king of pop. And I would be an optimist here and refuse to believe that this was created for purely monetary purposes. RIP, Michael.]"
787,"[You see Boman Irani in the horrendous get-up and you know the next two hours aren't going to be very bright. But then again, you are an ardent movie buff, right? No wonder you are reading the review of a Hindi film called Fruit and Nut or, like in my case, at the threshold of a theater playing it. Thus you are here with a sliver of hope, a faith in Boman Irani and Diya Mirza's choice of scripts. HA HA! You have been made into a nut case and that's about the only laugh there is related to the film. It can't be that bad, you think? Bald and wigged villain kidnaps beautiful damsel because he wants the map to a gutter underneath the state assembly building in Mumbai. Co-villain(?) joins in mid-way to achieve the same purpose, except that everyone changes their aims and objectives conveniently. Some because they are actually serving the purpose of protecting heritage against the big bad mall-ification of the city. Except that you are not interested a teeny-weeny bit. It is a madcap storyline that slapstick lovers relish. The point, they say, is in the chaos where the aim is to make the impossible possible - believable or not is another story. You want madcap? You got MADCAP!! By the ton and more. Everything, every single micro-element of the film is filled with nonsense. Each character is a caricatured caricature. Each movement on screen is an attempt to make the audience laugh at some character or the others' misfortune. Which translates to 'Oh, so not funny'. And the quintessential loudness of the genre adds to the pandemonium. There seems to be a satirical comment on the trends of urban life while also spoofing Hindi slapstick films. Only that can explain the above average absurdity and disconnect in the dialogues. Especially the lines given to Khandar (Mahesh Manjrekar). A lot of pun used but none with any connection to anything. Anyway in hindsight, it feels like a farfetched theory and me trying my best to find meaning in the chaos. Anyway, though I understand this is not my kind of humor, I doubt it has anything for the genre-buffs either. When 100 minutes get a bit too much to stay put in the seat, you know all has gone wrong. ]"
788,"[The whiff of the Arabian Sea. You smell it. The first few drops of rain on your sweating forehead. You sense them. The love that only a Mumbaikar can express for his city. You feel it. I'm getting all romantic on you. You dread it. But what do I do when I see two people just be so comfortable on screen - as characters and as actors. Not necessarily romantically in the ""more than friends"" sort-of a way. But romantically as two individuals who react and interact. So, you got that? The number of times ""romantic"" and its derivatives have been repeated so far should indicate that you, the young lads, should already be planning that dinner date after the perfect date movie. And chicks, go watch this flick. The older generation on the other hand could empathize with the parents in the film. Sid is a normal, college-going kid - neither the superstar of his college, nor the super-buffoon. Neither the teenage heartthrob nor the class dunce. He's carefree and proud of it. Aisha is serious and knows what she wants. Her practicality is not an exaggeration, nor is it understated - a regular, motivated girl. Their contrasts - evident. Their similarities - to be deciphered. The first sequence in the film tells you this film is going take its own time to develop and unfold. And by the last sequence you know there isn't much unfolding to be done (except t-shirts and kurtis). The story is half-a-line and yet I'm going to be feel hurt on behalf of the makers if the audience complained, ""there was no story!"" At times when the movie goes deeper, it doesn't need too many words to describe the story. And the more time I spent with Sid (Ranbir Kapoor) and Aisha (Konkona Sen Sharma), the more I wanted to know them. It felt better to see screen time being spent on the niceties of their relationship. It was good to see them grow closer to and fonder of each other. Aaawww...that's what friendships should be like. And then I was deprived of more. And I was hurt when one was oblivious to the other's emotions just to satisfy the hunger for drama. Whether it's the maker's hunger or the audience's - I do not know. But annoyed I was, to see the twosome that got me into their drawing room, throw me out by their out-of-character, ignorant behavior. Those two, who were candid, lucid and were supposed to be best of friends until a few minutes ago. Then there were the couple of side characters who were there just to throw in a punch. Anything to do with Karan Johar has to have some angle of parental love and associated dramatic moments. Whether or not they belong. And they do not belong here. Especially when you realize one of them has been caricatured just for that one punch line. The lines which were fine until then and later too. Smartly used by thinking and sensitive characters. And suddenly it's spoilt by one on-the-face line. While these individual characters didn't work, most of the interconnected relationships were well-developed with just a scene or two. But whatever bit the dialogue-writer lacked, was made up in the way the two protagonists were created. Of course, kudos to the two actors, one maturing, and one who looks like she was born with fully-developed acting skills. The maturing Ranbir Kapoor will, I guess, be the industry's first candidate for the puppy-look, innocent boy. And yet not boy-next door. I enjoyed bits of their performances more because of how up-close I saw their expressions. Similarly there is this whole list of things that add value due to their absence. And top on my list is the conscious decision of not having that pause, that moment of awkwardness between a boy and a girl because of that hug, that touch. Its handled delicately and with finesse. We were just getting used to a superficial attitude of making a film about the woman protagonist, but end up seeing the man claim glory. This one is equally Ranbir's and Konkona's. Yes, even though the title of the film contains the protagonist's name.For a long-long time I've been watching out for a Hindi romantic film where the story is about the lead pair. That's it. Their emotions, their turmoil and nothing else.  Love Aaj Kal was close and Wake Up Sid comes even closer. I guess some background noise is inevitable to satisfy our need-more-masala palettes. But, we are growing up as an audience and it's so heartening to see our masala-chef production houses walk hand-in-hand with us. Pleasures of a preview show, you get to see the cans being off-loaded]"
789,"[A few people complain that I take ""without giving the movie away"" too seriously and I should at least give a bit of the story outline. Here you go - an infidel husband is trying to hide his illicit affair from his wife who's keen on finding out more about the woman who is nagging her boyfriend to leave his wife who has hired her admirer to spy on her husband who has hired a man to pretend to be his girlfriend's boyfriend who is trying to escape from the girlfriend's ex-boyfriend. And I'm not making this up! I truly don't even know which pulled hair to begin with, for slapsticks like these. They take my frustration with ""brains out"" school of film-making to astounding new levels. How come? Because they take actors like Ranvir Shorey and throw them down the chute. Ok, can't complain about Govinda and Riteish Deshmukh because they have set themselves in that groove. Though they know and so do we, they can do much better comedy if they were given a chance to. But, charming Sushmita Sen - with or without the extra weight? She can act, most certainly better than this. Same goes for Lara Dutta.  I've always liked her for carrying of all kinds of attires in style. But the skin on display here is yuckety yuck!! And all she does is shriek, shriek louder and some more. And as if that weren't enough there's a sequence in the film when Govinda and Riteish Deshmukh adopt a female voice. And by definition women shriek, right? Right! So at one point there were 3 female shrieks on at once. Oh, the nightmare! Actually, I think most of the dubbing was heavily processed by the latest equipment available for editing. I refuse to believe any human could create so much noise so consistently for such a long time. And not so much as half a punch line in this never-ending circus. Not a single gag that could bring as much as a smirk out of you. I sound so petty trying to find faults in a film that might actually have felt offended if we liked something about it. Zilch content unless loud tight slaps, louder background music, moronic situations can make a non-negative contribution to content.The religiously inclined, please let the movie-watching audience know what ritual we need to conduct to send the Dhavan-Govinda combination to retirement. Please, please, please, oh mighty ones, please tell us...]"
790,"[This is a summer block buster; one of the many that Hollywood keeps dishing out in the fond hope that at least some if not one would set the cash registers ringing loudly. Having never seen any of the earlier films in the series, I looked forward to some hot road action and fisticuffs, but was tremendously disappointed.  This film is downright lame; as a summer action block buster it has the required hot gals, automotive action, and studly heroes, but all of it combines in such a limp fashion, that it becomes a drag. Of course, there are set piece action sequences; all but one have cars moving at hyper kinetic speeds. The film opens with one such set piece, which introduces the ""cool"" characters in the story. This sequence is very predictable and obvious in its outcome, and the CGI effects add nothing to it. When the film cuts from the CGI frame to the ""real"" one, the perspective changes in a very obvious manner, and the viewer immediately sees that ""real"" is much too slow. This kills whatever impact the sequence might have had. Action sequences are very hard to visualize and stage; they have to be created in such a manner that they look good on screen which is what really counts. This director badly needs some lessons, possibly he should take a tip or two from John Frankenheimer; take a look at that superbly executed car chase on narrow roads that Frankenheimer gave us in Ronin. The other car chase sequences are set in tunnels and there is one on the city roads too. The tunnel sequences also suffer from the CGI syndrome. Yes, there is a lot of fast editing, rapid cuts to revving speedometers, and loud sounds, but it just gives you a big, bad, headache. The best sequence of the lot is the illegal race held on the city streets, simply because the CGI seems to have been kept to a minimum, and one gets a feel of the speed and the last minute near misses. There is wonder of wonders, a chase on foot too, but it is done in a very half hearted manner.The director probably believed that he needed to keep things moving to engage the audience and not let them worry about the plot; so he keeps the story moving, keeps the camera moving, and keeps the cars moving too. This formula does not work when it comes to the ""emotional / bonding"" scenes between the characters. These scenes become so ponderous; thanks to the cliched dialogue and wooden acting, that they just sink like lead weights.Vin Diesel has as much acting ability as his pectorals, in fact they seem to speak for him most of the time. The rest of the cast is a motley mish mash of toned bodies wearing snazzy clothes, and as they have nothing much to do, they really do not matter. The villain of the piece looks like one of those stereotypical drug dealers that infest the streets of Los Angeles ( at least in Hollywood movies), all chains, rings, and flash. The bad boys really try hard to look bad, with buffed up bodies, tattoos, and obligatory snarls. The eye candy does not stay around long for one to have a really good lecherous look. The whole movie looks and feels like it has been recycled from shows on TV; MTV Grind and other police serials immediately come to mind. The FBI Agents, the villains, the heroes, are all so obviously copies of copies, that one experiences a sensation equivalent to that of eating pureed cardboard, while watching the film. Watch this film if you feel like a pubescent lad or are one, the rest need to find better things to do on a hot summer day.]"
791,"[Let's get the obvious complaint out of the way. What's you Rashee? is long, super-long, super-duper long. No. Just ""super-duper long"" wouldn't be enough. It needed that build-up, it's that long! AND despite that, it's not an outright bad film, but it keeps it from being an ""undoubtedly great"" one. Oh, well...Let' get the second-most obvious thing about the film. This time a sure positive one. PRIYANKA CHOPRA. I'm usually more than okay with people not agreeing with my opinion of a film/performance/etc. But, I will be really surprised if there are more than meager handfuls who won't like Priyanka Chopra in this film. I had enough guys going siggggh and gals going wow (including me) every time she was on screen. Her performance(s) were brilliant one charming character after another. The third-most...Gotchya! You didn't think I was giving you a list of top 12 things about What's your rashee?, were you? But if I were to do that I'd guarantee, each paragraph sounded and talked about different things. Which is not what the 12 Priyanka characters do here. Yes, almost each of the 12 characters is charming, and a couple of them are very different from the norm. But the rest follow a format. There's something they want their groom-to-be or not-to-be to know and each Priyanka's 10 minutes of screen-time revolves around that issue. And this is extremely interesting for the first few times and obviously tiring after that. And the two that are different are too exaggerated to be true. Which is pretty much true of the entire story-line too. But the basic premise has been forgiven since we are already there to watch the film, right? And despite that we are asked for more. We have to accept the dad's selfishness and the brother's foolishness, the silly pundit and weird uncle, the prop sister-in-law and the I'm-here-to-lengthen-the-film aunt. Ooops! I almost forgot Harman Baweja. I surprise myself when I want to say, I think this guy can do well. He needs a chance where he's not over-shadowed by his star co-star. But, this one is all about the woman, right? Wrong. My issue with these so-called women-oriented films is also that they are well ""so-called"". While each one of the characters is today's girl with a mind of her own, it looks superficial. Because, she's still out for the man's support in needing what she wants and each one's approach is convoluted. And if there was ever a ""throw me around from one guy to the other, how do I care which man I want to get married to"", this is the one. Wait for the climax to react to this comment. This is what the writer's thinking process looks like. ""Yo! Priyanka Chopra is one helluva actor. She needs a film that revolves under her character."" . . . ""But, we don't know how to write women-centric stories. Damn! That too for someone with a star stature."" . . . ""Let's go through options that we can explore. 7 days of the week, naah - sounds ridiculous. 31 days of the month - way too many. So 365 days a year is out of the question....hmmm..."". .  Research - research - research  (am I giving too much credit? Well, the same man made the supposedly extensively researched Jodhaa Akbar, didn't he? Anyway... . . ""Hey, look here's this Gujrati novel Kimball Ravenswood by Madhu Rye. Yay! Jackpot And they made a TV series out of the same theme and it was pretty popular, remember? Mr. Yogi? "". . . ""Done, then! Since we've to get Priyanka to act real well, and she'll sell. The director can leave the rest of the cast to do their own thing, snort, fart, smile, whine, whatever. And he can focus on just the lady."" . . . ""Hey, wait! 12 girls one after the other without a break will become monotonous. Let's throw in a couple of side-stories. Which ones? Don't matter. Say a Don theme and an extra-marital affair theme. It'll just break the flow for a bit. Doesn't sound good? I said ""Don't matter!!"" It don't matter even if we don't give them a closure. You just watch..."". . . ""What else? It's masala no? We need songs. How many? Of course 12! Can't have any less, what if any one of Bhavna, Hansa, Anjali, Chandrika, Sanjana, etc, etc, etc feel bad? Can't risk that!"" And so we have what we have. An extremely mediocre product if it were not for Ms. Piggy Chops. True, the songs are nice, very well-picturized and different too. But after the 3rd one it gets a little blah! And when there are so many, songs with lip-sync involved they sound repetitious too. Gone are the days Mr. Gowariker when the Hindi film audience thought found their money's worth only if the film touched the 180-minute mark. Rest assured we, the audience, won't think any less of you if your movie doesn't move the average run-time of films around the world by a notch. Yet, it's not boring. So, viewers will be better equipped to handle its length at home with the luxury of the ""fast forward"" switch at their disposal for the non-Priyanka parts, of course. Oh yeah and the opening credits are one of the best I've seen in Hindi films!]"
792,"[The poster says it loud and clear, Rani Mukherjee is going to dress as a man to play cricket. Cricket is after all a gentleman's game. Watching this film made me think a lot about the phrase ""had its heart in the right place."" And then I wonder if crores of Rupees and the writing muscle that Yash Raj is capable of mustering cannot have the art in the right place, what good is the heart doing? And by the way, such hypocricy! Rani Mukherjee definitely has a bigger role than Shahid Kapoor, but Shahid gets first billing. The audience has outgrown Punjab, its lush green, mustard fields, the ""chak de phatte""s, and the ""Ik Omkar""s. It's sad that the maker's heart is still trying to juice the last drop out of them. Don't they want a change of scenery? It's been what? At least over 10 years already. Oh, and if that weren't enough, there's a bhangra beat in the background music - CONSTANTLY! Except in the songs, where it doesn't stay in the background. Oh, and don't even get me started on the jingoistic flavor added to most characters - who are half-dimensional in the first place. ""England"" - bad, ""Indian"" - super good. No texture, no flavor to that line of thought at all. Actually, you can't blame them for not experimenting though. It takes a fair amount of creativity to conjure a couple with Shahid Kapoor and Rani Mukerjee in it. While there was dismay guided towards this aspect of the film in dining room conversations, I was very curious to see how it worked out. And the verdict here is Shahid Kapoor looks awesome, has a cakewalk of a role for himself here where he has to alternate between romance and serious, almost play Shah Rukh of Chak De! India. Rani Mukherjee looks good too with that brilliant smile of hers, does well with her role without shrieking too much considering she's a Punjaban and all that. Oh and for those of you who were disgusted with the thought of her in a bikini, worry not, there isn't much to that negative-marketing gimmick. Together - they create zilch. You don't feel for them as a couple, you don't care if they are going to get together or not. A huge portion of the lack of ""chemistry"" is of course, the story and screenplays fault. There's no flow, no scenes with impact, no nothing. It like, ""a woman who aspires to be on the Indian cricket team. Hmmm...nice interesting. Let's make it into a film."" How she gets there is of no consequence. You need comedy, you need romance like you need salt and pepper. Add, mix and have the audience eat it. No matter if they are gag on it. This one from the house of Yash Raj Fairy Tales is just unacceptable. In the name of women empowerment, women are still mere props. Sure, having Rakhi Sawant and Sherlyn Chopra in the script as objects of lust, might've been a comment on the irony of women's status in Indian society, but it's in bad taste. And thus the film is not better than others which use the same premise. Oh boys, no need to rush to the theaters for this display of skin, the amount of cry-shy and drama-shama, I can guarantee won't be worth it.]"
793,"[When you are sitting in a multiplex and the other 559 people in the theater are whistling away to glory at each movement of the star in the film, especially the male one, you know the film's target audience. And this was not restricted to the first few minutes of the film, it continued at regular intervals through to the end. So, the Salman-followers can stop reading here and head for the theater, it's waiting to echo with your whistles.For the rest of us lesser-mortals, there ain't much going on there. It's the gang war routine. One kills the other kills the third and so on. And a couple of turns along the way. The story is as random, unbelievable and a crazy as one could expect. Yet, the dialogues can keep you going for a while, there are some really funny lines here and there.Salman Khan has his style accompanied by the one-expression-says-it-all expression. Of course, slo-mo entries add to the spunk, as if there was any lacking. Then there's Ayesha Takia trying to cope with the speed of the film. I don't know what it is with her or maybe her image - she just doesn't fit in the typical masala role. Not to mention her wardrobe reminds me of the weird stuff doing the rounds in the 90s. And despite this, she does look really good over and above her warmth in some scenes. That one I'd give full credit to the extra layers of makeup.Also the lady can't dance. I actually felt bad for her. She was hardly ever dancing WITH Salman in the same frame. The sequence cut to her doing some simple steps every once in a while. Fair enough, not every actor need to know how to do Prabhu Deva steps. But if they can, its sheer pleasure to watch them. I was in awe of Salman and the choreographer while the first song was playing. Pure delight. Then there's the romantic thread. It has a certain quality about it, but since it doesn't go too deep, you couldn't care too much for either forming in the pair or the pair as an entity. And I guess that's not the intention either. Wanted is merry at the surface, then why would it want to go deeper?There must have been a swearing in ceremony for the cast and crew - ""I swear on the XXX, I shall not take myself seriously."" I think a similar clause applies when you buy your ticket. Me? Well, I'm not star-crazy, so I wouldn't understand the mania. But it was fun watching what people enjoy.]"
794,"[Most underworld-crime based films more or less have to circle around the ""vanity of vengeance"". With an audience that mostly doesn't belong to the world from where the characters of the film come, the story writers pretty much don't have a choice. And yet, through this situation the writers here have made the going as interesting as possible. Building characters along the way. Creating situations for unrest at regular intervals. The pre-requisite for a crime-based action film is a swift pace and that is one thing Baabarr doesn't lack. There's always something happening and one situation leads to another in a clean and clear flow. And so is the flow of the ""boom-dishum-bang-dhickyau"". The gun-mania just won't take a rest. As if the little boy just found a new toy. I'm not easily disturbed by violence, but Baabarr in Hindi cinema takes it to a new level. There was one scene in which I actually felt sick in my stomach. And what can I say you can count the number of non-violent scenes on your fingers. And even in those scenes the dialogue is about the violence that took place or was going to take place. Yet, it's not like the characters haven't been worked upon. Each type of characters have traits that stay consistent and comply with the boundaries set for them. Thus adding to the believability. They were given decent dialogues too. Though all characters, most of the time, have to either scare or get scared, there's not much wrong with the acting department. Except for maybe Mithun Chakroborty who just can't seem to keep the actor's style out of the character. Also the grainy texture adds to the ""realistic"" feel of the film. The handheld, jerky camera is put to use almost continuously, but there is chaos and tension throughout the movie too. One refreshing aspect is that the backdrop is neither Mumbai nor Hindi cinema's favorite Punjab. They've also tucked in tributes to presumed inspirations like The Godfather and Satya. But, it would be only a shock if they didn't do that. We see 5, maybe even 10 films, based on some underworld concept every year. The storyline can only be so much different. The only basis for watching one and not another could be something different tried in the build-up towards the climax. Baabar has a couple of vexing situations but that's about it. And besides the excessive gore this isn't much of a variant from other crime-related fields.]"
795,"[Munnabhai MBBS, Patch Adams, Anand are a few of the films that come to mind within the first few minutes of Vaada Raha. Ok, with a few changes here and there. And they don't use exactly the same tricks. But the deviation seems more like a formality.The first change is of course having a little boy as one of the protagonists. Which could have worked had he not been talking and thinking like an adult. I can imagine that a character his age, who's already going through a bad patch in life, would become a little too philosophical for his age. But seeing him use the same cliched language as oldies with no creativity would, made me do just one thing - cringe.Given that, Dwij Yadav who plays the little boy, carries his cute self through the ups and downs of his days with aimless Dr. Duke (Bobby Deol). Unfortunately, doesn't look like he has learnt more about acting in this film. He's just done what he has done so far. This is the best I've seen Bobby Deol act. Yeah, it's not in a mean way that I say this. He actually emotes his anger and helplessness. Once that is done the rest is a cakewalk. More or less Nanhe Jaisalmer's team of cast and crew don't quite get us involved in vaada raha. Neither the adults nor the kids make us love or hate them. They are just going through the motions and so are you expected to do the drill as the audience - go, watch emotionlessly, get-up, go.]"
796,"[Just seeing Amol Palekar and Sharmila Tagore on a hoarding together is enough to make you want to give this one a try. Samaantar is a quite, serene experience. It puts on screen the struggle between a responsible individual and his/her personal aspirations. However, contrary to your expectations, there are no intense debates to match the intense looks on the lead pair's faces on the promo material. A couple of very interesting points are raised about romance and life-death. But, despite the arc in the story the narration seems flat. One of the huge compromises the story had to make was to justify the lead pair's feelings for each other because of the sacrifices they made in their youth. People, irrespective of age, have a right to love and have their feelings reciprocated. Why did they need a background of huge responsibilities? And despite the forceful filling in of the quiet with backstory, something's missing.It couldn't be in the acting zone. Sharmila Tagore's quite composition as Shama communicates much more than the verbose Amol Palekar's Keshav. Each perfect in their place. These two get you completely involved. Amazing since the man has come back to acting after 30 years. And the lady is one of the most charming and gracefully aging beauties.The missing bit could be because of the slow pace of the film, but there are some very unnatural and unexplained transitions in some of the side characters too. Also there's a very dissatisfied feeling at the end of the film. Maybe there was something a lot deeper that could have been conveyed but didn't. Yet, for the really inclined some of the performances might be worth the watch.  ]"
797,"[Once upon a time, there was a little village city called Had-bahedi. The people there were content with what they had, despite knowing the world outside has a lot more conveniences. They were always happy to take when it's given without asking for anything. And then the world outside enters to impose itself on Had-bahedi. Yes, Chintuji is a fairy tale. And that by definition makes it imaginary. The writer is asking us to enter his make-believe world and think, ""exactly what will it take for this to be the real world"". Nice thought. But can't be taken forward given the complexities of the real world and their over-simplification for the sake of making it into a film. There isn't much you can comment about plausibility of plot points when the whole concept is intentionally unlikely to happen. The actors are meant to behave like they were in a street play. They are very purposefully loud and exaggeratedly comic.  Sure, the actors are a bit of a saving grace. Very few can pull of being adorable while being arrogant like Rishi Kapoor. Priyanshu looks sincere as he should be. The rest are all just vague caricatures that represent Had-bahedi.What remains then is the way the plot is carried out and to a certain extent the strength of the dialogues. Both are more or less mediocre. There are jumpy cuts, predictable situations and drama that is carried out way too long. The dialogues are wannabe non-preachy. Like a bolt of lightning a character asks an insightful question, realization strikes the questionee, and immediate transformation from haughty to charming happens.Ultimately fairy tales unless fairly complicated make for good stories for children. But, since Chintuji is about corruption, politics, egos, etc it isn't kid-material either. And it is fairly simplistic too. So other than a quiet ""well-tried"" applause, there ain't much we can give it.]"
798,"[Fox is the writer-director's angst against unethical lawyers and could extend to any profession that is meant to help the common man but is most likely used to save the minority - rich. An awesome concept that could lead to a social awakening and all that jazz, but that's not the intention here. It saves us the lectures and turns it into a story which unfortunately is far-fetched and leaves some important questions unanswered. While Fox has one of the best cliffhangers at interval, the film is still largely predictable. And that is a little because of the way it's written and more because of the costumes, make-up, background music, camerawork, etc. And that is a huge bummer. There are some parts of the writing which work, like the going is not easy for the protagonists. They are as flabbergasted by the turn of events as the audience and trying whatever they can. But, it also has the usual lapses in character sketches where a smart character very conveniently turns naive.  Arjun Rampal (Arjun Kapoor) plays a self-absorbed lawyer. Though Kapoor's dilemma in the beginning comes a little too quick, Rampal convincingly looks both agitated and at peace when Kapoor needs to be. There's nothing very new for Sunny Deol (Crime Branch officer, Yashwant Deshmukh) to do, so he goes through the drill mustering up all the interest he can. Sagarika Ghatge (Arjun's girlfriend, Urvashi) and Udita Goswami (a leading publisher, Sophie) have token roles and are made to arrive and depart from the screen at will. That both Sophie and Urvashi are required to wear as revealing clothes as possible irrespective of whether they are at work or in a police station, tells us why they are in this script.Sure, Fox is not completely smart or well-thought out, but a murder suspense that doesn't have money and 100% revenge as the killer's motivation deserves some plus points. ]"
799,"[A mega-bomb blast is hatched in the heart of Mumbai. There are jihadis involved. And such a serious issue is completely ripped apart with laughter from the audiences. That is exactly how lightly this unlikely subject of terrorism is dealt with in Aage Se Right. The title would be meaningless without its logo. A straight run into a no-entry lane is what this film is all about. To start off, there's a terrorist (Kay Kay Menon) and a cop (Shreyas Talpade) both of whom are the least suitable in their professions. It's a spoof from the first few sequences. You can sense something is off from the darkest possible ambience created in the first scene. My usual complaint with spoofs is that in the name of being satirical they tend to do the same things that they are spoofing, only more exaggeratedly. Both the writer and director refrain from doing that and that a HUGE bonus for the audience. Of course, they haven't been able to avoid it completely. To start with a few jokes are predictable. Then, stereotyping of people from various regions of the country has been done ad nauseam in Hindi films. There are coincidences that are not anywhere close to reality in Mumbai. Also, there's this film set whose crew is the most annoying. Add to this flashback, character transitions, token roles to women, some bad animation, and a cliched climax - could be all in the name of satire, but it didn't entertain nor did it make a point. There's the customary joke on the targe of every third film these days - media - it receives another thrashing in the same old way. Enter creative dialogues. Aage Se Right has the most hilarious lines I've heard in a real long time. A couple of them made me burst out into laughter and the rest of the time I had a wide grin across my face. The situations added to the scope for dialogues. The entire idea of having a Mumbai underworld Don teach a pure Urdu speaker the Mumbaiya dialect of Hindi under the name of ""correct"" language was hilarious and didn't get tiring till the end. And add to this the little things happening in the ambience - sign boards, costumes, mobile phone ring tones colors used - all that contribute to the humorous vein. The contrast between rough and gruff Mumbaiya and the ultra-clean albeit outdated soft Urdu is unmistakable. The comparison of how the underworld organizes itself with that of the corporate world is comic. I also enjoyed the analogy of Dinkar Waghmare's (Shreyas Talpade's) character to superheroes. It's always fun to see Kay Kay Menon switch to comedy in an otherwise serious role. But in this one, he is a complete laugh riot. And that too completely utilizing his perfect diction. Can you miss the character's frame of mind with an actor like Kay Kay. Cool clown, Shreyas Talpade has timed his lines perfectly. Though the script requires him to be a little loud, he manages to annoy only when the co-character in the frame needs to be annoyed. The balancing might have been a tough one. A couple of other character actors have done well too, but the rest is just going through the drill.It's been a while since I've enjoyed a spoof so much. The constant stream of funny quips and Kay Kay Menon were the main contributors. It is a good weekend watch, not necessarily a rush to the theaters for the not so keen but certainly a cool DVD watch.]"
800,"[Capitalism vs. communism, Dalit vs. Brahmins, Rich vs. poor, man vs. woman, North vs. South, fatalism vs. cynicism vs. self-believer, good vs. evil vs. not-so-good - and but ofcourse, Hinduism vs Islam vs. secularism. Yeh Mera India deals with all these concepts and more in its 130 minute run and does it fairly too. It employs some twenty odd characters and twines their lives together to make a believable albeit idealist picture of one city in this country. It's a very enjoyable collage of characters that make up Indian urban life - from the middle-aged woman watching repeats of soap operas, to young career-minded woman aspiring to get away from Indian way of life. The creepy, cheesy bastard to the activist who wants a change in the establishment and soon. Among all the contradictions you see the irony when a doctor becomes the creator of death and when a judge is asked to bribe, or asked to go to court. While presenting this set of more-or-less realistic characters, Ye Mera India (YMI) has in its milieu - education, unemployment, underworld, judiciary, the naxalite movement, impact of jihad training on little minds, the bane of being a good-looking woman, TV TRP's dominating art - a comment on both the industry and the taste of what the audience wants. A setting where a person might not have money but he sure does have a mobile. A city that ain't for the simpletons. A city which supposedly thrives on lack of civic sense - from spitting on public property to lane cutting to road rage. The travel of farm-owner to becoming a suspect for robbery and faces assassination of her character. And in its midst comparing communism to religion. Sure, some of the attitudes on display might be exaggerated - both good and bad. And there's a phase where the sorry gets exasperatingly sorrier. And the usual transitions in characters that are just too good to be true. Then, there's the preacher-teacher going around showing everyone THE right path. While it works at times, it happens too often and unfortunately becomes unintentionally funny. Also the climax is a bit too difficult to digest and takes a lot away from the beauty of the film thus far. And yet it succeeds in making a point. As the mirror is held to various characters, the part of the audience that behaves like the character, sees its image on screen. Also when the intended-to-be-disgusting disgusts, you know all departments have worked completely and in sync. This is accompanies throughout with smart dialogues. And despite the extensive use of abusive language, it adds to the ambience rather and doesn't one look out-of-place. The narrator in the form of a voiceover recites insightful poetry. Though it might be a tad overdone in the first half.  None of this would have worked had it not been for the wonderful choice of cast. And that almost each one of them stood up to their task. And we are reminded that Rajpal Yadav can give a subtle performance if he's allowed to. A pleasant surprise, a decent eye-opener to the subtler hypocrisy in society Yeh Mera India should certainly be on your ""too watch"" list. If not the theaters, at the very least when its out on DVD.]"
801,"[A film where the main characters find a load of cash has huge potential for characters and their reaction to the windfall. Even if you have the standard one good guy who wants nothing to do with it, another few that are outright criminal in their intent, a couple in-betweens, there is enough scope to make it an intense character fight. But, Toss takes the other route, making itself a full-fledged whodunit thriller. Fair enough. But it outlives its welcome by creating suspicion for each character. While it's interesting for a bit, it gets tiring and you want it to be done with. Toss is a depiction of the darkest side of humans. Enter money matters and everything else goes for a toss - love, friendship, honesty. And selfishness takes over within a blink of the eye. Perfectly humane characters can turn into cold-blooded murderers of the worst kind - the kind who can kill friends without remorse. To add to the darkness there are sudden spurts of comedy which take away from the thrill achieved so far. Maybe it happens, but there isn't enough development for it to be convincing. Also, even if there is an innate beauty in leaving questions unanswered, here they feel more like a lapse in writing than an intentional part of the art. Also films that have all villains and no heroes or token heroes leave you no one to care for. As if this display is not enough there's a display of kids getting a kick out of torturing other humans. That might be the way nature has made us but sensitivity is completely missing here. So, if the thrills get cumbersome and the characters aren't appealing what is the viewer left with? Performances, right? Out of the lot, Prashant Raj seemed to be the only one who took his job seriously. Even if the dubbing is totally off for the women, it is only one of the contributing factors for the out-and-out shoddy job done by them all. However it is nice to see Sushant Singh as a diffident character. Despite a general lack of talent in the acting department, it is commendable that none of the characters are loud. Except of course, Rajpal Yadav who spoils the little decorum with his quirkiness for his bit-role. The wannabe cool shots, especially the close-ups of random objects which are meant to inspire fear, reminded me of RGV's Phoonk. Also, though the background music was abrupt at many places, there are spots where the strings used sound different and nice. But the consistent music is a bit overwhelming. Not to mention that the Bhangra song was out of place and not a pleasure to listen to. It looked like an opportunity missed for what could have been an edge-of-the-seat noir depiction of us as people. The main culprit, despite the lack of attention to writing, is the length. You could take this one on when you have a remote to your aide.]"
802,"[It's interesting that despite having the run-of-the-mill two-brothers-differ-in-attitude storyline, Kisaan manages to spring a couple of surprises. Despite having the masala elements, it manages to bring in a couple of tragedies. A family is torn apart by the distance between the village and the city. Physical, emotional, financial, etc. Education within agricultural background. But, the silly jokes stereotyping the city-citizens' arrogance and the villagers' ignorance get tiring. One brother's naivete and the other brother's love for violence gets a bit too convenient to aid in wrapping up the film. Letting misunderstandings brew, being blind to manipulation is one's forte. And the other and his enemy just like snapping off anyone who offends them. And yet there are some interesting turns. But again, the climax is extremely handy. Very simplistic. Ultra-hurried.  None of the characters are complex enough to require any great performance from anyone. So, from Jackie Shroff to the Khan brothers to Dia Mirza they all just run through the mechanics. Whether or not any of them are capable or not, is another question all together. And yet amongst three men in the lead roles, Dia Mirza's character Priya has a role of some minimal substance. But everything from this to the main plot seems very superficial and cursory. I cannot leave this place without mentioning how annoying the background music was. People, just because it's Punjab you don't need a few hundred extra dholak-wallas in the orchestra! It's a debate. Whether to applaud the unpredictability they've attempted and partially succeeded at. Or to hate the predictability when they do the cliches. Had they done something more spectacular with the unexpected turn of events, it might have been worth a try. And since that's missing, there isn't anything I can ask you to look forward to.]"
803,"[So, there's cool-dude Rajnikantha. And there are people who absolutely love the route his sunglasses or cigarette take to get to their destinations. Among these are people who can't stop going gaga over his invincibility. Sample this. Me? I find the silliness funny. The sunglass-cigarette routine make me smile about 3 times. But then, it gets repetitive and thus predictable and ultimately boring. Exactly what happens in Quickgun Murugun which spoofs Rajni.Our man, Quickgun Murugun - the cowboy, the protector of the cows - is out to do his job, viz, protect cows from the fanatic non-vegetarian, Rice Plate Reddy. To fulfill his duty he convinces the officers of the other world to send him back to this world. And so on and so forth.Sounds outrageous and out-of-the-world hilarious. But it ain't that ROFLarious. There isn't much comment you can make about such films, right? There's the usual ricocheting bullets and super-power-like action. Acting is intentionally over-the-top and overtly melodramatic - by one and all - okay except maybe the cameo by Vinay Pathak. So is the direction, especially in terms of the long pauses to enhance the already outlived-its-stay drama. Or even the emotional drama that punctuates the flow of the film, the exaggeration of everything in every frame. But, it's a spoof, so it's all obviously deliberate and supposedly necessary, what can you say? Certainly you are not allowed to complain. However, there are some bits and pieces that work. These make you smile and occasionally that smile grows wider. Each character's name is a cackle each. Also a lot of the smiles are hidden in the background, in the art-work, some reference that'll make you sneer at both - the joke and your smartness because you noticed it. Another bit I completely enjoyed is the background score. It's creative and it's funny. There's one bit where a western-film theme music is playing on a flute. Nice! There is also this comment on how super-heroes and God-like humans are necessary to get rid of the filth in the society today. A good vs. evil war is more obviously portrayed as a dev vs. daanav (God vs. Satan) war. What's more? Like Lord Krishna our man has more than one love interests. There are lot of tiny comments tucked in too. Like the irony that the anti-vegetarian demons have to use different vegetables as weapons. Celebrities used to advertise commodities, an Indian's love for mother's cooking, a mother's pride on how well she cooks, etc. But the novelty wears off. With each of the things I liked and found funny, it was so only for the first couple of times. The third repetition onwards it became boring. So much so that one and a half hour seems too long to sit there for this.]"
804,"[For some reason, the Western as a Genre of film making has all but vanished from our screens (the writer has his views on the subject, but that would constitute a different article!). The Western was the quintessential embodiment of the Great American myth; the promise of the New Land, the wide open Frontier where a man could become rich irrespective of his class and background, and of Men who in wild and brutal times, stood for justice and fair play that was the heart of the American dream. They featured the lone Hero, who stood up for truth and honour and acted with courage when required. The Western genre has been used as an allegory (High Noon - 1952) and also as an ode to the Romantic outlaws who had to give way in the face of commerce and early capitalism (Sergio Leone's all time classic, How the West was Won, and Sam Peckinpah's spectacularly bloody The Wild Bunch). Clint Eastwood gave the genre another twist altogether in the 1990's with Unforgiven, a dirty unflinching look at the entire myth of the Western and the American Dream. And now after years, we have 3.10 to Yuma. Director James Mangold has helmed several films before, but never a Western.  Indian viewers might remember Identity, a complex murder mystery, which was on show around five years ago.  Let me state right at the outset, this film is not an action film. If as a viewer you are interested in chases and gunfights, well, then this film is not for you. This is not to say that there is no action; in fact it has a first rate stagecoach chase, quite a few gunfights, and a great climax featuring lots and lots of guns and shooters. But the difference is that the action is not meant to entertain and elicit ""oohs and aahs"", but is instead used to give us insights into the possible personalities of the characters. This requires a well forged screenplay which pays attention to small nuances to delineate characters and also an accomplished director, and it is here that both Mr. Mangold and the writers distinguish themselves.The screenplay works wonderfully to give us a whole bunch of people whom we remember long after the film is over. A ruthless and yet quite honest criminal who is also a charmer when it comes to women, a war veteran rancher deep in debt, a veterinarian who cannot shoot, a grizzled bounty hunter on contract, a trigger happy young outlaw, the young but somewhat fearful railroad man, an adolescent boy struggling to be a man; they somehow seem so real and present, that you empathise deeply with them and their circumstances. The director has followed one of the truisms of cinema, about cinema being all about reaction rather than action, and he gives us tight close ups of the characters' faces, as contrasted to the panoramic country that they are traveling in. The dialogue is laconic and terse, and weaves in themes of justice and morality. The film does not sing hosannas to the American dream; instead it very subtly shows us the hypocrisy, the exploitation, and the greed that made America what it is today. There is a sequence where we are shown Chinese laborers building railroad tunnels, cheap labour that was brought to America to build most of its railroad and also work the mines. In a passing shot we see an encounter between the young adolescent white boy and a Chinese laborer of nearly the same age, and the reaction on their faces says it all, about race and class.  We also come to understand that law and legal rights are almost always subordinate to economic interests. Russell Crowe is outstanding as the bad guy Ben Wade, his puffy face and the lines around his eyes speak volumes about his dissolute, yet intelligent personality. Christian Bale's hard planed face is something that is not easy to forget either; his misery and anguish come through in his muttered dialogues and in the set of his jaw. The film ends in a bloody and brutal climax which is well staged and leaves us feeling vindicated, in a manner that we really do not understand. Again here the director shows his class, the final interactions between the outlaw and the rancher as well as the closing scenes, weave in the earlier themes and bring them to a most satisfying resolution. The end remains true to the genre; about how Men must make their stand irrespective of how the bullets may fly and what it means to be a Hero. Thank God for the Bollywood multiplex brouhaha, let us have more such films please. PS And for all those who love pulp Western novels and films and the guns that feature in them, this movie has the works, the Spencer carbine, Colt revolvers, Remington sawed off shotguns, and the Gatling.]"
805,"[Nearly a decade after Sam Mendes dissected suburban life in American Beauty; he is back with another intense examination of the same terrain. This time around the story centers on a young couple, the Wheelers, and their relationship. Revolutionary Road wastes no time on romance, but instead kicks off at a point where the young couple is staring at the end of their youth and the beginning of middle age. The script builds up beautifully; the opening sequence takes care of the romance, the second sequence establishes the nature of the relationship and suggests possible reasons that could jeopardize it, and the third sequence outlines and contrasts their individual lives in the present. It is from the third sequence onwards, that the film takes hold and from then on we just cannot let go. The film draws us in to the world of the Wheelers, their lives, their jobs, their friends, and their aspirations as well as anxieties. Each scene is marvelously set up; tiny details are fleshed out exquisitely, both in the acting, the dialogues, as well as the props used. One has to pay careful attention, as the minutiae are extremely important and provide the context in which the action takes place. The camera work is steady for the most part, except in the final sequences where it changes to hand held; a move which accentuates the air of unreality and disorientation that the characters possibly feel. The final sequence and track in leaves us with an extreme sense of unease. The acting is top notch, one forgets Dicaprio as a star, and identifies totally with him as Frank Wheeler and nothing else. In his earlier films like The Departed and The Gangs of New York, it was very difficult to go beyond his good looks. Here, his mouth and his eyes combine to turn in a most natural performance. Kate Winslet is superb too, we see her harried, frustrated, loving, hating, and dreaming. The supporting cast seems to be part of the landscape; they blend in so admirably, their acting so nuanced, that one is totally caught up in the illusion. Michael Shannon as John Givings, David Harbour as Shep Campbell, Kathy Bates as Helen Givings, and Dylan Baker as Jack Ordway, not only act, but their roles, however brief, are critical to the story. The background score is stupendous, all muted piano, strings, and synthesizer. The score beautifully accentuates the emotions of the characters and in the climax builds a persistent note of dread and despair. The film is relentless: it probes every nerve, however painful, scrutinizes myths of love and marriage, sifts through the debris of human hopes and aspirations, and hurtles to an inexorable climax.  It is dogged and ferocious at turns. The viewer is pinned to his seat, squirms and is jolted, as he / she sees lie after lie exposed. Sam Mendes has given us a fine film, a film that seems more real than life itself. Where American Beauty suggested hopes of redemption of a kind, Revolutionary Road makes no such promises. It is an uncompromising and unyielding look at a relationship and situates it within the larger context of a society and its mores. The film is not particularly kind to men; it demolishes most of the fables that men have created with respect to work, love, and family. One feels exhausted after watching it, one pauses and hopes against hope that his or her life not be as shown, but alas, one knows better.]"
806,"[Paradise on earth or battlefield? Religion or Politics? Military or militants? Individualism or greater cause? Both, both, both and both. And yes Sikandar deals with all of them. Or at least tries to. Only very deft hands can do justice to the complexities these issues involve without oversimplifying it. And oversimplify this film does. That too with a lot of loopholes. Despite all of this though the film is a decent overall look at what's happening up there because, like it's said, it has its heart in the right place. Kashmir is in turmoil. We all know that. How many times do we think of the people who live there? People like you and me. What happens to the kids growing up there when they are orphaned - by our soldiers or the jehadis - collateral damage of their cause? What about the collateral damage caused to the psyche of the people living - for whom this is a way of life? How altruistic are the harbingers of peace or the messengers of God? Piyush Jha, the writer, started with a very nice and acceptable connect-the-dot game. In the overall picture, the dots, all the characters are in place - the common man, the opportunist jehadi, the calculating military, the ""impartial"" religious leaders, the crookedly ambitious politician and back to the common man. We know the dilemma or the singular aim faced by each one given his/her situation. And you are sensitized or not to their situation. But unfortunately, the links connecting them has way too many breaks, especially as the film progresses. Things are handed in too easily or are completely indigestible. Yet there are many fascinating facets. The vulnerability and pettiness of the directionless youth and how easily influenced they can be. The tyranny of the people who think they are working for a larger purpose but are doing nothing but serving their personal aspirations. And not just the politicians, all of us, including Sikandar are self-centered and self-preservation is our only goal. Guns belong to soldiers and that's where they should be. A man denies a girl her tears - does his capacity for cruelty need any more illustration? And even the glaring, on-the-face climax which leaves the future of this beautiful part of the world in the hands of the same youth - who have grown with their experiences in the last few weeks, who might have matured beyond their age due to the situation the adults around put them in. The problem is other than the overall picture, there isn't much going right in Sikandar. Apart from being full of holes, the story is pretty much predictable. Though it's difficult to say if it was the director's intention to cue the audience in. Because a lot of the acting gives away the ensuing ""twist"". Parzaan Dastur playing the lead doesn't seems to have carried on his dialogue delivery style from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. And Black's Ayesha Kapoor just about manages to convince us of her character, Nasreen. A lot of these issues have to do with the completely off-sync dubbing. I wouldn't be surprised if I were told that the actors didn't dub for themselves. Also, R. Madhavan and Sanjay Suri barely have a role to showcase any of the skills we know they have. No doubt, this is a low-budget film and needs to be applauded for shooting in Kashmir. I liked the times when the camera moved like a soft wave. But, there surely must have been more ways to capture her beauty than to take touristy shots at dawn and dusk. I can't but resist thinking, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy saying, ""itna paisa mein itnaich milega"" (Channel V Adage, this is all you'll get for the fee you're paying me). Just didn't believe the credits when I saw them. Also, the background music was nice but some-or-the-other tune playing for the full run-time got annoying. It felt like I wanted a time-out to enjoy some Kashmir in peace.Despite all its shortcomings, I'd still want you to watch Sikandar, maybe no one needs to rush to the theater but a fair watch nevertheless. Just to bring you that one inch closer to the (quoting Madhavan's character, Rao) heaven ""man shouldn't have touched"" albeit from the safety of our homes.]"
807,"[The first few sequences of the film are pretty dreadful. I was actually worried that a downplayed Baghban was in store for me. Older generation = all good. Younger generation = all bad. Soon enough that morphed into something completely different and yet it was predictable. How they managed that is something you have to see yourself. The problem is none of this was done interestingly.Dialogues were the most cliched and thus not even yawn-worthy. The situations are given ample time to establish the equation between various characters. But, again none of them with a great impact. Individually the characters though had very interesting nuances. The villainous ones had a shade of good that went naturally with their personality and vice versa. The prospect of watching Anupam Kher, especially when it's likely to be serious, is very exciting for me. But there's nothing special about his act here. Its neither a performance worth an applause nor would it receive negative feedback. Sharmila Tagore is her charming self. Divya Dutta took full advantage of the extra space afforded to her here and played the bitch to perfection. But ultimately over-dramatizes towards the end. Rajit Kapoor didn't have anyting exciting to convey the characters intentions were clear. The rest of the cast needs some serious acting lessons. A huge irritant was a song playing at random moments, sometimes back-to-back. The music was an ear-sore, they were picturized in the most awful fashion. The lyrics - at least the ones I could hear without awful music distracting me - were decent. The music and lyrics were two distinct entities. Usually in a 'different' concept, the climax is what makes or breaks the film. Here the cliffhanger at the interval just trashed the movie for me. It was so predictable and mundane that the audience was cursing itself for being in the theater. The bold climax didn't redeem the film. Despite characters behaving exactly as they were built so far. And that's a shame. Because it is in fact a huge step to defy prevalent social norms. And thus, yet another promising story-line becomes a martyr at the hands of an ambitious director. The one who wants to film a story that is close to his heart but finds himself obligated to stick to commercial norms of song-dance-drama routines. ]"
808,"[How ironic. A movie that makes a comment on the prevalent systems in the Hindi film industry gives us a complete dose of slapstick, cliches, glaring loopholes, songs that don't belong and the works. And this is despite making a few smart and snide remarks. It talks indirectly about audience's taste in films being dictated by the star of the day. About how a non-actor can reign ""Bollywood"". It talks about the way things work in the industry. That it takes a lot of struggle to make it big. That goodness or ingenuity is not necessarily awarded. But then there are unbelievable events like the entire population of a rundown building lends miraculous support to the protagonist. Or the lead lady who's a successful actress has no say in decisions regarding her personal life. Are these formula sub-plots a comment on commercial cinema or are they gaps in the script - we'll never know. Or is ""bollywood"" their excuse for making one patchy film? And despite these flaws there are some very interesting plot twists in the film. The kind that put the characters in dilemmas and conflicts that require extreme steps to be resolved. Shekhar (Akshaye Khanna) reaches a point where a decision that is pretty much out of his control is forced upon him. When he's not ready. A decision that pretty much makes it 'love of his life' vs. 'his career'. Manasi (Amrita Rao) faces two extreme types of people in her life. People who want to take every advantage of her affluent position and people who can't bare the thought of doing that. She is a good girl and yet she makes an extremely selfish move. All facets of the film industry which might also reflect on any other community are touched upon. From the naturally malicious to the converted cruel people. And then there are well-meaning people who try to play mentor but first take care of themselves. Such is life. And Short Kut captures it well. The lead actors do a decent job of portraying their characters too. Akshaye Khanna comes across as the righteous and egoistic, male chauvinist that Shekhar is. So far I've seen Amrita Rao play non-glam roles. Seeing her skimpy clothes feels like seeing a child grow into a woman. Two old men lech at her offended me. But she came across as someone who can take care of herself. Exactly like Manasi. Arshad Warsi is the exact amount of annoying in his portrayal as the shallow, uncouth b@$!@&amp;*. I could have easily done without the parts where he gets too loud to be tolerable. Which reminds me of the unique sense of humor one needs to see Chunkey Pandey cast as an acting Guru! The rest of the side characters are best left alone. They are too garish and caricatured to be funny. They in fact make the film seem much longer than it actually is. Also the film drags quite a bit. Had the slapstick and drama been left out it would have been very good riddance to bad rubbish. And it would have saved a lot of stock, money, and time of both the makers and the audience. Imagine the man-hours that will be spent in watching all the extra ugly frills. For some the best short cut would be to skip the film. For others who care for interesting conflicts and characters might want to give it a shot. But a forward button might come in handy when the not-so-interesting parts come. They do come a bit too often. ]"
809,"[Sankat City - a metropolitan that's a metaphor for human nature. Each of us has a lot of evil in us but at the core there's goodness. And incidentally it's the metro and its environment that is known to make us the people we are. And yet the film starts of well and some time after midpoint loses the way, becomes repetitive, and boring. It also becomes a tad too loud. Also spoofing old Hindi films is done too often in the recent past that it doesn't impress. Some of the directorial decisions are impressive though. They took a huge risk by choosing the grainy texture that gives the feel of a film from the 70s-80s and it worked big time. It makes the film stand out from the glitzy, crisp images we are used to. It fascinated me through to the end of the film. A montage of interesting, weird characters is weaved together. It is fun to see the way through the labyrinth. Because weird becomes bizarre - yes it's possible. And in a very fun sort-of a way. Unfortunately, stretch it a little too long and you have lost me - which happens here in the last 30-45 minutes. But there are a few good performers to keep it sailing through. The casting of the lead actors was near perfect. Choose Kay Kay Menon for any role and he works, so no doubts there. Rimi Sen is Hindi films' best lady-crook. She has mastered the smirk, the know-it-all look, and the ""Damn! Why do I get confused? I'm a bad girl, why do I have these good-good feelings?"" expression. Another impressive performance was that of Dilip Prabhawalkar. Though exaggerated he did come across as the poor old man who needed to be taken care of. I'm a fence-sitter as far as Anupam Kher is concerned. I always look forward to his films but just can't handle it when he goes in the slapsticky mode. And here a huge chunk of his role was slapstick. The rest of the cast were too exaggerated and spoof-Bollywood types for me to enjoy them. That's the thing with Bollywood-parodies these days. With the intention of reminding us of yesteryears or Bolly's follies, they do exactly the same things that annoy in the actual films. And here's the circle that I'm tiring of. A typical comedy Hindi film is slapstick or a chain of implausible events. A spoof of that will have to be the same - only more exaggerated. So, imagine exaggeration being exaggerated. Doesn't make me laugh, doesn't make me clap. Yes, the concept is dark, comic and wacky. Full points to that. I wish it was subtle and retained interest till the end too.]"
810,"[An auspicious red and golden cloth flies across the bright blue Los Angeles sky. It is intercut between shots of the source and the destination - Sim's (Kareena Kapoor's) purse on to Viraj's (Akshay Kumar's) face. Creativity of the 50s-90s reproduces itself in Kambakkht Ishq. What were they thinking? Sorry, ""thinking"" is way too big a word. Usually, even if it's a bad film, I end up saying, ""at least it put some money in the flow, good for the economy."" But, I cannot stop hurting at the crores and crores of Rupees drowning from the drain to the core of the earth. What is it that prompted the supposed top-of-the-line stars of the country to entertain this no-line (ouch...just can't make myself call it a plot) and expect the film-starved country to be entertained? Unless the definition of entertainment has changed to - slo-mo entries, cake fight at a wedding, slap-a-thing-slap-it-again, leching, disgusting innuendos, and so on and so forth. The loud-louder-loudest, loud-louder-loudest contest between Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor, Aftab Shivdasani, Amrita Arora, Jaaved Jaffrey, Kirron Kher and basically the entire cast is insufferable. Kirron Kher and Jaaved Jaffrey should now retire from this genre. For that matter Akshay and Kareena will do themselves AND US good too by not allowing such projects to find its way on the screen. Kareena looks good but she almost always does. So, what's the value-addition made by this particular set of makers? Having the stalwarts of Hindi films cameo for your film is passe. Hollywood is the new trend. So, we have what looks like stock-footage of Bruce Willis to Angelina Jolie attending a ""Stuntman's award ceremony"". Then we have Denise Richards, Sylvester Stallone and Brandon do small gigs. And just in case you miss them, or don't recognize them, their name is repeated at every appearance. So, much for creative dialogue. The creativity actually lie in giving credits - Pooja Batra was credited for ""acquiring foreign stars"". Wonder who ""acquired the Bollywood ones""?The lines were bad, the jokes were lousy and needless to say predictable. The overall film cannot be called obvious because before you say the word ""film"" you know how it's going to end. Little did I know that the ""establishing characters"" bit was going to go on for the next 2.5 hours! I was wondering if the constant comments between Akshay and Kareena about each other's IQ was actually a hint at the audience who was still watching the film after the first 10 minutes. More often than not, movies of this scale have good songs and choreography with an aesthetic sense. Not here. Music is typical Anu Malik stuff. The lyrics although are a bit more interesting than usual. I don't remember ever having remembered my mom so often while watching a film. The brain went into a rhythmic pattern of internally yelling ""MUMMMMY!!!"" every couple minutes. The monsoon has set in guys. Go watch the leaves caress each other in the cool air. Certainly beats the awkward Akshay-Kareena lip-locks lip-pecks.]"
811,"[Remember those family feuds whose existence depended on ""killing romance""? Boy king, Girl maid-servant. Boy Hindu, girl Muslim. Boy vegetarian, Girl meat-eater, Boy's family and girl's family are enemies, oh and how can I forget Boy poor, girl rich. We have a little bit of a mish-mash from some of these themes in Jashnn. Which ones? Does it really matter? It is written shoddily and doesn't do any justice to whatever charm these films had should be enough to keep you away from this one. The film pretty much ends where it starts except for the sudden transformation of characters. Losers as protagonists have to be really, really charming and the storyline around them intriguing to make the film watchable. While the modernized love story which does a sudden about turn as the climax closes in is not palatable at all. Neither Adhyayan Suman nor his character Akash are charming. We have to grant that Adhyayan covers a huge range of emotions. But, there is something about his personality that doesn't cut him as a lead actor. And he doesn't have that much extra talent to excuse the lack of killer looks to pull him through. Anjana Sukhani on the other hand is a mildly pleasant surprise. There are times when her dialogue delivery is flat. But there are these glimpses in which a single twitch on her face communicate what her character feels. Alas, they are very few and long distances lie in between. I would have been able to comment on Shahana Goswami's act, if her dispeakable wardrobe didn't distract throughout the film. Sure, she needed to have a slutty look, but was it necessary to dress her in the most hideous outfits that didn't flatter her at all. Also her body language matched more that of a roadside prostitute rather than her otherwise supposedly grand lifestyle - standing with legs wide apart don't go with plush flats and flat screens, etc. For a movie coming out of the Bhatt camp, Jashnn has non-hummable music and just about alright lyrics. None of them are very impressive and have no repeat value at all. After going through all of this, thinking back about the film, I understand that the direction could have been a lot worse. I can also imagine the look and feel being a lot less kitschy. But that wouldn't be enough for one to sit through a movie. Sleep through - maybe. At least I felt like I was just up after a good nap when the credits rolled, though I did watch the entire film.]"
812,"[One could easily get away with saying that Agyaat has no 'real' story. And they wouldn't be entirely wrong. The one-line description and the detailed description would pretty much be the same. But as the drama in the post-interval 45 minutes unfolds the film shows the struggle of a human being. A struggle between his natural instinct to become an animal for his survival and his persistence in trying to keep himself from turning into a beast. And this is what sets the film apart and keeps it from becoming one big yawn-fest. Also some of the jerks - the kind in a horror film that jolt up in your seat - are done pretty well. Of course, there are other times when all you see is the camera following the subject or being followed by the face of the subject. This though is used in limitation and saves the film from becoming a tiring watch. At last I found the use of nauseating camera angles in an RGV film justifiable. The spookiness he tries to create this time works at least in bits - more so in the second half. Pre-halfway the film is pretty much blah. Nothing much goes on in the story other than set-up of characters. Also there is enough evidence of RGV going bonkers in post-production, especially in the sound department. And yet I wanted the cackling in the audience to stop - I understand it is inevitable when horror is on screen and yet I wanted them to give the film a chance. Also the cliff-hanger at interval shakes you out of the drowsiness immediately. Even until half-time the use of camera will interest people who like observing the technical aspects of film-making. Very smartly the film also gives us a peek into the hardships that the actual crew might have gone through while shooting Agyaat. it felt like you were watching Sri Lanka on the ""Animal Planet"" channel - with some exotic snakes being covered from close quarters. I'm fascinated by flora and fauna so seeing snakes on big screen really excites me. Though the inherent beauty of Sri Lankan jungles doesn't leave much room for creativity, an eerie atmosphere is created. Despite the loud background score's best effort to keep you from being horrified. Not only the music in the background, but the songs are also very obviously fit in the script for pure commercial purposes. Please tell me a skimpily-undressed Nisha Priyanka Kothari is not all it takes to make a film a financial success. Anyway, she does the usual stuff a lead lady is required to do in a ""horror"" film - yell and feel scared - and does it well. That is pretty much what the rest of the cast does too. Like a gym workout. Make the expression required of your character. ""hold-Hold-HOLD AND pulse-Pulse-PULSE AND 8 - 7 - - 4 - "" you get the drift. Right. Also a couple of characters have irritating traits that make them caricatures.  Though a lot of grace marks for keeping dialogue as minimal as possible given it's a commercial project. Despite that there are a couple of scenes which could have used better dialogues instead of run-down repetition or predictability. I'd have liked a subtle hint of ambient noise to prevail as background sound. I want to know what it feels like in an RGV product. I know Agyaat had more potential to terrify than just this. It created neither warmth for nor curiosity about the characters. But I wanted to know more about the unknown. And that is what makes the end absolutely predictable. Oh well...if RGV could try different tactics to stun, he wouldn't be RGV, right?]"
813,"[At the risk of sounding extremely snotty, I didn't think I'd ever consider having a Hindi romantic film on my list of favorites. But, here I am, guilty as charged with a strong contender. There should have been 200% of credit to give away which would then be split between writer Imtiaz Ali and director Imtiaz Ali. The writer's decision to pick 2 characters and just focus on developing them, making them grow as people and yet keeping them consistent is a difficult one. It must have been tempting to shoot off into sub-plots. I'm glad they were ruthlessly avoided. My admiration for various directorial decisions kept building as the movie began. If the first few minutes of the film make you worry, it is only intentional. Trust your capable director. From the background music or lack thereo,f to the way the scenes were sewn together, the director's role is obvious. Almost every 4th or 5th film reviewed here has background music by Salim-Sulaiman but this one was so-not-in-your-face. The flow of the film from one love story into another and back is seamlessly swift. It actually reminded me of Rang De Basanti, only better, because the story was more human. Another brilliant stroke of genius is not losing the crux of the story to commercial viability. Yet it does keep the tone light enough to engage as many people in the audience as possible. Cracked the Midas touch, have we? I haven't particularly liked Deepika Padukone in her earlier films but seeing her in the cast line-up I knew if there was a person who could get her to emote it would be Imtiaz Ali. Just like he did with Kareena Kapoor in Jab We Met. And I wasn't disappointed. At least, now we know Deepika can do better than what she has done thus far. We know she can come out of the model-like within-her-frame body language. Though I seriously doubt the taste of costumes chosen for her in ""chor bazaari"". Minor irritant - shall be ignored. Of course, Saif Ali Khan has played many a romantic role. But being playful yet intense, contemporary and old-fashioned, happy but dissatisfied isn't something many lead actors in the industry could pull off. And the transition in his character is believable without being inconsistent. Looks like I'm sort-of back to being in awe of the writing. It makes you think. Is there point in pulling on a relationship that is not practical? Is it practical to give up on a relationship that means so much to you? Do you really know how much something means to you till you push it away and try to take it back on your own will. These are times when before you can ask ""Do you love me?"" you know the reply ""What is love?"" Does having it mean binding or finding someone who liberates you? Does not having it mean a space that needs to be filled or is it good riddance to bad rubbish? There are no solutions to these issues, let alone easy ones. And this one doesn't really give you an answer but it is a film and if it has a set-up and a conflict, it has to have a resolution. This is one of the most satisfying climaxes in a love story. And yet like a friend I watched the movie with said, ""I hope the 'wrong' friends don't get the wrong message."" That sentence will make sense only when you watch the film. And watch the film you must! So go already! And if you've already been, isn't it worth another watch?And the beauty is if you are not the type who likes to think so much for entertainment, you'll still enjoy it. As far as looking for the flaws, I'll watch out for those the second time around. Till then I'd like to be with this feeling of having enjoyed a film completely.]"
814,"[The grainy texture, the stylish camerawork and finesse in the editing departments, do make it a different and enriching experience. Especially, if all you see is glitter and glamour of the Hindi film world. HOWEVER, this can't make-up for the lack of detail in the story and dialogue writing areas. And that's a huge let-down. Conclusion: I felt cheated by Kaminey.Yes, most certainly there are a few plot points which make the audience think and work its way through the cause and effect. And that's brilliant because I love being treated as an intelligent audience. There was also an underlying, witty political commentary which was both funny and insightful. But to counter them there are other plot points that have unexplained skips and jumps that can of course be explained by what I call Bolly-matic liberty. This also means that there is no 'twist' in the tale, everything goes as expected - as it has been happening over the last few decades. That's not acceptable in an action thriller. I wasn't able to give a discount to the fact that it has been done purposefully and offers appropriate tributes to Apna Desh and The Great Gambler. Moreover, though the climax ties the ends alright, it does so forcefully. To use a friend's words, ""the writer gave birth to a character, so he had to kill it."" Similarly, there are loads of characters that seem to exist just to increase the width of the plot, and add nothing to the depth. I liked the fact that they are all relatively small-timers in the crime-world. None of them was over-powering and each one was answerable to someone more powerful. The connections between them all worked too. But, each one had just one quirk to differentiate himself - some worked and some didn't. But they were all the same shade of black. Okay, except for the three main characters. I understand that one point the film was trying to make is that people in or related to the goon industry are all the same. Yet, finer details were missing. There wasn't anything that made you appreciate the writers' creativity. Surely, this is one of Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra's best performances. Both of them are looking and performing better by the day. I have to confess, though I found Shahid extremely attractive, taking my eyes off Priyanka was an effort whenever she was on screen. She is charming and vulnerable, strong yet completely dependent on her lover's affection and support. The other cast were a bunch of caricatures that didn't make me care for them. Despite all the negatives, the movie is a wholesome visual pleasure. We see a lot of handheld camerawork in non-Indian films and they usually tend to make me dizzy. I find myself complaining that the camera becomes the action choreographer in action thrillers abroad. Similar camerawork is used but I felt that the interval between cuts are just that beat longer to give me an orientation of who's hitting who, where and how. The establishing shots also add to the ambience.  A lot of my complaints could be because I don't want this in a Vishal Bharadwaj product. While walking out of the theater I wondered whether I'd be more accepting of any other lesser director. But, I remembered the first 30-45 minutes of the film, I was trying hard to like the film. It just wasn't working. It's been a while since I've seen a high-profile, much-looked-forward-to, Hindi movie 3 days after its release. Much after most of the reviews are out. Though I read none of them, that the general reaction was highly positive was difficult to miss. Not to mention, the original anticipation associated with the film. I'm guilty of not being able to go in with a clean slate. But, despite giving the film benefit of doubt for my high expectations, the film lacked the steam needed for an action-packed thriller. Most glaring is the writing department, especially the dialogue and then character development. Those are the culprits which kept Kaminey from being a wholesome experience.]"
815,"[Well, well, I never thought I would live to see the day. Jackie Chan has a lead role in a film and does not indulge in any comedy or Kung fu either? Surprise, surprise, it looks like Mr Chan at the fag end of his career wants to be known as an artiste with acting ability instead of being just a kung fu clown!The Shinjuku incident is a drama about illegal Chinese immigrants. The theme about Chinese immigrants and their struggle is a familiar one in Hong Kong cinema; remember Return of the Dragon, and the much more fiery Fist of Fury, both starring the Kung Fu legend Bruce Lee? In both these films, Lee arrives to help out his fellow Chinese; in the first one as they struggle to run a restaurant in Rome and in the second as they come into conflict with the Japanese. Both these films were out and out action films, and Fist of Fury, is possibly Bruce Lee's greatest film, showcasing his coiled body and lightning fast martial arts moves. Jackie Chan is all subdued and droopy in Shinjuku incident; he adopts a despondent and woebegone persona throughout and rarely smiles. His performance is just above average, one gets slightly tired of his despair, and in the climax he indulges in a lot of shouting, which does not go down too well. The first half of the film tries to set up the main characters, but unfortunately barring one or two, none of them are fleshed out well. We remember only the Japanese cop, Inspector Kitano, and Jie. The screen play tries to weave in too many elements about the immigrants' lives; their desperation and their struggle for money, as well as the threats and challenges that they face. Somehow it does not come together cleanly, it seems a bit forced and artificial. The first half of the film also feels quite incongruous; maybe it is because we need time to adjust to Jackie Chan in his different role, or possibly it is because the frames are bright, clean, and plastic, even when what is sought to be portrayed is the grime and dirt of the city's mean streets. The intercutting of the present with a bucolic past could also be another factor. The dubbed dialogue in English does not help either. The film picks up after it has dispensed with all the initial relationship building; we sense that the director is far more comfortable once the film enters crime territory. The story then moves along with quite a brisk pace, detailing the machinations and power play that ensue. The transition of Jackie Chan's character is dealt with in a few sequences, and is not really completely believable. A love interest is also present and in what seems to be a remarkable coincidence, Bingbing Fan who plays Lily, seems to resemble Nora Miao (Bruce Lee's heroine in all three of his Hong Kong films). The climax is the film's strength, shot in low light and grainy frames (possibly to serve as a contrast to what came earlier), it is violent, brutal, and poignant. Swords are thrust through throats, knives used casually to sever and stab, and stones bludgeon and kill. Brian De Palma's Scar Face was all about the immigrants' distortion of the American dream; this film has neither the intensity nor the performances to grip you viscerally and make you lament the tragic hero. It tries hard, but instead remains just average. It is worth a watch though, simply for Jackie Chan's attempt to go ""serious"". PS And is this Jackie Chan's first sex scene or what? Blink and you will miss it!]"
816,"[I am not an admirer of Dan Brown, and though I have read the Da Vinci code, I did not bother to see the film, as I found the book to be very badly written. The fictional universe of Angels and Demons is set in a time post the events depicted in the Da Vinci code, as the initial dialogues make clear. This is not a caper film, it is not a heist film, and it is definitely not in the tradition of The Omen and The Exorcist. Both The Omen and The Exorcist had Christian themes, but dealt with eschatological and primordial fears of mankind, as portrayed through Biblical imagery. This made the films powerful and terrifying at the same time. Angels and Demons has a far more prosaic plot and is set in the modern world. Here the premise is that of a treasure hunt; a hunt where the hero has to figure out various clues to achieve the outcome. The movie that immediately comes to mind is Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was also based on a Biblical theme. But that movie had a hero with pizzazz, Indiana Jones with his trademark fedora and bull whip embodied the archetypical hero, who was masculine, dashing, and intelligent. Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon just does not make it. His role is too flat, all he does in the movie is to crinkle his eyes and spout Vatican history related dialogues. Maybe it is not Hank's fault at all, the character of Robert Langdon is very unidimensional. He exists only as a prop to keep the plot moving, and nothing else; we do not understand and relate to him as a human being, as there is a total absence of character development. That holds true for all the other characters too, the only exception being the character of Cardinal Strauss played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. But even there, it is the physiognomy and presence of Mueller-Stahl, which gives his character a definition. Ewan McGregor as the Camerlengo has the maximum screen time and is a key plot point, but is as common as they come. Stellan Skarsgard's character could have been played by a mannequin and it would have made absolutely no difference at all. The screen play makes Robert Langdon rush around Rome and Vatican City, all huffing and panting, and make his way through various churches, crypts, and catacombs, accompanied by a pretty nuclear physicist (Ayelet Zurer as Vittoria Vetra), who has absolutely nothing to do, but look suitably impressed and worried by turns. A hand held camera is used to convey a sense of urgency, but it gets repetitive after some time. The clues are all references to Renaissance works of art and would appeal only to art historians (assuming they are factually true). There is no sense of mystery, no sense of awe, as the clues are uncovered. For a film of this premise to work, this would be mandatory; the viewer must be transported to a place and time far removed from everyday reality and would at the same time experience a heightened contrast with the everyday present. The director throws in a few scenes to highlight the struggle between religion and science, but does not tilt it either way. The climax has a final twist, but one accepts it as just another happening in the scheme of things. There is no catharsis, no upsurge of emotion, and definitely no feeling of redemption as we watch it. Ron Howard is a professional and here he has dished out a Hollywood processed fast food offering; one eats it and as long as one is eating it, one is conscious that something is going on, but the moment it is over, one cannot even remember a vestige of the taste, however hard one tries. Strictly for Dan Brown fans only.]"
817,"[Will this film tug the Marathi Manoos' patriotic strings with precision? Oh yeah!.Did it work for me? Well, not in entirety.Because I'm not the target audience, here. I don't belong to the community that feels marginalized. And that's my biggest complaint against the film. A film with such a strong belief in what it's saying, it could have appealed to a larger audience. So strong is the Marathi flavor that replace this community with another one and it won't work for the Marathi community. This feeling of impotency that one community feels can be easily extrapolated to various segments of society. Sure, there are enough communities other than the Marathas who feel similar aggravation - the situation might be different, but the powerless feeling is similar. Sure, the film talks of the Marathi populace's helplessness as their own doing, and that no one really stopped them from achieving their potential. But this comes and goes away ever so slightly that amongst all the strong dialogues it feels very mild and almost irrelevant. Not to mention that the stereotyping in the first place is heavily exaggerated. These among a few other lesser important things is why the movie doesn't work. Despite the enthusiasm vibrating in the theater. Despite the sloganeering that hushes quickly, so they don't miss the next powerful dialogue. The dialogues and situations are inspiring alright, but will they inspire after one is out of the theater? Unlikely.Because the situations are ultra-unrealistic, the solutions are utopian and over-simplistic. There is no way even a fraction of the solutions implied are workable. Here, the Lage Raho Munnabhai meets Rang De Basanti approach fails because it lacks the former's adaptability and the latter's universal appeal.Almost all the performances are theatrical and you feel like you are watching a play. The staged feeling doesn't leave you for too long. Though, a couple of father-daughter scenes are handled with sensitivity and bring that lump in the throat. Yet, the film's strongest points remain its theatrical dialogues and Marathi Bana style delivery. The strong folk flavor to the music compliments the sentiment of the film too. all together keeps you attentive and entertained. They are dramatic and yet they work. And let me remind you that this is coming from a person who has no patience for over-dramatization and on-the-face loudness. With the strength of its dialogues it engages me in the drama and keeps me there.However, it doesn't get me involved. I still feel like an outsider, unable to relate to or replace any situation with what I've experienced or heard of. Maybe, I've been blessed with environments where I've never been stereotyped against. The film also made me wonder if there is any community I feel a sense of belonging towards. Couldn't think of any. Except maybe women. Maybe, some day a moviemaker will make a movie about the marginalization against reviewers and I'll feel like hooting and whistling from the audience. Yeah, yeah, I know the irony. The contradiction in first serving us the hyperbolic, sorry state of the Marathi population and then repeatedly listing one Maharastrian achiever after another in every field is annoying. And at the same time the attempt to replace the word Maratha (from the Marathi community) with Maharastriya (Maharastrian - as in a resident of a state) is commendable but again very subtle amongst the other overwhelming furor doing the rounds.]"
818,"[Bob Dylan has remained and remains a source of endless frustration for his fans, critics, and foes. Ceaseless speculation about his motives has followed him throughout his nearly fifty years of recording and performing music. His music stubbornly refuses to be categorized. He has been hated, vilified, adored, and glamorized. So how does one talk about him when sheaves of words have been said? How does one understand who the ""real"" Bob Dylan is? How does one go about trying to make a film about his life?Director Todd Haynes wisely eschews any attempt at making a documentary or a biographical epic; what he does instead is to visualize Dylan as six different characters none of whom bear the name Dylan. These characters could either be interpreted as different stages in the life and evolution of the artist, or they could be seen as an attempt to decipher what Dylan means to the soul of America, based on what is known of his life and times, as well as his repeated attempts to redefine his persona. Or they could just be the fabrications of the director, as he attempts to grapple with the constantly shifting shadows cast by Dylan's multiple psyches. Take your pick. The film does not have a plot as such; what we have are multiple strands portrayed by the different characters with each strand connecting and interconnecting in a complex weave. The film opens with a grainy black and white point of view shot of a performer being escorted onto the stage; we go up the steps, past various ushers, and then into the blinding light and noise of the stage; the viewer is reborn into Dylan's world. We see Dylan as a young eleven year old African American Woody Guthrie riding the freight train complete with a guitar, as Arthur Rimbaud who appears to be deposing before some sort of committee / press group, as Billy the Kid, as a film star Robbie, as a folk singer Jack Rollins, and as an electrified, druggy, Jude Quinn. It is Jude Quinn that the director seems to love the most. Quinn is played by Cate Blanchett, and she is turned in a virtuoso performance. Elfin, gamine, cynical, whiny, gaunt, riddler, jester, trickster; she does it all with such panache. Her mannerisms, her walk, all bring back the Dylan of the early 60's. Christian Bale is perfect as the early Dylan, all hunched up mumbler. The late Heath Ledger is Robbie, a cross between James Dean, Marlon Brando, and Al Pacino. Richard Gere looking slightly addled and world worn, is Billy. All the characters seem to have been chosen for their links to Dylan's life and music. To comprehend what each of these characters mean in the context of Dylan's life and times, one would have to be familiar with the myth, magic, and music of the man. The visual palette of the film is stunning; each segment differs according to the time period, grainy black and white footage for the late 50's and early 60's, green pastel shades with glorious yellows for Billy and Woody, and dark brown and blue green frames for the 70's segments of Robbie. The frames are technically superb in terms of the colour and visual design; they immediately transport the viewer into the respective time period. The frames also show us some of the most singular faces shot in black and white and colour; working men, African Americans, women and children. Subtitles are not used to state the year and month; instead the director lets the viewer grasp time instinctively. This renders the film as memory, a personal memory with no clear cut dates and markers. The director thus suggests that the film is not a history or a document or a record of times past.The best visuals are reserved for the Jude Quinn sequences; completely Fellinesque, surreal and hallucinatory, they are a potent elixir. There is a phantasmagoric Andy Warhol party sequence, complete with projection walls, sharp black and white contrast frames, and the people all clothed in cool. References, cross references, and allusions abound throughout the film but the director makes no attempt at analysis or explanation. For viewers who are unfamiliar with Dylan, this film does not offer any clues. In that sense it is not at all like a conventional biopic that explicates significant events in the character's life. This film is instead an adroit amalgamation of all that Dylan was, could be, and possibly will be. And through it all runs the music; sensational, stirring, heart stopping music. The music is used at key points to enhance the visuals; a love affair and its eventual disintegration is set to Visions of Johanna, I Want You, and a Simple Twist of Fate. Which other director could be this lucky?We see the ""real"" Dylan only at the end; a few minutes of footage of Bob Dylan improvising on harmonica on what sounds like I Want you. But before that we have seen much, much more; of all the images, the image of Jude Quinn gazing into the camera with a quixotic amused expression stays with us.  So does the sound of the harmonica as it blends with the whistle of the freight train and resounds in the valley. Dylan rides free as we speak; Billy says in the last lines of the movie ""It's like you got yesterday, today and tomorrow, all in the same room. There's no telling what can happen."" If you are a Dylan fan, see this film again and again and again. Savour it, relish it, and wallow in the sheer exuberance of it.]"
819,"[Nau Mahine Nau Divas can easily be slotted in the category of mindless comedy stringed together with a plot. Some of the gags and the timing with which they are delivered bring uncontrollable laughter. The flip side is that it is brutally loud throughout and gets into slapstick mode way too often for my taste. Other than the comic tone maintained through the film, there's nothing much happening in the film story-wise. The entire film is sort-of a chase sequence. A basic lie is told. When it risks being discovered buffoonery covers it up with of course another lie. The cumulative lies are at the verge of being discovered. And the cycle repeats till the climax where the most unbelievable aspect of human behavior is explored. Despite the sexual references and all the trying-to-get-pregnant related jokes, the film treats its women with a lot of respect. They are strong, influential albeit one-dimensional characters. But the one-dimensionality again is not reserved for the women. The entire film focuses hard on making you laugh hard, character development isn't even remotely on its agenda. Anyway, it ain't fair to complain about proximity to reality when that is clearly kept at a distance while writing the film. Let's just say I cannot like films like these in entirety but I thoroughly enjoy some of the episodes. There are spurts of hilarious scenes in between overbearing, over-the-top dramatics. There are also a couple of scenes which are really funny only that the punch line comes a second of two late and thus you end-up laughing before the joke comes about. But, at least you laughed, right? There's this one sequence where Deshmukh tai and her son are sort-of playing Charades to communicate with each other. The perfect synch with which the characters were interacting shows the amount of time spent on rehearsals. In general, the comic timing of the women in the film was pretty out of the ordinary. At the risk of stereotyping I must say there aren't too many women who can do comedy well and the women in nau mahine nau divas have managed that. But good scenes are few and far between. And there are just way too many ridiculous loopholes that make the film look silly rather than funny. ]"
820,"[Being kind is really not that difficult. Neither does being considerate take a whole lot of effort. And trying to put yourself in the other person's proverbial shoes will not be the end of the world. 7-year old Bokya reminds us of the goodness we carry and appreciate but also forget as we age. Like Aesop's fables, Jataka Tales, Panchatantra are some of the short stories we have grown up with. Dilip Prabhavalkar's Bokya Satbande falls in that category for many kids who understand Marathi. It is amazing how a saccharine character like Bokya is made believable. Every time I saw him say something that sounded a bit too wise for his age, I could picture one of my kids showering me with the same knowledge using similar language. Though they wouldn't necessarily be as thoughtful they are at times as good-naturedly scheming to get what they want. And yet overt, unbelievable melodrama makes its way into the climax. And it is as trying as ever and sticks out sorely.Interestingly while none of the actors do a wow-what-a-great job, they do make their characters immensely adorable. Little Aryan adopts a unique combination of mischief and maturity and is absolutely endearing. And you see his parents, his brother, his grandmother all knowingly and willingly giving in to his manipulation. Oddly enough, Dilip Prabhavalkar who has written the books, the TV series and the screenplay for the film came across as over-doing his bit. While I found his overacting extremely annoying, it seemed intentional because his act made every kid in the house laugh. What makes the film enjoyable, is in a childish sort-of a way very smart. It doesn't once let the kid go out of bounds or make his actions seem unjustifiable. Bokya is naughty but you don't see him behave irresponsibly. Even if it is to cover-up something he doesn't want his parents to know, you see him confide in his grandmother. Some of the lines entertain as much as they enlighten. There are other off-handish remarks that seem funny but are a comment about society today without being sarcastic.In movies that portray someone as overly-good, many a time the ""other"" party is painted a dark, dark black. There's no such attempt to underhandedly highlight the former's brightness here. And there aren't character transformations because of the ""good"" guy's preaching.This is a must watch for all kids - Marathi-speaking or not. Language won't be a barrier to understand humanity. I took a couple of 7-year old non-Marathi-understanding kids and they absolutely loved it. They wouldn't stop yelling 'Boooookya Satbande' for a couple of hours after the film. And well...I won't shy away from saying that I enjoyed it almost as much too.]"
821,"[We have heard martial arts aficionados lamenting long and hard for years that all their great heroes have vanished. The Boss, Bruce Lee, died years ago, and Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal who lit up the screens briefly in the late eighties have long sunk into oblivion. The scene in the East is none too encouraging either, Jackie Chan and Jet Li are ageing and showing it, so is there an action hero out there, to win our hearts and strike fear into the enemy?Yes, dear fans, do not despair, all is not lost yet. Tony Jaa detonated onto screens around six years ago with Ong Bak, where he showcased the particularly brutal Muay Thai style of kickboxing. This was the real thing, no wires, no CGI, no bullshit. Produced on a shoe string budget, Ong Bak and Tony Jaa went on to carve out their rightful seat in the martial arts pantheon. Tony Jaa is back this summer with Ong Bak 2 and this time he is clear about what he wants, he wants nothing more than to be known as ""The Action Hero"".The film opens with a spectacular sequence featuring a crocodile, a Cyclops like bruiser, spurting arteries, and barbarous weapons. What more could a viewer ask for? The pace is set and the ride then blasts off. Amongst all the action sequences, the director does make an attempt to tell a story. The story has the familiar motives of revenge and retribution and the telling does plod in parts. The sequence of events unfolds through a circular back story where the past catches up with the present. The director has thrown in a few ""reflective"" moments, which seem designed more for the viewer to remind himself / herself that he / she is still breathing after witnessing all the carnage onscreen. A brooding, long haired Tony Jaa stalks most agilely through the film and very wisely utters not more than a few lines of dialogue throughout. His large, luminous eyes, do manage to convey a degree of suffering and give a hint of the inner tortured soul that his character possesses. So what does Tony do in the film? Well, he does everything there is and more. He tames and rides wild elephants, displays his mastery of various martial arts styles including Japanese sword fighting and kung fu, dances a traditional Thai dance, and even has a romantic interest. The romance is fleeting and only hinted at in a couple of scenes. There is a spectacular fight at the end which just goes on and on with Tony fighting one masked black clad opponent after another. There is also a beautifully choreographed fight set amidst, what else, but a live elephant's tusks, what will we have next!The ending is abrupt and unclear; after all the fighting the film just sort of blanks out. Tony has the moves no doubt, he is fast, he is supple, and he has the power. In one scene he pays tribute to Jackie Chan, as he pounds the villains when drunk, in another, he fights with a three sectioned staff, a tribute to Bruce Lee and his whirling nunchaku.This film is lavishly mounted as compared to its predecessor, but suffers due to its length. The length seems to have been purely for the purpose of making sure that the viewer gets to see Tony do his stunts and fights in different contexts and in different styles. Sometimes it palls, but Tony's intensity carries it through. The fights are bloody and savage with no quarter asked and none given. Martial arts fans; make sure you see it.]"
822,"[Though the title sounds absolutely ridiculous it is filled with sarcasm for local politicians. The politicians who exercise control in their constituency only to succumb to the higher powers at the center. This mixed with humor and good dialogues had definite potential for both entertainment and hitting home a point. Instead we have an extremely annoying set of similarly corrupt politicians who seem to be fighting aimlessly.Then there's this smart alec Narayan Rao who is supposedly clean-hearted but you are never sure of his true motivations. It is left hanging loose. Vague intentions have a charm of their own but only if it is so intentionally. Ambiguity that seems inadvertent is tasteless and thus very irritating. Who is doing what and why is rather episodic and has no connection with previous incidents. This chaotic behavior of characters becomes even more abrupt with the anecdotal type of jokes. The satire in the gags is worth a few smiles but does nothing at all to give a semblance of flow from one plot to another. Not to mention that the subplots are very randomly sewn together. And the performances include the usual bunch of sketchy characters having a yell-louder-than-me-if-you-can contest. Having said all of that there is still an attempt to comment on the sad state of our power-holders. However stereotypical, there's an attempt to show how disinterested voters and party workers are in the affairs of the country. They need nothing more than a fair-skinned member of the fairer gender perform a folk dance to shift their loyalties. Yet, ultimately it is a very flat narrative filled to the brim with mayhem and inconsequential sub-plots. The potential that the name of the film has starts and finishes right there.]"
823,"[Bhagyashree carries over from Maine Pyaar Kiya to show what post-marital life would be with a simple and virtuous woman like her. Simple she may be but succumbing her character, Asmita is not. She knows her mind and will not compromise or take any crap thrown her way. Asmita, however impractical is the only beauty of this film. The rest is a lot of ho-hum and a very poor attempt at comedy. I have often wondered why a person offends in public and apologizes, if at all, in private. The basic plot of this film makes sure that the wrong-doer is appropriately humiliated in public. And that if the offended is strong in conviction they will get their way. Yet, it takes an exasperatingly long time to get there it also has loads of eye-roll inducing dialogues served along the way. Surprisingly though, there's a certain flow in the script that is lacking in many Hindi and Marathi films these days. It doesn't come across as one episode was edited to be pasted after another randomly. One event led smoothly into another. That still doesn't mean that characters are consistent or transform smoothly or are written well. And the interactions between people seem extremely superficial. There's this constant feeling of being in the late 80s-early 90s. From the way the people are dressed to their body language to the way the songs are picturised. That also means that Bhagyashree looks absolutely sweet and the other side characters absolutely obnoxious. I can't deny that it's very adorable to see a bride actually feel shy on her wedding day. If nothing else it's nostalgic for sure. But, we'd much rather watch one of the films for 90s for that, wouldn't we? Also, some out of all the really long songs are absolutely hideous. And song or no song, there's absolutely nothing natural about any of the performances - as 'put-on' as they can get. If you have the patience to sit through or forward some long speeches on values, some distasteful songs, some yawn-worthy comedy there is a pretty impractical yet novel argument in the end. But that patience will be required in abundance.]"
824,"[Dhak-a-chik-rap-a-chik-dhak-a-chik-dhakAbsolutely had to let you know how excited I am about Hindi movies being back in the theaters!!! And another... Dhak-a-chik-rap-a-chik-dhak-a-chik-dhak...because it was a pretty good restart. Nothing beats a few good hearty laughs. And this was pleasantly surprising too, considering the promos made it look like a slapstick affair. To start with, the color palette used sets it apart from the otherwise unnaturally bright comedies. Then the background music is very well done too and not loud at all. And these things were good enough to make-up for Kunal Khemu's non-voiceover voice and the lousy chase scene. I was almost sure these things would change for the worse after the titles, but the titles themselves were pretty creative and adorable. And the story line started getting interesting too.It ain't all rosy, though. The romantic bits drag a fair deal and a few lines intended to be funny fall flat. But most of the silly bits are giggle-worthy and some of the lines are actually witty or insightful or both. It helps that Cyrus Broacha is kept in tight rein - we are not subjected to his toilet-sexual-humor and he is not allowed to get loud. Kunal Khemu also doesn't annoy as much and goes through his functions without deserving either claps or slaps. This is an obvious cakewalk for Boman Irani. I absolutely enjoyed Amit Mistry's comic timing. Oh yeah, there's Soha Ali Khan too, the functional eye-candy.With all these positives and negatives delicately balanced, the final tilt towards the positive is most certainly the climax. Everything is neatly tied up in a quick wrap-up, and yet it doesn't feel like it came too soon. Also it maintains the tone of the film and there aren't any character transformations which make you go ""yeah, right!""Interestingly, the characters don't have any qualms cheating and are unabashedly aspiring for the big buck. They are all similar in their traits and goals, and they are all pretty much flat. Except for a lesson or two learnt most of them start and end at pretty much the same place. Yet it doesn't get boring because each one is a different shade of grey. I am thrilled with the way the fresh inflow of films has begun. A nice, light-weight, witty entertainer.]"
825,"[Director Neil Marshall has been heavily influenced by two important action movies of the 1980's; an influence that becomes very obvious the moment the film starts. One of those movies was George Miller's low budget Australian film Mad Max, starring a then unknown Mel Gibson, and the other was John Carpenter's Escape from New York. Both movies dealt with the future, a future where mankind and civilization lie in ruins and the only law that prevails is that of the jungle.Doomsday deals with very much the same scenario except for a few minor changes. The heroine here is a woman, Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) and in an obvious reference / tribute to Snake Plissken's character in Escape from New York, she too has an eye patch. The rest of the plot is quite the same, with a few additional elements thrown in. So how does the director rework the scenario?Well, I must say he does a pretty good job of it. For one, he does not take himself too seriously, that is for sure. He looks like he is having fun and that is wonderfully evident in a very campy scene where the leader of the Gangs / Punks, Sol, holds an audience, literally. There are strippers doing the pole routine, then a group of hefty men in tartan skirts dance the Can Can while the crowd roars uproariously, and as a climax we have a prisoner being roasted alive in a huge barbecue, with Sol shouting much to the delight of the audience ""We have a rare treat in store for you tonight! Medium... fucking... rare!"" And if that is not enough, the director sources material from another realm of fantasy, that of Arthurian legend, and locates nearly one third of the film in that realm.  There is an excellent fight sequence, where an unarmed Eden Sinclair fights a huge skulking armored brute in a most violent joust. We are not given too much time to think; footage is not spent on establishing character; the story is on cue and rolling right from the start. There is a back story, but that is very quickly dispensed with a voice over and a few frames. The rest of the film plays on one of the deepest fears that we have as human beings; that of departure from a zone of comfort to an Unknown zone which holds all possible terrors. There are no reflective moments in the film at all, none of the characters indulge in any introspection, and this gives the film a sort of breathless rush. And then there are the car chases, all of which involve a Bentley Continental GT Speed driven by Eden Sinclair. The chase sequences are a direct tribute to Mad Max, and even though the stunts are all what we have seen before in a thousand other films, it all makes for great enjoyment. We are not spared the gore either; bodies are crushed under wheels, heads get lopped off, and are also cleaved in fine fashion. Somewhere there is also a message of political duplicity and of public office being used to further one's own ends, but this is all too brief for it to really matter. Rhona Mitra makes a good action heroine, she is lithe and lean, and has the narrow eyed, square jawed look so essential to playing such a character. Her face conveys a sense of vulnerability too, and that balances out her tough and bleak portrayal. Bob Hoskins makes an appearance, and so does Malcolm McDowell. The film offers us nothing new, but it is all done in such good spirit, that one finds oneself enjoying the whole spectacle, and also rooting for the good guys. PS. An interesting aside is the character of Sol, played by Craig Conway. In this film he is Malcolm McDowell's son.Years ago Malcolm McDowell had played the character of Alex Delarge, the vicious and sadistic Droog leader in Stanley Kubrick's controversial film, A Clockwork Orange. Craig Conway's portrayal of Sol has shades of Alex. Like father, like son? (Sol literally means sun, hmm, the director indulging in a bad pun to make his point!)]"
826,"[I want to conduct a poll. Did you think the name Detective Nani and the promos imply that the film is made for kids? Yes +1. That's mine.Well, I saw it and I thought we were heavily misled. The film is hardly for kids. If at all, it could be for kids above 12 to sensitize them to conditions that some unfortunate children live in. I won't get any more specific because the film tries to be sort-of secretive about its intentions well past half-way. Rest assured that kids are going to have tons of uncomfortable questions. But, also rest assured those questions are not going to be about the dreaded three-letter word. Add to that the wanna-be cute songs and the so-humorless hour in between. Certainly not a kid-pleaser. The annoying thing is its not even made with the intention to entertain or enlighten adults. Adults know about the peddlers in our society. We've heard enough stories of supposedly well-meaning outfits being involved. There's no more insight or discovery undiscovered here. And it's all done in a very lackluster manner too.And yet the story is complicated enough to hold interest if one is really keen to. It's not a complete write-off. But there's no detailed characterization here. For example, you don't even get a glimpse of the motivations of the villains. They are there and they are evil. Enough said.None of the actors do a half-decent job of acting either. It's full of perfunctory and ""oh, I'm before the camera"" performances. Almost two and a half hours of amateur acting does get pretty tedious. There is a one-odd line that's funny and evokes a smile, but too few and thus very far in between to please anyone.I was actually hoping for something that I could take my kids for on a hot summer afternoon, a day of vacation well-spent. But, no. It's neither sweet enough for the kids, nor mean enough for the adults.]"
827,"[It doesn't take too long to come to terms with the fact that you are going to be watching a black and white film for the next two hours. It is different and thus it engages. The lack of color accentuates the Himalayan ruggedness. It takes only a few minutes to wipe off all romanticized images created by earlier movies shot in this terrain. The painful struggle of day-to-day life needs no words. And yet, words you will crave to hear by the end of the two hours - so long are some of the pauses and so dull are some of the voiceovers. You don't miss the color, even though some parts actually look like the frames have been bleached. And early on, the silences seem very artistic, and your time is fruitfully utilized in soaking in the scenery. But as the minutes pass by, the view gets monotonous and the silence becomes snooze-time. In the effort to get the mood right, the story-telling suffers. The premise is actually mundane - troubled hard-worker's goods won't sell because mechanization is taking over, his loans become an excuse for the money-lenders to cast their lecherous eyes on his beautiful daughter. But the character quirks in the beginning make them look like they'll grow interesting. The daughter does look troubled and a tad abnormal, playful - maybe a bit too childish for her age. But, by the time you realize why she seems off, you've lost interest in the film, let alone its characters. At the end, you wonder what actually was the intention of the film. Was it to make us aware of the hardships of the inhabitants of the Leh-Ladakh region - an area which we think of as beautiful, but brutality seeps deep within? Was it to narrate the story of Lasya - a teenager who is disturbed and the world around her seems treacherous? But the pathos doesn't come through. You don't really feel for her, her family or the place they call home.The supposed punch in the end is too sudden and forcefully abnormal and ""artistic"" to remain of any interest. The lack of interesting events in the last hour or so give you no motivation to decipher or interpret the possibilities of metaphors and the likes. It still doesn't take away from the fact that something different was tried. So what if the timing was off. Danny Denzongpa as the hard-working yet unsuccessful jam seller and Gauri who plays his daughter Lasya both do their best to intrigue. I don't remember Danny in such an intense role earlier. And Gauri is both beautiful and talented. I'd be inclined to say her beauty is more forthcoming because of the monochrome. But all these still do not make for a compelling or captivating watch. Sure, it's noteworthy that the typical emotional triggers are missing and thus the cinematic experience is refreshing. But unfortunately a lot of the snores also contribute to making you feel fresh as the end credits roll. ]"
828,"[Things that I can see through but are not very clearIt's present over there but the image is not clearTRANSLUCENT TRANSLUCENTThe words TRANSLUCENT replace the words 'Jai Ho' in the OSCAR-winning tune. And this is how my child is taught the meaning of translucent in his school. Educative, entertaining and to-the-point. Compare that to a film which is, in all likelihood made to entertain. Its target audience is obviously kids under 12. And all they do is moralize. Okay, mercifully there are no parents lecturing children, it's the other way around. And how? Not more than one or two adults amongst the entire cast and supporting cast of 50+ care about environment. And all, note ALL kids can lay down their lives to save the planet. If this one-dimensionality across characters was not enough, too many sub-plots are left without any closure - making you wonder why they were there in the first place. Not that you wanted more scenes with a huge sermon but at least some kind of an arc to the story would have helped. Again, the main story doesn't have too many ups and downs either. It starts with an issue, moves on the another one, magically resolving the first. Then it stays with the other one and drags ad nauseam. All child artists behave like kids who are practicing their lives' first skit at school - conscious yet self-important. The kids aren't given cute stuff to do either. The kind that would make you smile and at least keep you engaged, in the meanwhile. There are a number of references and spoofs of popular Hindi films, but I doubt many children would get the references because they might not have seen the original. And they are way to amateur and dull for adults to enjoy. Also no where are the happenings anywhere close to reality. For example, that these kids have parents who watch out for them, or look up on what they are up to at least once in a while, comes forth only in the last sequence. The climax though interesting because of its satire and the underlying truth is too late to redeem any part of the film. This is one of those that your kids might watch once and forget it soon-soon. ]"
829,"[You know those plots for typical slapsticks where four good-for-nothing men are friends for some reason. And for some reason or the other end up homeless and are looking for a landlord to fool. Or these friends have a good-natured landlord, with a beautiful relative, who one or all of them have an eye on. Or the good-natured landlord/landlady is being harassed and the foursome come to the rescue. Well we have all the four element in Paying Guests. And guess what? It doesn't mask itself by having some random name, it says at the upfront, ""Paying Guests"".First things first. The plot is a clear and outright copy of the Marathi film Ashi Hi Banwa Banwi. What can you say when the writers don't even bother to change some of the details? Of course there are a few changes, especially towards the end. But then the changes are copies or MAYBE tributes to other films. Despite all of this though, you are laughing. I'm an inch away from being a self-proclaimed slapstick-hater-thus-basher. You can imagine how the ego hurt when I found myself laughing unstoppably at some of the lines. Of course, I had to rationalize it. Many, if not almost all, the jokes are predictable. They are timed as you would expect from ace comedians/actors like Javed Jaffery/Shreyas Talpade. Though even they couldn't pull off being dressed as women and not look distasteful. Chunkey Pandey and Ashish Chowdhary manage to get a few smiles out too. Yet, there's nothing spectacularly remarkable about the comic timing of the joke per se. The hilarious bits were the reactions of the actors to the joke itself. This is best experienced rather than read about. Now, is the experience is worth tolerating 2 hours of non-stop non-sense? Especially with the inevitable loudness and exaggerated body language associated with the genre. With people running helter-skelter, hiding in closets, and banging into stuff. This brings us to the entire range of non-acting and over-acting - from Delnauz to Riya Sen to Celina Jaitley - the eye candy remains just that or not - you read some of the names on that list, right? The characters and story doesn't seem to have received much attention. And yet, the silliness of the climax is just beyond expression. It so looked like the makers were a couple of pegs down...actually make that four, when they were writing/shooting it. And you might do well downing a few too, to enjoy this one.]"
830,"[an unknown cast and makers, there's not too much the audience goes in expecting. A movie called Let's Dance the only thing, I guess you think you might catch a glimpse of are some new moves. Unfortunately there isn't anything spectacular or graceful about the choreography or the dancer. It ain't bad either, just the regular fare. I actually admired how the actor playing the protagonist, Gayatri Patel didn't come across as stunning or gorgeous. She is actually short and not stout but could be considered so compared to the other model-turned-actresses of today. She and most of the other cast had a very regular mannerism of talking except for Anjan Srivastav whose lines were delivered a little exaggerated. The cast otherwise looked like normal people going about their daily lives. This could also translate to boring. The official website boasts of six-year old Nikuunj Pandey as being ""by far the most experienced actor in let's dance."" Okay, there's it'd have been great fun to make full use of that information to trash the other actor's capabilities. But other than Aquib Afzaal's and Gayatri's accents the cast actually does a pretty decent job. And there is a non-trivial attempt at masking them accents too. All the actors bring across the character's traits. Aquib's attitude, Gayatri's sincerity, Ajay Chaudhary's chocolate boyishness, Master Abhaas Yadav's simmering frustration, and Sugandha Garg's practical approach to life - all add to the facets of the story. Unfortunately though the story doesn't move forward much, and when it does, it stays there for so long that it feels like no progress has been made. There are a few interesting elements in both the main and the sub-plots but they are extremely predictable. So, when the expected happens it is the usual feeling of anti-climax. It doesn't feel like the sort-of conflict leads anywhere because of the forgone conclusion. The transformations and events are all too convenient and basically a cop-out.If at all a little more was put in, in terms of creating an engrossing atmosphere, this film could have triggered a little interest. Alas, a good-natured plot and well-meaning characters can take a film only so far. ]"
831,"[Right from one of the cheesiest title sequences of the past few years, second only to maybe Welcome you can tell you are going to paraphrase the title from ""Who should I love?"" to kisse badla loon? ""Who should I avenge?"". But yet we are fair around here, so we don't pass judgment until we've seen it through to the end credits. No respite in sight. Oh well... What is so bad about the film? I think it'll just be easier to start with what's good about the film. Well, you can see Arshad Warsi's comic timing genius when he's trying to make the best of the sorriest lines ever. Especially when he tries to muster half-a-smile out of you with the references to masturbation. Why he does this to himself (no pun intended), I'm willing to give my right tiny toe to know. Ashish Chodary ... ok, now that's not a typo nor is it me trying to crack a good one, that's how his name is spelt in the opening credits! Anyway, Ashish - I admire him for his capacity to make a fool out of himself - film after film after film - playing a dog fetching biscuits or just acting human-silly. Anyway, you can't associate too much intelligence with someone who's signed a script like this. Ditto for Yash Tonk. The women do what women in such films do - play dumb, hold one expression throughout as if they are charged a fine if they changed it. Same rules seemed to have been applied to the costume designer who was told to make the most unwearable outfits possible. The story line of course is that these three are friends and generate loads of money though they don't really have a means of livelihood. Sorry, I digress. One of them falls in love with a girl who can't stand the sight of the other two. And so the battle begins. But since this is not enough masala to make a 80s film, we have a villain, an inspector, and a godfather thrown in. And since it is after all not a film from the 80s, we have random references to them sprinkled across. Actually it's wrong to call the references random because that'd be like saying only they are random. The entire product is one huge display of arbitrary  human misbehavior. What exactly is anyone thinking while writing, directing, producing something like this is beyond me. Just plain incomprehensible.]"
832,"[Movie ticket: Rs. 150Coffee + water: Rs. 60Guy in front of you banging his head in despair: PRICELESSIt's nice to know you have company for your sentiment towards the movie, right? I've never fancied horror too much. But while watching 13B I was wondering what I dislike more - the squirms when the movie is done well or the annoying 'typical' camerawork and background score which make it unintentionally funny. Some of these standard techniques were just too in the face and obviously annoying. That the movie took a turn for the better in the latter half didn't help much, because by then the enthusiasm of watching the movie had worn off. And since the TV is doing the haunting and making accurate forecasts, you end up seeing everything twice - once in the TV prediction and then in the movie. And sometimes the makers feel obliged to repeat a dialogue or two even after the first repetition. And if not that, then the TV was spoon-feeding us just in case we missed the point that real life was replicating reel life. Not to mention that the appliances taking over life bit is rubbed in till you are just about to begin tearing your hair apart. And why is there such a lack of creativity in trying to horrify us? When was the last time violins rising up to a crescendo didn't bring snickers and eye-rolls? I was craving a normal, straight, non-close-up shot. Some bits are so slow that the director without a doubt knew that the audience would know what is about to happen. Then, why would he do that? And am I the only one bothered when 'the unknown entity' is obsessed with the house address without any rhyme or reason? Madhavan though does a good job of portraying Manohar's anger, his frustration, his vulnerability. The rest of the cast is just about ok. A potentially scary concept was completely messed up. But, just imagine this. All the soap operas on television - what if our real life starts replicating them. Or we believe that our lives are replicating them and they become self-fulfilling prophecies. Now, that's what I call horror!]"
833,"[A wise man (Leon Trotsky?) once said, ""Everything is relative"". So if you compare Dhoondte Reh Jaoge to the regular ""three men get together to earn some easy money"" plot, you'll feel like a rag collector in the backyard of a 5-star hotel. Because it doesn't once loose focus. Other masala comedies start with mayhem, keep it going with chaos and end with utter pandemonium. The commotion created by this one though works towards the ultimate goal. But commotion there is, I guess it maybe called inevitable for this genre.This goal is a hilarious one. A producer (Paresh Rawal) gangs up with a smart Chartered Accountant (Kunal Khemu) to make a flop film. Why? When? What? You have to see the movie to find out. But what starts off with a decent sense of humor turns into one random poor joke stringed after another random poor joke. The smartness of the basic idea doesn't run through the film. And by the way, bring me a Chartered Accountant who wears anything other than blue, gray and white...and ok black.The individually funny elements are ultimately forced together, the flow ignored. The major concern of movies like this one must be - ""How do we end this madness?"" If you give it a mellow end, it'd feel like an anti-climax. If you give it a realistic end, it contradicts the tone of the rest of the film. If you end it on a happy note, it is predictable and cliche. So let's just make it obvious that we weren't interested in the climax and be done with it quick and easy. And fairly quick and easy it must have been for Paresh Rawal (Raj Chopra) to play the conniving conman. A couple of his scenes had me in splits. Sonu Sood (Aryan Kapoor) wears a sullen look almost through the movie. However, I enjoyed watching him go all starry-eyed when his girl is around. Kunal Khemu (Anand Pawar) seems to have done everything alright but yet he's not convincing as a geek or a guy who's in love or a schemer or a guy with confidence issues. Maybe it was the way his character was written. Soha Ali Khan (Neha) actually looks too smart to play such a dumb character. There seems to be no connection whatsoever between Anand and Neha. Both the actors and the way the romantic sub-plot is put together can share the blame for that one. It would be sheer stupidity if there are characters in a movie who are producers and film actors and it didn't have mention of other Hindi movies, right? And stupid they aren't. So there is an attempt to collect all the references they wanted on one page. Thread them together in a reasonably funny sequence with witty one-liners evenly spaced out. And go berserk. Then slowly deteriorate into a predictable pun-mode. There are a few additional bits they spoof well though. Like the comment on the role of women in Hindi movies. But that again was a good excuse for not giving the women characters any attention. Another comment is on the audience's capacity to lap up one irrational movie after another. And how there's no formula to make a successful film. Also it alludes to the fact that the makers have no judgment of the viewers' expectations. Actually, Dhoondte Reh Jaoge is in a win-win situation. If it goes down well with the audience - Yay! Hurray!! Chak De!!! If it doesn't the makers can say - ""Duh! It was intentional!!"" ]"
834,"[Imagine you are visiting a friend or relative and they happen to have invited a group of friends. You as an audience are then just sitting in a corner and observing these people interact and react with each other. You know bits and pieces of their lives and are exposed to their prejudices and vulnerabilities. Karma aur Holi is not too worried about the pace. It doesn't at all look rushed especially considering that it's covering some 10-odd characters in just 90 minutes. And while a movie that covers so many characters usually jumps from one's story to another this one had a certain flow. That it was all happening in one house might have contributed to that feel. Because it's just like the audience is walking from one room to another. Also after a long-long time the characters accents felt real. The casting was just perfect. The gorgeous Sushmita Sen is perfect as the charming hostess, Mira. She juggles between being diplomatic and firm like any home-maker would do. Randeep Hooda, Mira's husband is trying to run a business while sticking to his guns. And then there are the whole range of characters from various age groups and ethnicities. I particularly enjoyed Rati Agnihotri's performance as the jittery, intolerant, middle-aged mother of a teenager. The teenage son was pretty good at what he did too! And I almost wanted to counsel Suchitra Krishnamurty's character as the suppressed wife to break the shackles and run for her life. One character we wouldn't have missed would be the voiceover narrator! He was so redundant. As usual, such stories feel a desperate need to have a resolution for each character. And the desperation shows. Thankfully though the closure for most of the threads is not forced. Except for the Rati Agnihotri-Suresh Oberoi angle. The transformation there was absolutely unwarranted and left a very 'this happens only in films' feel. And yet despite all the things that were good about Karma aur Holi, there was a 'no big deal' attached to it. The holi and suburban New York background had nothing to do with it really. The characters were all very similar either us or someone we know. That gives it a real feel but it also doesn't make it anything spectacularly special.]"
835,"[Honestly, I'd be more than happy to have a one-line review here saying - ""Go watch the movie! Period."" But that would be a lazy woman at work. It's always difficult to point a finger at what you liked in a movie. It also sort-of takes away from the experience by intellectualizing and breaking down something that you enjoyed as a whole. But you gotta do what you gotta do, so here goes. When the opening credits begin a few minutes into the movie, I was shocked to realize - not once in those 3-4 minutes did it cross my mind that I was actually listening to a character give a political, inspirational speech. The visuals of those were so engaging and Kay Kay Menon's expressions so intense that they completely occupied my senses. For a person who gets bored very easily by monologues that even remotely sound like lectures, this was one big score on the positive side. The effort spent on casting showed in every pick and they performed well too. To name one would be to do injustice to the other and the list is really long. The women might seem a bit off because of their eccentricities but then again that might have been very intentional because they are not your regular 'miss goody two shoes' women-next-door. And the positives only grew in number after that. Sure there's politics, and there's an undercurrent of romance. But there's a lot more happening underneath. There's dissatisfaction everywhere. The entire chain of power from the fieldworker to the henchmen to the puppet-leader to the chief strategist wants to exude confidence, power and smart-Alecness till the next person higher up comes in. Each one wants to claim superiority and find someone to pull down. Now, this is as true in state politics as it is in home or office politics. There are many more subtle things which only a second or third viewing can uncover but you somehow sense their existence. And there are of course, what I call the director's eccentricities like the blue-and-red man and the flautist. Then there's this strong sexual and gender-bias flittering around in this ecosystem. Though Anurag's women all seem to have a fierce sensuousness about them, they don't seem unreal and neither does it seem out-of-place, forced, contrived or any such thing. This I need to mention because I very liberally label an unnecessary expression of sexuality 'gratuitous'. I always get apprehensive when I begin looking forward to a movie. The last thing anyone should do to themselves is spoil their experience because of their own expectations. But, one thing we can safely look forward to with a Anurag Kashyap film now is awesome and novel music, even better lyrics and perfect use of the compositions. Too many words to describe something that one needs to get completely absorbed and soaked in. Let me just stop writing here, so you can stop reading and go watch the movie. ]"
836,"[A movie starts and it goes on and on and on. Not in terms of sluggish pace, but just that it's playing and you are watching because you are there - indifferent and uninvolved. It is movies like these which try to stylize Kunal Khemu and Fardeen Khan that make you appreciate the charisma of Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan. At least their screen presence makes them worthy of all the slo-mo entries they've been awarded over the years. Kunal Khemu has just no oomph factor whatsoever; why he's asked to don ""star"" like mannerisms is just incomprehensible. Not to mention that he has a very annoying voice and dialogue delivery style. Reminds of the shrieky, eye-candy women in regular Hindi slapstick films. And Fardeen Khan does his tiny-mouth-pout with a nose flare that only he is capable of, to emote anger and love. It's not like there isn't room for variation in the concept but the emotions run only skin-deep. The story is no great shakes, as in, by and large things are predictable. But, every once in a while there are a couple of lines or a tiny twist that take it away that little bit from the absolutely thoughtless genre of films. And here again it is left at that and not taken an inch deeper.Like any other movie of this style, songs appear 'just because...' But what gets annoying is the ridiculous set designs and wannabe 'stylish' type of camerawork during the songs. Also the voices used for the actors are so different from their own voices that they distract even more from the viewing experience. Though there was this one visual with Dia Mirza wearing a bright red and orange flowing skirt and swaying around in radiant-blue sea water. Whether her dress was losing color in water or the colors were mixed intentionally it doesn't matter. It was just beautiful. Anyway, this is yet another absolutely skippable movie. But, if you happen to see snippets, you can hold on for a bit.]"
837,"['It's ok to be gay', 'Imperfections make people real', 'Laughing at yourself loosens you up', 'Loosening up is of utmost importance to live life king-size', and 'A life shouldn't be lived without love' - all tacky lines yet noble thoughts. But when they are given an additional coat of honey with misty eyes, etc they become just too cheesy to digest. Because of these sloppy lines the very pertinent, contemporary, and important subject at hand seems like a joke.  There is no attempt at avoiding cliches. Sure gays are not the butt of jokes but the other elements used are slapsticky. I understand that a subject needs to be treated lightly for it to be approachable. But, this attempt to make gay look normal is done without any sensitivity to the gay guy's pathos. It is a brilliant concept to try and project homophobia without embarrassing homosexuals or stereotyping them. It is also an awesome idea to consider what might happen if this homophobic suspects that he is gay, good grief! For him and sadly for us, as an audience too. And this entire hullabaloo to what end? Never mind the process of getting there is absolutely irrational, hardly relatable, and very suspiciously real. Also there is no flow in the process of one event leading to another. Characters are either flat or transform too easily. Some gags seem really forced in, for example, it feels like a character is given a particular name only so that a specific pun is used. It is sickening that I couldn't feel anything for a character played by Vinay Pathak. After movies like Bheja Fry and Dasvidaniya with Vinay Pathak in the lead you sort-of begin to trust his choice of scripts and you know that at the very least they are going to be different. And different, Straight is. Only that different unfortunately doesn't always translate to good or in this case even average. How can any out-of-the-ordinary script do so much injustice to Vinay Pathak that every time he comes on screen, it hurts? An equally pertinent question would be why Gul Panag spent her energies on a ping-pong ball type of a role. Yes, yes, explanation coming through. Remember, the woman in Hindi cinema from the 80s-90s? How she would be tossed around from Hero number 1 to Hero number 2 or parent or villain and back to Hero number 1? How can an intelligent actor like Gul and her equally intelligent character Renu do this to herself? I just can't stop shaking my head in despair I wouldn't even know where to begin in describing my dejection with the entire sound design and visuals. Suddenly, they make you feel like you are in a cartoon film. I admit I liked the first time a car in London transitioned into a tempo-truck on an Indian road. But then, the technique was repeated too often with too loud a whoosh to be likable any further. There are way too many coincidences in the story and we are asked to make way too many assumptions for this film to work. It's very important that sexual orientation become common talk in our lives and movies are the way to begin.  But shoddily done films aren't going to cut the deal.  And thus another half-decent plot goes more zig-zag than straight and in vain.]"
838,"[Firaaqisn't the first film about the communal riots in Gujrat. And it isn't the first well-made film either. You can sense each character being approached with sensitivity yet there's no attempt at sensationalizing by gory visuals or lengthy dialogue or dramatizing trauma. All of these have huge potential and are often used in movies with this backdrop.As dead bodies are passed along in the first few scenes you know this is going to be serious business. And Firaaq offers no respite. Male chauvinism, identity crisis, communal differences effecting friendship, impact of violence on a young mind, a philosopher's hope, rebel by the suppressed, an innocent victim's helplessness, misuse of the angst created, and ultimately the mother of all issues - no solution in sight. All of these are brought to you one after the other, relentlessly. These facets of human nature rightly need a variety of characters. The effort behind writing each character shows clearly. Sure some of them, like a chauvinist Gujrati husband (Paresh Rawal) or an agitated Muslim (Nowaz) might have been easier to write because they play on the standard stereotypes. But, others like the sensitized house-wife (Deepti Naval), the confused urban businessman (Sanjay Suri) have been worked hard upon. Use of multiple languages adds to the realistic environment created. A sudden line of profundity comes in just like one person from a group of friends might spurt one out while arguing about some socially relevant issue. And yet the movie is not entirely engaging. It could be because it offers no closure but that also leaves a sense of incompleteness. for a movie so careful about what it's trying to say, there were some scenes which didn't really belong. It's difficult to imagine that they were there without a purpose but because I didn't understand them they distracted me. White, black or gray - not one actor leaves an ounce of doubt in terms of believability - including some of the side characters. Again with a film so full of brilliant performances, it's difficult to name one even if it is the most senior of them. Because even a child with his blank eyes contributes equally to the film as do the veterans. There aren't any strong fundamentalist characters who are propagating their agenda. So there are no lectures. In fact you see how situational each character's behavior is. There are some brilliant moments that are subtly enacted which are better experienced than read about in a review.Firaaqvery, very carefully doesn't take sides. There are as many ""good"", ""evil"", and ""indifferent"" characters from both Hindu and Muslim communities. If at all, it points a finger, it aims a big fat one at the bias of the state's administration. As with any film that has multiple stories running in parallel there are jerky cuts. But these are kept at a minimum and on the contrary some transitions are done really well. It's also nice to hear the background music come about only occasionally. That grants so much more subtlety to the entire film. The aftermath of the riots in Gujrat is captured by the trauma that each human in the city is facing. And of course, Firaaqalso talks about the non-humans who looked upon this as an opportunity and took advantage to their fullest capacity.]"
839,"[The deja vu feeling makes you uneasy as you see the ""Amerika-returned"" boy look for a suitable match in India. The set-up that you must have seen umpteen number of times in various movies touching upon the issue. And unexpectedly, the cliched setting of an arranged marriage meeting changes into a quirky comic situation. The smile that starts at that point stays on until after you've left the theater. Sure there aren't any laugh-your-guts-out moments but there are many sweet comic moments and a few idiosyncratic elements that render a light and yet complex texture to the story. Very cleverly Aloo Chat salutes the alternative to eloping - a trend set by Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Intermittently, it also reminds you of the number of Hrishikesh Mukherjee/Basu Chatterjee films set in middle class families. Though it is a good start towards being one of them, it doesn't come close to becoming one. The Mukherjee and Chatterjee films had a knack of making the most improbable situations seem real. Here a possibly real situation seems contrived. And yet you are reminded of films like Chupke Chupke, Bawarchee and Hamari Bahu Alka.The story is sprinkled with interesting characters. From Nikhil's (Aftab Shivdasani's) resentful dad to his suspicious maternal uncle, Chaddami to his tolerant grandmother to the street-side chaat vendor - each one was given lines that added to their personality. There is something very refreshing about Chaddami who is supposedly a fool everyone loves to put down but is actually the most observant of them all. The cast is not outstanding because it is still caricature-like and the film does tend to slip into slapstick mode every once in a while. But, they all do a good job of making us smile with their timing and the specific style of dialogue delivery assigned to each one of them. There is also this underlying element of putting things in perspective or emphasizing the fact that 'everything is relative'. This is done through the story and not explicitly verbalized. Sure, the film goes into preachy mode only for about two sentences towards the end. But that's hardly anything to complain about. It is ultimately a clean comedy that doesn't even pretend to make you laugh out loud. Neither does it try to be a technically brilliant product. They just want you to grin and smirk and think about a socially relevant issue. And achieve that, they do.]"
840,"[What does a person wish in his life - love, money, respect or all of this? Every common man wishes for all of this and these wishes are what Barah Aana basically talks about. Needs, desires and  dreams bring people together but they also test trust and sanity.These aspirations bring the three lead players of this story together. Each one has his own dreams and needs, and is working hard to meet them. But, with one incident, their approach to life not only changes  but also exposes the darker side of their quests. This is a dark comedy about the lives of common people and director, Raja Menon, handles it deftly. Though his debut film, Bas Yun Hi sunk without trace, with this film Menon proves that he is an accomplished storyteller. The problem, though, is with the story he has decided to tell. It doesn't have the bite to grip you. The screenplay is decent enough to keep you guessing, but the movie gives you a feeling of incompleteness. The dialogues are crisp and witty, and sometimes even howlarious. It is that kind of a movie, where after watching it, you take back few incidents and performances and not the movie as a whole.Menon has superbly cast his three protagonists. Vijay Raaz is the utter face of the common man. His body language, his expressions and his dialogue delivery are as perfect as always. He will remind you of every third person you see walking on the street. One knew that Arjun Mathur has talent after watching him in Farhan Akhtar's short film Positive and in the recent Luck By Chance. Barah Aana only supplements this fact.Naseeruddin Shah is his usual self - Brilliant! Raja Menon, makes  the veteran's character speak his first word only in the second half of the film, but still makes the audience whistle out loud at every body movement of the super-actor. The title signifies the three-quarters and not the full worth awarded to the efforts of a common man. It's the same with the movie. It does not rise up to its full worth and is disappointing as the film could have delivered a lot. But it's a decent watch nonetheless.]"
841,"[That the specter of the Holocaust continues to prey upon the psyche of Europe and to some extent America, as evinced by the number of films and documentaries that are made with unceasing regularity, nearly seventy years post World War II, comes as no surprise, given the agony and torment that the Holocaust generated. Some of the notables in the recent past have included, Roman Polanski's The Pianist, Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful, and Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List.  Most of them have depicted events from the Jewish point of view; of suffering Jews struggling for survival in the face of extreme cruelty perpetrated by the Nazis, or else they have been about people who in some way rescued Jews from the ""Final Solution"". The Reader deals with the Holocaust too, but presents itself fundamentally as a love story and a tale of lost innocence; a love story between two highly disparate individuals who in some ways are quite like each other. The film follows a non linear narrative; continuously juxtaposing the present with the remembered past and then plunging back into the not so recent present. This could get confusing for some viewers; but as one has to follow the lives of primarily the two main characters and their encounters with each other, a little patience is well rewarded. Stephen Daldry who earlier gave us the beautifully understated Billy Elliot is in charge here, and he makes a solid job of it. The film opens with an adult Michael Berg played by Ralph Fiennes, ruminating over his past where he has a chance encounter with Hannah (Kate Winslet). We do not see Fiennes for nearly two thirds of the film, except in brief moments, as the story is about his younger self and that is played by David Kross. The first half of the film is shot in soft focus and in warm colours, highlighting the first flush of love for the young Michael and also possibly the discovery of his own sexuality. This phase of the film comes across as idyllic, and we slowly come to understand that both Michael and Hannah have some things in common. The rest of the film then deals with more traumatic events, events that have influenced a nation and whose very presence seeps into the lives of future generations. The film raises questions about collective guilt, shame, individual choice and responsibility, and the notion of justice as different from law and morality. These issues are teased out through the lives of the two protagonists, who exemplify ""normal"" individuals, but from two different generations. Both protagonists have made choices, and continue to make them, but we are never very sure about their motives. This ambiguity in both the characters is highlighted repeatedly, thus possibly making us aware of the shortcomings of being human; shortcomings for which we have no clear answers. The strength of the film lies in how it takes the overarching theme of the Holocaust and examines it through the perspective of two ordinary German citizens. The script builds layers by commenting on the nature of forgiveness and reconciliation, by examining the role of the legal system, and by depicting the tremendous repercussions such ""historic"" events have on day to day living. The film has no heart stopping moments, no heart wrenching dialogues; it is deeply emotional but it is all done in a subtle and restrained manner. As with life, the film does not offer us a closure and a neat resolution, and questions remain unanswered. Ralph Fiennes is a pleasure to watch as always, while David Kross portrays the adolescent and later the troubled young Michael Berg, very well. Kate Winslet's ample curves are on display early on in the film, but it is in her face and her eyes, that her character germinates. The Reader is not an easy film to watch especially for Indian viewers; we have nothing comparable to the Holocaust embedded in our collective consciousness. True, the Partition and its related cruelty and inhumanity have happened, but they seem to have been completely buried as far as popular culture is concerned, barring a stray film here and there. That the Partition has spawned and continues to spawn intolerance and violence has not really been examined and commented upon. That could possibly be because we as a Nation, collectively reject notions of History, and instead are very comfortable embracing Mythology in its stead. The Reader is a very European film, in the sense that it examines History through a critical lens and digs deep into the collective well spring of national consciousness. Definitely worth a dekkho. PS. The film uses the leit motif of reading and of a literary consciousness to underscore the lives of the two protagonists. Again very European, this use of literature and literacy as a perspective on human thought and action.]"
842,"[David Fincher is known for his films that tend to be ruminative, bleak inquiries into the human condition, as seen through the eyes of the chief protagonist. His earlier Seven and Fight Club both starred Brad Pitt and were extremely grim. Here he teams up with writer Eric Roth (of Forrest Gump fame) and Brad Pitt for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and gives us a film which is in parts hopeful and uplifting, with respect to its take on life and living. One essential feature of being human is our capacity to reflect on our lives; we try hard to make some sense out of all the chaos that we experience. We are bound by Time; we are born young and are inexorably doomed to age, and die. That is something we cannot defeat. One tends to visualize life as a journey; a journey where we acquire companions and lose them, knowing fully well that there would come a time when we would be lost to others too. But what if it all happened in reverse? Just supposing that one is born old; then the journey would start with old age and end with baby hood. This would provide us with a completely different perspective; we would be born looking at the world with eyes that are old and rheumy and die in the cradle. This is the angle that the film adopts, and the director and writer use this outlook to fashion a story about the chief character's (Benjamin Button) life. The similarities with Forrest Gump are immediately obvious; Benjamin is born with a debilitating physical condition, there is a woman who remains the love of his life, he moves through well defined time periods in American History, and tries to make sense of it all and in the process gives some pithy sayings about life. The key difference is that in Forrest Gump, History was one of the main characters, Gump existed as a prop for History; here History is given short shrift(though we are constantly aware of it as an addendum to the frame). The movie is not that cheesy either (remember that line about life and a box of chocolates in Forrest Gump?), it instead comes across as a rather detailed portrait of Benjamin Button. The movie has three stages: Benjamin's childhood, his coming of age as he leaves home to learn a trade, and his eventual return and death. Brad Pitt is Benjamin Button and his portrayal is satisfactory Special effects technologies are employed to transform Brad Pitt's physical appearance at various stages in the film. The special effects are very well done, including the makeup for the face and skin, that blend completely into the frame. But Pitt's acting somehow falls short; as a child Pitt does nothing that would demonstrate the limitations that his body has with respect to his mental age.  We see no glimpses of mischief, nor of childlike curiosity barring a couple of fleeting scenes. But that is it, and somehow this tremendous opportunity to reflect on how a young child (mentally) trapped in an old and aged body would respond is completely lost. Benjamin Button's character also comes across as too goody goody, there is nary a bad bone in his body and he is constantly polite and clear of heart. That is something difficult to digest, and especially with his physical condition. We see no signs of frustration, irritation, or anger; he is as sweet as an angel throughout. Contrast this with Daniel Day Lewis's performance in My Left foot for example. The supporting cast is tremendous. Taraji Henson as Queenie is very good and so is Tilda Swinton as Elizabeth Abott. The portrayal of the tugboat captain, Captain Mike, who considers himself an artist, by Jared Harris is brilliant. Cate Blanchett is adequate throughout; she looks particularly radiant when she plays the younger Daisy. David Fincher maintains a steady tempo and sticks to old fashioned story telling; no sudden shifts in time, no fast cuts, and no handheld cameras either. The tale unfolds at a leisurely pace, and is packed with incidents, and hence the pace does not flag. The period feel is beautifully recreated; the opening footage of the clock maker who makes a clock which runs in reverse, the scenes of Benjamin's childhood in the old age home, the meetings with Elizabeth Abbott in the lobby of the Russian hotel, all look and feel natural. The movie seems to suggest a subversive message - that old age is not all that bad and that growing younger is something to be feared and avoided. This is in complete contrast to the youth obsessed consumer culture that is prevalent today. The movie also possibly points out that both old age and childhood are nearly the same - something that the Bard of Avon also pointed quite some centuries ago. This is a film which flows gently; there are no sudden surprises, no fortuitous acts of God either. Overall the film is rock solid without being outstanding, and is definitely for those who would want to think about their lives in the dark comfort of a theatre.]"
843,"[Domestic violence and women's empowerment would be the superficial issues that Videsh touches upon. Though these are by no means trivial, there are several deeper matters the film also tries to talk about. There's reference to the fact that strength of human willpower is generally under-rated. But one's strength doesn't necessarily have to be just willpower or intelligence or courage; it can be a subtler and a more abstract human capability. True - physical, verbal and thus mental abuse by different members of the family do make the marriage shown here incomparable to an average marriage. But the incompatibility between expectations and realities of a marriage are true of any marriage.  Preity Zinta gives the character, Chand, her vulnerability and her strength, her fear and her defiance. I can watch Videsh a few more times just to appreciate the nuances of her deglamorized performance. Vansh Bhardwaj plays her husband Rocky and does an equally laudable show. Given these acts and how well-thought the film is, it's difficult to imagine that the wooden expressions worn by the rest of the cast are unintentional. The glaring non-performances must have a reason I haven't been able to figure out. If nothing else, the indifferent faces effectively add to Chand's loneliness. This feeling of being alone while in company is magnified by the use of silence and of poetic prose in Chand's dialogues. Her disintegration due to her circumstances are a product of Rocky's aversion to talking - which means a wise non-usage of words to build his character. His silence frustrates us as an audience and sort-of makes us feel his frustration though we are not aware of the specifics. Then you have references to the Almighty and His influence on our lives is something that irks me often because of the kitschy way it is done in Hindi films. And in general, unless the plot's underlying assumption is the supernatural phenomenon, it works against the film. But, here in its quirky way, Videsh uses these things to represent the moral support and the liberation Chand feels. It also added to the heavy cynicism apparent in the title of the film Videsh - Heaven on Earth. A foreign land where Indians will do anything to go, but will end up creating anything but heaven there. And yet I feel something other than magical intervention would have worked much better as a symbol. The eerie close-ups, the slightly annoying handheld camera work, the unsettling silence due to the lack of background music, all add to the claustrophobic atmosphere Chand must experience in the ""free"" Western world. None of the outwardly issues touched upon have anything new about them - an abusive family, sarcasm at Indians' attempt to create India outside India, human crassness, strength of women, etc. But the philosophical bent given to the movie makes it far more superior to any other movie in this genre.]"
844,"[Nope. There's no hope of anything to do with Akshay Kumar ever being unglamorous or non-stylized. If Nagesh Kukunoor can't do it, no one can. Given that 8 x 10 Tasveer is a thriller, maybe the whole super-heroic personality accorded to the main lead is very intentional. But, it borders disbelief so closely that the film feels more like comedy and doesn't strike awe at all. And I'm not yet talking of the superpowers he has. That Jai (Akshay Kumar) can look into the past has to be accepted as an assumption. The weird mumbo-jumbo provided as explanation is only to be ignored. Once you do that, it's an interesting concept and opens a world of opportunities. Nagesh's use of his protagonist's ability gives the regular ""who dunnit"" a very nice flavor. Jai realizes things bit by bit and with him the audience becomes aware of what had happened. This slow unfolding adds to the curiosity. And yet somehow there's no connection between Jai and me as an audience. There's a distance which stays through the movie and doesn't let me get too involved. I blame the over-dramatization for that. Either the hero or the villain resurrecting like he is The Terminator is just too 80-90ish for me and thus exasperating.  ""Die already"" you feel like yelling from the audience. This reminds me of the ""fall already"" that a viewer actually yelled in the theater at the never-ending, pointless jump that Jai makes in one of the early sequences. Had the whole theater laughing! The script does a good job of pointing a finger at all involved. Just like a person looking for an answer would suspect every one around him. But my problem with such mysteries is that the foreshadowing is more an attempt to confuse than to give a tiny bit away. Deleting elements from a scene and then later showing that element is no way of saying, ""caught you!"" It's cheating. Twists are awesome and I love it when they catch me unaware. But some of the twists here either come a tad too late and you can pre-empt them. Or they are almost out of the blue and a little too difficult to digest. Another thing that annoys me is the villain spelling everything out to the hero and thus to the audience. There surely must be a better way to go about this. Even if you discount for the fact that action films don't necessarily need a whole deal of acting, most of the performances are wooden. Especially Girish Karnad - there was a sizable amount of guffawing at his dialogue delivery. While Akshay Kumar does his usual bit, Ayesha Takia is just about tolerable. What's happening to this woman who was so impressive just two years ago. Javed Jafferi on the other hand brought a smile if not laughter with every movement - this time very intentional. By the way, I shudder to think what Nagesh will do if he ever has a full blown bedroom scene in his script. Just a hug comes out as heavily awkward. Or was Sharmila Tagore strutting around with the censor scissors on set? Drop the baggage associated with a Nagesh Kukunoor film. He seems to be struggling to strike a balance between his sensibilities and those of mainstream cinema. Don't worry, the stylish titles will help you along - they are really slick but so not what you associate with the Kukunoor name. Maybe he's trying to say, ""I can make such films too!"" Also, keep the Akshay Kumar 'star' style tag on sans the loudness - thankfully! And then you might give yourself a good chance to enjoy this.]"
845,"[Have you ever passed by those cartoons on TV which are translated in Hindi? In which dubbing for all characters seem to be done by two people - one male and one female. In which the amount of nasal shrillness defines the acting in the voice acting. The entire film is dubbed like this. Don't know what I'm talking about? Sample this -  !! WARNING !! This is just an example of the dubbing. It is neither supposed to imply that the film is entertaining nor does it mean that it is for kids. To be fair, maybe there are four voices and not just two. The dubbing in this film made me realize what an important role it plays in our experience. Not that there are too many great lines to remember this film by, but even if there were it would have been difficult to enjoy them because you are trying to figure out which language the actors were originally speaking in. By the end, I concluded that they lost the script during dubbing and entirely different dialogues were used instead of the original lines said while shooting. Sure, every time dubbing is off-synch it's distracting, but here it is so off that it was difficult to even figure out whether the actors were emoting or just saying the lines. Such is the impact of this film that if you see this one before Dev D or Gulaal, it will effect your enjoyment of Mahie Gill's brilliant performances in them. If a fine actor's act is questionable, do I really need to talk about the acting skills of questionable cricketers? Another change in career is on the way for both Vinod Kambli and Ajay Jadeja, hopefully. Actually, Vinod Kambli's character has no specific function in the film! There is an off-chance that the film was desperately trying to spoof not-so-well-thought-out Hindi films. Which could explain a child artist playing a producer, his adamant demand for an ""item number"", the disgruntled writer who will tell his story to anyone who is willing to lend an ear, the random fights, songs, continuity jumps, shoddy editing, etc. But I have a feeling this is more my brain working overtime rather than the scriptwriter giving his script an iota of thought. Each scene accentuates the bewilderment, ""How could they not see how stupid it is!?"" At various points in the film, the body language of the actors is such that you wonder whether they were briefed on the emotion required at all. They just seem to be doing their own thing like a 5-year old would get naughty in a school concert rehearsal. This is highlighted in the songs. There seems to be no instructions at all. The choreography seems to be reserved for the action sequences where you can see the actors trying to remember the next step. This is certainly one of those films that you can't really complain about. Because with every complaint the voice in the head either goes, ""What were you expecting!?"" or, ""Why bother?""    ]"
846,"[Some antics are best left to Tom &amp; Jerry. That kind of violence is just not funny when humans do it, especially when set in a really long Ekta Kapoor soap opera. Yep, Golmaal Returns is that bad!What's with this trend of having half the dialogues referring to another movie/ TV show? Every other scene has one such reference here with Sanjay Leela Bhansali taking the worst hit. How many more movies are going to do this? Is our creativity limited to laughing at another's expense? Which could have been grudgingly acceptable were it done at least a little less crudely. Like in Golmaal, Tusshar Kapoor's mute character comes as a welcome relief in the midst of all the screaming and yelping. And he is the only one who managed to make me laugh. And then that too became repetitive. Women, as we are supposed to expect, are mere eye candy and to be referred to as the men's property. Jealousy is just about the only emotion they are allowed. It almost felt like these particular women were cast only to balance off the men in the looks department. I see no other reason for casting Celina Jaitley with Shreyas Talpade and Amrita Arora with Arshad Warsi. The Ajay Devgan-Kareena Kapoor pair is alright in an Omkara but here it just feels like a complete mismatch. Especially when Kareena behaves all insecure about Ajay's faithfulness. And don't even get me started on how badly placed and picturized the songs are. And they sound awful too.The silver lining to this dark, dark cloud is that I completely enjoyed the transitions used to put together two scenes. So much so that I began waiting for the scene to end, so I could see how they are going to move on to the next one. Of course, that was not the only reason I wanted scene after scene to end, but nevertheless credit given where it is due. So, how many of you would see a movie just for its transitions?There's this scene towards the end where each member of the cast walks towards a noose hanging down a tree threatening to commit suicide. Now, three cheers to that one!]"
847,"[EMI certainly touches upon a very relevant issue in the society today. And though it showcases the concerns in the cities, it is pertinent in the interiors of the country too. It is also hilarious at regular intervals. Especially Mohan Joshi's drunken scene. And what with Sanjay Dutt doing what we know him to do best - deliver dialogues in Mumbai-underworld fashion and time his lines perfectly. The other actors are barely bearable - with Malaika Arora's existence taking first place. So, the general idea and some of the details are right. But the individual stories chosen, which started off interestingly, became too sappy for my taste. And the other actors are barely bearable. The set-up of the stories, the reasons why the various characters take their loans and how they are unable to repay them is quite interesting. A different aspect is touched upon in each story. The plan for the recovery process is cute too, but the actual act is childish. And the final resolutions are so tacky and hurried that all the set-up seems like a complete waste. Also, it came across as if the writers were confused on what the purpose of the story was - was it to narrate how these four people went through the process of taking, defaulting and repaying their loans, or was it to showcase the transition of a person from the mafia? In trying to do both they had to deal with 5 plots which not only was too much taken on the plate but also lengthened the movie a bit much.Cinema as a source of education is taken way too seriously and yet the subject has been presented over-simplistically. And these put together actually undo what is actually entertaining in bits and pieces.]"
848,"[How many times have we complained that life is a rut, nothing new or exciting happens? Even if we've never made that complaint, there's always something that we'd really want to do but never got around to doing, because that needs a little more courage than to stay in our self-nurtured comfort zones. That broken relationship you wanted to mend, the hobby you wanted to pursue and for some of us unfortunately, it takes courage to just sit still enough to find that passion. Amar (Vinay Pathak) who's come to terms with the hand dealt to him is forced to push the self-imposed boundaries before he takes the final bow and says, Dasvidaniya - good bye. This pleasantly plump, obviously nerdy, on-the-wrong-side-of-30s, spineless simpleton makes you feel for him - not pity, but a certain affection. May he be blessed with death if that's what he really, really wants. And you gradually see him mending things in his life, sorting out and repairing the broken parts. You can sense his gradual liberalization as he achieves each item on his life's to-do list. Believe me, I get excited when I see Vinay on the poster of a movie. Post-Bheja Fry, I look forward to a movie featuring him because he has amazing versatility and convincing power. Here too, you can see Vinay's hardwork in every expression. And his prowess is proven more overtly when his alter ego shows up. The courage it must have taken for the makers to cast him as the lead is well rewarded by an overwhelming performance. And all other actors very efficiently provide form and shape to the world around Amar.Dasvidaniya is one of those rarities that bring a smile that refuses to go while a tear rolls down. The dark humor too helps in keeping that smile. And this is despite the leisurely pace at which things proceed. The story is not much more than a one-liner. But each character, however short-lived in the script, is given enough room to bloom and present its shades to us. Amar's response to each character is recorded with finesse. And thus every relationship brings with it a unique chemistry though each one of them is equally warm. Even animosity carries a tender feeling with it.The ever-demanding nature of human beings is very obviously put forth by Amar's ever increasing list. It tells something about ourselves when every time an item is checked off the list there are a few unchecked ones glaring at you. And as you see that, you find Amar taking a pause to just stand and stare - something that brings him immense pleasure. Why wait for the end to knock at your door? Go ahead, make your list. What will it have? That trip to the mountains? The adventure sport that you might not make if a few more years go by? That call you have been avoiding thus far? Whatever they may be make sure there's enough room for ""stand and stare"" on that list.]"
849,"[James Bond is back in possibly the most intense and flawed portrayal ever of the character and actor Daniel Craig does a good job of it. For those who watched Casino Royale, the story would make sense as this is a sequel, for others it would be a bit difficult to swallow.The standard additives for the mix perfected over the years are in place; chases involving boats, cars and aero planes, beautiful women who can love and fight at the same time, alluring locales, a global conspiracy, and well tailored suits.So what is it about this Bond?For one, this Bond is taking things personally; he is seeking vendetta and the country be damned.  Daniel Craig's Bond has his blemishes; he is running hard and does not know whom to trust.  The portrayal here is not tongue in cheek, neither is it played out as a super hero.  There are moments in the film when Bond opens up and shows affinity as a fellow human being for other characters; these moments are few and far in between, but they are there.  No wise cracks, no memorable quips as he dispatches the villains, his business here is dirty, forthright, and all too human.Two, M's role has been fleshed out in far more detail than other films; Dame Judi Dench is superb and demonstrates an almost maternal concern for her errant agent.Three, the villain is an ordinary human being, with no special prosthetic devices or physical abnormalities to mark him out as the Devil incarnate: Mathieu Amalric's big, big eyes convey his lunacy, and megalomaniacal ambitions. The pace is relentless; the film opens with a car chase, carrying on from where Casino Royale left off.  The cinematography is all sepia and gray, with no bright colours in keeping with the title sequence and the overall theme of the plot.  The plot jumps from country to country in fanciful leaps and through it all we have Bond keeping pace.The editing is fast and fractured, and leaves the viewer disoriented in the action scenes, especially in the opening sequence.  There are no grand explosions, nor spectacular stunts; the end has the mandatory blow up of the villains' lair, but none of it is particularly impactful.  Possibly the director wants us to focus only on James Bond and his world which has been compromised by a personal relationship, and we do that as we look into Craig's blue, blue eyes as he runs, jumps, shoots, fights hand to hand, but also seeks help from those he once tortured. Marc Foster has helmed Finding Never land and Monster's Ball; two very different films.  Here he brings a brooding intensity to the whole exercise, a sort of cynical pointlessness to the notions of patriotism, love, and death.  Paul Haggis's script does not really make sense in terms of logic, but holds up well under the demands of possibly the longest lasting action blockbuster franchise in movie history.  Betrayal is the thread which holds it all together. References are present with respect to earlier Bond films; a woman agent killed by painting her body with oil (in Gold finger it was gold paint), and an aerial dogfight (You only live twice).  The famous Bond Gun Barrel sequence appears only at the end and the theme song is a mix of hip hop and breathy funk. (No operatic music here).What will we get in the next installment, James Bond as a physically fit, skilled in combat, George Smiley with an insatiable need to understand one's existence and purpose?  A post modern Bond without a centre (a theme which comes up in this film) running only on instinct, and a script resembling some of the noirish Coen Brothers' films?I wait.]"
850,"[When you hear Salman Khan saying, ""Ram jaisa bhai"" (a brother like Lord Ram) your reflex action is to rub your eyes and check if you entered a Rajshri Productions' film by mistake. But then all this while the eyes were witnessing a Sanjay Leela Bhansali set-up. So, a Hindi film enthusiast should be all set to get dazed and dazzled. The advantage to this though is that in contrast the story and characters are as simple as can be.You know what simple means, right? Black and white. And eventually black turns white. Sure there are a couple characters like the lawyer (Mithun Chakravorty) and the maternal uncle (Anjan Srivastav) that make you wonder if they are black or white for a bit. But then you lose interest. The writers clearly want me to take sides, but don't give me enough details to be bothered.Neither can I be made to really care about the main characters. 2 out of the 4 (Salman Khan and Zayed Khan) are losers - and sore ones at that. One is eye candy trying out her emoting skills - that would obviously be Katrina Kaif. That lady is certainly at her elegant best, though.  And the only one who was worth watching, for his supposedly autistic behavior, Anil Kapoor has very little screen time.Now, a simple wiki search tells you that autism is ""is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication"". But our man is social enough to lecture his beloved uncle on family values. And he has befriended children and adults who have bothered to interact with him. Not to mention he has grown appropriately in his flirting capabilities. Ok, we shall not hold story-writers responsible for the big words they off-handishly throw our way. Please, can we have them write a decent, engrossing story? The Archie-Veronica angle and her rich dad spouting exaggerated insults at him is yawnnnn. It's a musical extravaganza madam, you expect the wrong things all the time.Now that is one thing Yuvvraaj cannot be accused of - lacking in the song and dance department. I actually enjoyed listening to the songs, barring ""aaja main hawaon mein"". And for being distracted during that one, I can actually blame the phobia I have for animated petals after Drona. The way the other songs were picturised did have a broadway musical feel to them,  and this was ratified by an all out replication of the makeup from the CATS musical. BUT, stick to that. Please don't have Salman Khan talk to Beethoven. Anyway, we could have done with a lot less of familial blah-blah. That would also help in reducing the length that is stretched to almost 3 hours.]"
851,"[Skip the italicized bits to read review. The italicized bits are my thoughts on the on-going war in Mumbai interspersed in between the review.Over 40 hours since the country has been held hostage. Each one of us hostage to TV channels, internet reports, or twitter and some of us hostages inside the Taj, or The Oberoi or Nariman House.  Each one either scared or worried or angry or frustrated or some combination thereof. But each one of us helpless. What can we do? Abuse the government, opposition, media? Did that and got bored within 20 minutes. What else can I do? The only thing I can think of is to panic as little as possible and continue the routine. So here I am doing what I do every Friday. Trying, albeit unsuccessfully, to ignore what's happening 150kms away, trying to keep my angst on the world outside from making a judgment on the world inside the dark, secure(?) cinema hall. Bold themes and atypical resolutions are fascinating. And this time around Onir explores relationships in detail - the love angle, the love triangle, the husband-wife, the parent-son. Unexpectedly though, the brother-brother relationship is left half-baked, even untouched. Yet, there is enough in there to keep you engrossed and wonder, what next?The basic premise, the love triangle, takes you through the confusion of the mature characters. There's no beating around the bush. The characters all behave like a normal person in that situation would. The second premise feels like it is right out of a Mahabharat side-story that made it to an Amar Chitra Katha comic of its own. Boons and curses. And then the inevitable loophole or way-out of the curse. It was comical too, but very contemporary. At one point I actually thought Shabana Azmi was going to pull a KuntiMaybe I'm just seeing war where there isn't any...Sharman Joshi is just awesome as the unsure guy who is torn-between-two ideologies. Chitrangadha Singh looks ravishing and convinces us that she's one confused woman. Boman Irani as the daddy cool, and Shabana Azmi as the mom wanting to fit in with the new generation, are used more as comic relief. But they fill the screen with life even when they are taunting or angry. The chemistry this cute, oldie couple shares makes you want to be like them, when you are older.I want to grow old. I don't want to die today. I want lessons on how to be that sarcastic mom-in-law...Of course, the witty lines - funny or otherwise - help every one set the right mood throughout the movie. Your heart might not reach out to any single character, because none of them want to do the ""right thing"". But, except for Harry's (Sanjay Suri's) exaggerated selfishness, the situations are real enough for us to keep judgment at bay too. Each character seems right in their confined space. And the lines get blurry, as they always do, as you add in external factors - people or situations. This is one of those movies I'd watch again when I'm in a less agitated frame-of-mind. If not for the unusual storyline and climax, as a study of characters.Yes, the situation has improved and the mind feels more relaxed now...gotten used to it? Already??Stay safe!!]"

So, there's this thief, Lucky and he does what he enjoys doing best - stealing. So, he starts off as an insolent youth stealing, he steals as he grows. Then steals some more. And repeat. There is no high point in the drama that makes me curious about the end. feel like sending a text message out to see if the drama in the real world seems any closer to an end.Of course, he steals cars and carpets and all things expensive. But he also steals teddy bears, greeting cards, and family photographs. Fine. He does it with finesse, charm, and presence of mind. In fact, the ease with which he steals is ""almost"" unbelievable.Well, if a city can be set on fire so easily, then...Now the promos claim that he steals your hearts too. Uh...no...Well, Abhay Deol, the actor's, dimples are cute. But there is only so much he can do within the confines of what Lucky, his character allows him to do. He's smug, doesn't take life too seriously and has an arrogant sense of humor that keeps a smile on your face through the two hours. this is weird, I'm smiling and yet my eyes go misty every time I think, Mumb...Three cheers to the dialogue writer...Though, of course, the point of the movie is not to make us laugh. It is to tell a story. Of this man who is so endearing that you supposedly don't mind him stealing - Bunty and Babli style. But the story doesn't tug your heart. I see no reason why the police should get all pal-ly with Lucky.or maybe I've just gone numb. After all, I'm in this theater watching a movie on this day of terror...there you go Mr. Terrorist, I won't get terrorized, I'm desensitized now! BOOHOO to you!!! There is this subtle comment on how an otherwise insensitive guy is completely bowled over and gullible when he's treated as family. And this because he has had a troubled childhood because of his family. It also comments on the media-mania. In fact the official site has director, Dibakar Bannerjee saying -It's also inspired by crime reportage in the new shining India. ... crime is fun, it's good TRP.Ouch! What timing...I'm sorry guys, I'm going to cop out of this one...the plot  doesn't hold much water; it is a smart-ass comedy with decent actors who have wonderful accents. I need a story or a good narrative that engrosses, didn't get either.Stay safe...]"
853,"[Each life has a story - boring as it may be but there's a story. Dil Kabaddi chooses 2 couples going through the 2/4-year itch (7 y\ears is way too long) to display the one issue that causes it - boredom. The basic disinterest in what the other finds interesting leads to this boredom. And underneath the boredom, you might chance upon layers of confusion about what one wants from life. All these complexities in a relationship are explored only through the lens of sexuality.Sexuality is addressed so directly that there's no room for innuendos. It's so direct that it is refreshing considering how the topic is taboo in Indian society. And yet it does not shock. You begin discussing your relationship in your head, just as the couple on screen discusses its own when their friends have a fight.The situations seem very close to urban relationships in real life - simple but complicated because of the need for complications, so satisfied that each one needs its own mix of masala to keep it alive. Or maybe the simplicity and satisfaction are just an illusion behind which the characters have found cozy corners. The movie does get out of a generic Hindi movie's comfort zone by given each of its women characters an identity of their own and men displaying their insecurity.Over the period of the two hours, we are fully aware of each character's sexual needs but don't get much of a peek into their emotional ones. Their need for companionship, compatible companionship is a given. Something that supposed doesn't require any explaining. And this is where I was left thirsty. I wanted to know them better, the gray characters that they were. But, I was denied that.And this despite wonderful portrayal of confusion, frustration, and indecisiveness by all - Irrfan Khan, Soha Ali Khan, Rahul Bose and Konkona Sen Sharma. Together they help maintain the light vein in which the seriousness is handled. Case in example would be Soha Ali Khan thinking of paint colors for her room while in bed with her husband as if she was in an ad with her real-life brother.The light-heartedness is equally attributed to the background music. Just like the music composer seems to be in love with his ensemble and what he can do with it, I fell in love with the music. As if it were flirting with the mood of the characters without once getting overbearing.My biggest complaint is the sense of discontent that I leave the theater with. Of course, I'm not asking for back-story, thank goodness they didn't give any of the characters any. I'm asking to know a little more about the characters - their aspirations not just sexual fantasies, their need for company not just lust. And there was enough room for this since each scene seemed to be stretched to exaggerate the situaion, the camera lingering around a little longer than need be for me to grasp the situation. Even if it is something as interesting as cheating on a spouse.Extra-marital relationships seem like the flavor of the season. Dil Kabaddi has focused on one aspect of any romantically-inclined relationship,  picked 3-4 types of characters of each gender, and mixed them up in different permutations to make perfect soap-opera. Yep, I managed to squeeze all the juice out of various interesting angles that the above medley can have. Now, what if I tell you, the 'one' aspect of relationships chosen is 'sex'? The juice is back, right? Not entirely but enough to make you sit through. Because, it's interesting to see people make the most of their mundane lives.]"
854,"[Maharathi serves more as a slap on the face of all those people who use Paresh Rawal, Boman Irani and even Om Puri in mindless slapstick. And rightly so. These men are capable of so much more than the average script they take up. Alas, the thriller doesn't chill the spine.The anxiety doesn't build-up because each frame is given that little extra time to linger, each character that extra moment to make roots in our minds, each actor that extra moment to shine. Except in that one-off case, the senses are stimulated and then given a breather which kills the suspense. Also, I find the thrillers that go back-and-forth-and-back-again very tiring. Not because I have to keep track of the turn and re-turn of the events, but because it gives a feeling of 'we are trying to hard to thrill you, you better sit on the edge now.' To add to this, only one aspect of each character is exposed to screen. The others we are either blind to or left half-baked. So when you don't know if the scheming mind himself wants the loot or not, you wouldn't know who to root for. Sure, you don't always need someone to cheer, ok, give me someone to get frustrated with, angry at.Yet, when you see Naseerudin Shah, Paresh Rawal, and Boman Irani fill the screen in tight close-ups taking this one chance to show their mettle you want to forgive everything. It's as much credit to them as it is to Neha Dhupia that she can stand tall before them and treat their characters as trash (the way its intended to).And yet, a movie with such talent (even if you keep Neha Dhupia out of the equation) at its disposal and them living up to it too, cannot evoke any kind of emotion, is rather disheartening. Moreover, at it heart, the premise arouses a good deal of curiosity. So, maybe, that extra something they went for through a-moment-longer-than necessary pauses, caused the damage.]"
855,"[God resides within us, we just need to check. ORGod is dead, it doesn't really matter how we behave. ORGod exists and he is happy/unhappy based on what we do/don't do. ORGod exists but won't help us unless we help ourselves. ORWhatever!!? Who cares?Each of the above value systems and more are represented by one or more characters in Raaz. Makes for interesting debate? Yes, but loses direction too, since it'd take some real skill to articulate things when you are taking on so many points of view.Sure, there is a definite side that the movie ultimately takes, but some of the beliefs portrayed are scary. Not because of the appropriately used background music and sound design, or the jump-in-your-seat horrific visuals. But, because they are just so inhuman. I doubt all the makers subscribe to that way of life. But, I guess they do believe that the idea of inhumanity sells. And you know what the irony is? One of the characters is shown in bad light because he ""sells"" stories based on his campaign against superstition.Anyway, getting out of all the theo-talk, so many types of characters ultimately leads to mega-confusion and also leaves each one of them pretty uni-dimensional. More so because pre-interval the characters and their situations take their own time to develop. And suddenly post-interval a host of new characters are introduced and obviously each one of them is vying for attention.The plot that develops in the second half along with its sub-plots is interesting but the resolution is far from satisfactory. Usually unexplained issues increase the intrigue and I like them because they keep me thinking even after I've left the hall. But Raaz's climax feels like, ""so much hoo-hah for this?"" When they provide you with each line to join dots and leave one out so blatantly, it comes off more as a loophole than a 'point to ponder about'.Mohit Suri, like always got me curious with the intense opening sequence. But it instantly infuriated me because of this piece I read a couple of days ago. How could they ask for any censor certificate other than 'A'?! I'd hate to see any child watching some of the visuals in the movie. Not to get very excited peoples, these are not X-rated visuals - these are just the kind that make you squirm and wait for the scene to get over.However, there's Kangna Ranaut. So, there's enough skin-show too. She does well with her screaming scenes. What's interesting is that while I don't feel for her character, she does make me pray that I'm never in her position. I didn't identify with her character. But it made me go, ""hell, I don't want to see the things she's seeing!"" The director-actor duo seem to have done well together, because we've seen her do similar stuff earlier. She does look ravishing on the ramp too - but that too we've seen earlier.Adhyayan needs to start at the basics - let's work on dialogue delivery to start with, get me interested as an audience. And till then DO NOT dance, please. Emraan Hashmi always makes a sincere effort. Since, the requirement for expressions is only bewilderment and care, he can't do much. But, at least he now has bagged the two.An opening title card preaches Sant Kabir's doha asking us to look within ourselves before pointing fingers. The protagonist learns that the hard way. But the connection between what she goes through and why is very flimsy. Not to mention, what the movie tries to convey is the opposite of what I believe in. Yet, I also believe in respect for the opposite view. So, while I didn't agree with the stand taken, I didn't mind watching it and getting a wee bit terrified along with it too.]"
856,"[There are very few times that you go to watch a movie and you get to smile, feel sad, excited, dreamy and fall in love all at the same time. Slumdog Millionaire gives you all that and much more. In a unique setup the movie is so close to real life and at the same time takes you on a fantasy flight.It's fast paced and touches upon big issues (like poverty, slums, religious riots, beggars of Mumbai, young criminals) in bits but still succeeds in making a huge impact on the viewers. The brilliantly shot chase sequence at the start sets you right into this fast moving story. The brilliant background music sets the tone for rest of the journey. I loved the way Hindi is used in the start of the movie to bring the authentic experience for the viewers.Smart use of background score helps you in shifting to completely different scenarios with ease. There are very few movies that can make you feel the pain, joy and emotions as the scenes flip by but Slumdog Millionaire does that with simplicity. The work put into making the movie be it script, story, screenplay or the music shows. All of this has been backed by excellent direction and brilliant acting by everyone. I tried hard to find a weak character in the movie but failed.Though it walks through some of the most complex situations yet it is a very simple movie and I believe that is what you would experience while watching it. The switch from Hindi to English comes as a bump on a road but again you are eased through the change with help of good background music. And for those who think that an illiterate kid on Indian streets cannot speak English you surely haven't been to Mumbai. The climax will give you a heightened sense of achievement, winning, content, sacrifice and excitement; and just like the rest of movie, all at the same time!Director Danny Boyle has pulled of an absolute peach of a movie. I am sure Co-Director Loveleen Tandan has helped him in capturing the right kind of Mumbai setup for the movie, which is the essence of the story. Another thing that makes Slumdog Millionaire a unique experience is the brilliant screenplay, thanks to Simon Beaufoy. All the actors look in control of their character be it Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Tanay Chheda or the kids Azharuddin and Ayush. Anil Kapoor pulls off his role brilliantly. Remember he was supposed to fill in the shoes of Amitabh Bachhan and Shahrukh Khan as game show host, but then he twists it around and adds his own touch to the character. Convincing you that being in Bollywood for more than 2 decades he knows his business. The real star of the movie is A R Rahman with his superb background score especially the pieces ""O Saya"" and ""Latika's Theme"" which you will end up humming long after the movie is over.Thinking about the movie on my way back to home I was caught up in confusion if it is a movie about dreams, hope, sore relations, the reality of life of a slumdog or is it about the luck of a random boy. I am convinced that it is about all that but more than that it is about love. Yes it is a love story.]"
857,"[President Bush has provided us with loads of entertainment over the last eight years. So what if they were with headshakes-in-despair.  Six Indians who represent the other billion of us wait for a handshake-in-desperation with THE man in The President is coming. It is as much a comment on our obsession as a nation with the American dream - love it or hate it - as it is about the nation who chose this man twice to lead their nation! A Math nerd, a farmer, a stockbroker, a wannabe-Paris-Hilton, an accent trainer and a leftist novelist - are all motivated to meet President Bush on his visit to India. If that wasn't diversity enough - one of them is a South Indian, one a hardcore Maratha, another a Gujrati, then a Bengali and two ""better-exposed"" city-bred youngsters. You can imagine the amount of fun this medley can cause all thanks to of course - stereotyping. And they do it largely without slapstick!! Filled to the last bit with sarcasm, The President is coming is consistent with the typecasts it initiates. It's not satire for the sake of satire. The characters are all someone you might've met - at work, in family, amongst friends, friends of friends. Which is why it is charming and the humor keeps you engaged. At no point is it rolling-on-the-floor-laughing, but I found myself snickering throughout. Yeah, in many ways it makes you feel good about yourself - Like you are not one of them, though they have been chosen to represent you - the youth of India - to a foreigner.Each character is also the extreme of the stereotype it represents, almost on the border of exaggeration, but you know it's not. The writer takes you to the brink of a believable character and very smartly stops. Yet, a lot of the plot is contrived. And I'm not even talking of the basic premise. There are tangents that the movie goes off on which are kind-of to exhibit a character's quirk. But, since 8 characters are being squished together in 90 minutes, many of these remain half-baked.And yet, the movie is enjoyable like a sitcom. Enjoy the now of the joke. And this is possible because of some awesome casting. From the guy who plays the geek from Bengalooru to the possibly-illiterate stockbroker. Needless to say you can laugh only if the dialogues are bright and they are timed well. And this combination occurs often enough.It is one of those that you see on a lazy Sunday afternoon when you are in the mood for something light and when you are done you forget it. No more and no less.]"
858,"[I can imagine Zoya Akhtar taking notes every time she saw a person from the industry behave in a ""typical"" industry manner. She then smoothened out the edges of these rough mental sketches, deepened them ever-so-slightly, gave them a thick outline and ta-da...script ready. That's the Einstein-moment when she realized she needed a story. Damn! Back to the storyboard to weave all these characters together into a coherent plot. If it were left to her, she'd have been very happy to just continue playing around with her characters and their peculiarities for a couple more hours without ever getting to their story. And she'd have done well too.That's not to say that she didn't do justice to the story, it's just that it had nothing spectacular about it - a love story with gray characters most of whom are ambitious. And she does tweak the simple storyline a bit too. And those tweaks might not make the movie very popular but I enjoyed them the best. The foreground of Mumbai's filmy world has all the cliched elements any movie based on the industry could be expected to have. And yet there's charm in all its characters. Rishi Kapoor is the industry stalwart and yet has his share of insecurities. Dimple Kapadia, a Diva in her era hasn't had enough fame and is intent upon continuing to live her aspirations through her daughter. Isha playing the daughter is almost clueless but knows her way around too.  Juhi Chawla's character enjoys her status in this world even if it is mostly in the name of a trophy-wife. All these ""stars"" in real life mixed with Manish Malhotra, Mac Mohan, Javed Akhtar, Shabana Azmi, Kareena Kapoor, Vivek Oberoi, Ranbir Kapoor, John Abraham, Abhishek Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan playing themselves. Anurag Kashyap aces the list, I couldn't resist giggling throughout his two scenes. Don't let this list bring back bad memories from Om Shanti Om though. Even if their cameos are to multiply the glamour quotient, there's a reason for them to be smartly woven in the movie and it's not just to shake a leg or two. This smartness runs as an undercurrent through the movie. It starts off with one of the very few non-Khans at the 'top' in the industry, Hrithik Roshan being named Zaffar Khan. Then we see him discussing a break from the mould he is set in as an actor...so he can work with Karan Johar. Farhan Akhtar's character, Vikram has been written with great thought too. The transitions he goes through are not perfunctory or a result of an inspirational one-liner. But, you can see the build-up towards the change. We see him get vulnerable-emotional and conniving-calculative. The credit goes as much to his growing talent as an actor as it goes to the way his character is written. On the other hand, I feel a little bad for Konkona Sen Sharma. Since she almost always picks well-written roles, this one seems like yet-another-well-written character. So even though she performs well and gets the nuances across it feels like 'What's the big deal? We know she can do that.'Yet in this medley of little good things there are stretches of ""got it, let's move on already!"" There are spans which have absolutely inane-quotes-from-an-email-forward dialogues. I suppose they are meant to inspire. But such lines almost always end up patronizing in a very annoying sort-of a way. The saving grace is that they are amidst some witty one-liners. Luck By Chance is the kind you can sit back and enjoy. And at the same time it keeps your gray cells at work. Not because of a powerful plot or any such thing. But more because the characters are thinking and talk like people do. So by any chance, if you miss it in the theaters make sure you catch it on DVD...only when it is officially out though ;) ]"
859,"[I love watching cricket. I love our batsmen. I love the veterans as much as the new blood. I love our spinners, and I love our pace bowlers. I love our fielding when we do it and abuse the misfielding more often than not. And yet I cannot make myself watch the rerun of a match. Even if we have won. Even if my favorite batsman has scored a century. Even if a bowler has broken a world record. Well, what can I say, I am that kind of a cricket-fan. Imagine my plight when I watch an entire movie match, where I know not only the result (duh! The name of the movie is 'Victory!!), but also know it ball-by-ball. Yes, it is that predictable!!Sure, the scriptwriting textbook says have a set-up, a conflict, and a resolution. But these guys seem to have taken it a tad too seriously. Each act is build up to a limit where even a novice in movie-watching can forecast the next step and the two after that. The same goes for the lame lines given to one and all. I agree we are a cricket-crazy country. But repeating - once every 5 minutes - how the entire nation, ONE BILLION of us are looking up at/down upon a cricketer or are excited about/disappointed with an outcome becomes just too much to handle.Considering the overall issues with the writing department, the actors have done one helluva job! Hurman Baweja has certainly come a long, long way from Love Story 2050. He can actually cry convincingly. Very few male leads manage to not look like comedians when they do that. Amrita Rao is comfortable in her usual homely, warm character. Though here she occasionally bursts into the inner voice of different characters and brings them to their senses. But, I really want to see her do something different. Wouldn't she want that too? Anupam Kher, of course, makes the most of lines that have we've heard over and over again in the past few decades. The pride of a father, the stoop in his shoulder, the agony, the anger, the frustration can only be credited to his years of experience.Its not like predictability is a sin. O-kay it is. But not an unforgivable one. But there have been movies which are beautiful despite committing that one. This one is not. Maybe, just maybe, it might have worked if it was an hour shorter. Or maybe not. ]"
860,"[""Look at me people, I am the star, who needs police protection"". ""Hey...even if you can't see me, you won't miss the star who offends politicians... that's ...ME!""Even if the credit rolls claim that Shah Rukh Khan's appearance in Billu is only incidental, each frame has a heavy Shah Rukh aftertaste along with posters and songs from almost all his movies. When he's not on screen, awe for his character (Sahir Khan) is persistently thrown around. And Sahir is so strinkingly similar to Shah Rukh that it's hard to think of him as Sahir. And this feels like you are having Shah Rukh for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. That is, you are choked up to your throat with the adulation for him. The boasting needs some serious toning down. Sure, modesty is for losers and kings don't need to be humble. Especially when humility is left to the other character, Billu. Yes, the story is about Billu - his diffidence, his friendship, his dignity. Irrfan plays it with such intensity that this simple, believable character gets me attached to him. Unfortunately, the attachment is not used any further. It just lays hanging out there for the most predictable thing to happen. This is the bane of a high-profile production house film. You know how it's going to end. So what's left to the writers is to engross you with how it gets there. No number of item numbers with superstars in bikini bras can replace the need for a strong conflict and a charming resolution. The climax does have its emotional peak but it gets there only after a few eye-rolls through a long, long spiel.  And it wouldn't have worked one-bit if it weren't for Irrfan's confused, dazed eyes. Just like the village-fool Billu, endears himself to you, the witty dialogues stick a smile on to your face for a good length of the first half. It begins to wear out slowly but never fades away completely. It does carry its share of sms-forward jokes but it's such a relief to see Priyadarshan restrain himself from the usual loudness his recent films carry. It also doesn't hover around side-issues and sticks to its very basic plot. He also comments on this star-struck nation we are. How we use this star-craziness to make our uninteresting life meaningful. And in this crowd there can be a simple person who is content with what he has. Yet the crowd won't let him live in peace. They'll make a hullaboo, create havoc, belittle him and make him doubt himself. We also have a potential answer to the recession. Get a movie-shoot going in every corner of the world. Not a bad idea! I, for one, will not complain. But, the down-to-earth character is surrounded not only by characters with superficial needs but also with artificial surroundings. The houses and other surroundings are painted and then color corrected/saturated to give a very synthetic feel to the already orchestrated frames. They take away from the otherwise possibly earthy look a film set in the interiors of the country could have carried. Though Lara Dutta as Billu's wife is convincing by her performance, she doesn't gel with the village milieu. Mostly because of the way she's dressed up. While a lot of it has to do with how differently her sari is draped from the other villagers, the almost-backless blouse is a certain giveaway. Even the supposedly-carelessly done hair looks composed. Anyway, you have Shah Rukh mocking himself and the films he works in, but lately we've seen him do that often enough. Who am I to doubt that an entire village can go crazy with a film actor showing up in their vicinity? I'll buy that. But don't choke me with it. ]"
861,"[An unsolved mystery in real life has so many potential climaxes. Our imagination is the only limitation. Writer-director Manish Gupta's imagination brings us his plausible solution to the unresolved case of the stoneman murders in the 80s and it's an interesting one too. Only that it has hiccups in the form of drama. That slight over-dramatization that gives the audience a couple minutes to think and makes the shocker twist into an ""I knew it!"" victory moment for them.In general, every time a protagonist finds himself in a corner with very little room to escape it makes us want to root for him even harder. And you sense the claustrophobia when doors slowly start closing in on Sanjay (Kay Kay Menon). Fingers being pointed at him, an unhappy wife, a senior who might just be using him as a means to an end, a colleague who's out to get him, a junior who's not completely in-sync with him - all stars aligning themselves just right to make life miserable for him. The writing is actually reasonably gripping. It has its twists, turns, and re-twists that fit into the short run-time. But it needs more meat for the other characters. The wife, the colleague - could have been delved more into. We are allowed nowhere close to the killer's psyche. Then again, that might not be the point of the movie. Also the language used is extremely inconsistent and distracting. A character who speaks Hindi with a very heavy Bombay dialect suddenly spouts a phrase in chaste Hindi.  Most of the dialogue delivery is left in Kay Kay's safe hands and usually that's a good thing. He starts out as his usual exceptional self. It's a delight to see his composure change from attentive-submissive when he's with his boss to bossy-smug when ordering around his subordinates. And then suddenly it gets weird. He delivers his lines in a staged way which I just couldn't associate with him - the distant look in the eyes while mouthing some really bad lines. Rukhsar (Sanjay's wife) looks very out-of-place all through. Her attire - the way the cotton sari is draped and the way she's carrying it don't go together at all. Her character's sub-plot has no connection with the rest of the story. I have this creeping suspicion that she's here because she was the only one ready to shed her clothes for that one unnecessary scene and fit the budget!! You'd think that it's a thriller and has given itself only 95 minutes so they'd be in a rush. But, na-ah...the camera takes its time to scan the room and the characters. Usually, I enjoy slow camerawork, it gives me time to soak in the atmosphere but here it is very random and rather directionless. Not to mention, the typical thriller-violin-shrieking in the background. I'd have voted for a tighter screenplay. And since it's a short film in the first place, maybe a few minutes to delve into the psyche of the other characters would have made my experience more complete. ]"
862,"[Positioned as a prequel to the Underworld movies, Underworld - Rise of the Lycans is tedious viewing.  This movie is about the origins of the conflict between the Vampires and Werewolves (Lycans) and has nothing new to offer in terms of visuals, storyline, and special effects.  The first film Underworld appeared nearly five years ago, and it was all about watching Kate Beckinsale in smoking hot leather, beat the stuffing out of whomever.  This film unfortunately holds no such attractions.The actors are old faithfuls who have appeared in the previous two Underworld movies, and they continue to reprise their roles.   Bill Nighy is the Vampire patriarch, all fancy brocaded jackets, blue irises, and a powdered pale face.  He believes that his dialogues should be earth shaking (or was that the director's instructions?), and so makes sure he spits his words out and for effect tries to vibrate his jowls simultaneously.Rhona Mitra is comely enough as Sonja and Michael Sheen is sufficiently gaunt and expresses his tender emotions through his eyes (the viewer is alerted to this fact through another character, in case he or she missed it completely). Kate Beckinsale appears for two seconds at the end of the film since this film is a prequel and the story does not have her in it yet.   The rest of the cast have nothing much to do in the film: they look uninterested; in some shots of the prisons the extras (who play prisoners) look completely confused and befuddled.(or was that just the touch of realism that this film demanded?)The film has the age old themes of forbidden love, the fight of the underdog against injustice (literally in this case, since dogs are descended from wolves!), and the climactic big fight.  The film is visually all grey and black and we have swordplay, acrobatic fights in the rain, lots of carnage with necks and limbs being sawed off with monotonous regularity, tomato juice blood, and hirsute werewolves aplenty.  But it is all been done before a thousand times and one just wants the whole thing to get over fast.  Unfortunately the screen play does not help; it makes sure that things are stretched till the limit of predictability until so called justice has been done to all the ingredients in the pot.The film feels like the director has been given a job to do, a job which is as routine as pouring milk into a bowl of cereal and he has gone ahead and done it, without bothering to think too much about it.The production values are decent, the castle, the towers, and the cliffs look real enough, but the special effects at times with respect to the creatures, look bedraggled.  And that is ironic, considering that this prequel is directed by a gentleman who specializes in creature effects!This is a vapid film; one of those standardized products that studios are so good at fabricating, for an audience consisting of die hard fans.  The film is not able to beget a single lump in the throat, nor nary a tear in the eyes of the viewer.  One just sinks deeper into the seat and wonders how one has landed up watching it. Best avoided, unless one wants to pay up for a few yawns.]"
863,"[...And a strange pestilence spread over the land and the people were troubled.  Their laments reached the ears of the old king who was then sorely beset.  The noble king grew weary and thought ""Is there not within the bounds of this kingdom, a champion, a mighty Knight who would rid the land of its scourge? And if not, May the Gods perchance send us one such?""...  It has been years since Hollywood served up a good, hearty, sword and fantasy epic.  The eighties were full of them what with the likes of Conan The Barbarian and other low budget imitators.  Director Howard McCain takes a plot that is as old as the hills, incorporates a new twist, and gives us a film which is surprisingly enjoyable.  A similar film called The Thirteenth Warrior starring Antonio Banderas appeared in the 1990's directed by John McTiernan (who also gave us Predator and Die Hard).  Outlander's plot includes elements from both Predator and The Thirteenth Warrior but the treatment is significantly different.  Outlander stresses more on the human relationships that exist between the characters; the themes of Belonging and Acceptance, family, community, honour, friendship, loyalty and chivalry are all nicely brought out.  This is not to say that the film eschews action; but the director seems to have struck a neat balance between the fights and the human relationships with all the dexterity of a high wire artiste.  John Hurt is suitably beleaguered and noble as the old King Rothgar and Sophia Myles is his fair daughter, Freya.  James Caviezel is lean, stubble jawed, and has black short hair; the clear Outlander amongst the long haired, blond Norsemen. Caviezel's portrayal of a character lacerated by guilt and suffering is expressed through his blue eyes and minimal speech.  His acting is surprisingly good given the fact that he is the Hero in an action adventure film! (maybe all the practice that he had from The Passion of the Christ has stood him in good stead!)  Ron Perlman appears in a small cameo as a twin axe wielding warrior and looks mean enough.  And how could one forget the Creature?  The special effects are great, and the Beast is as good as any as we have seen on the screen, all hell fire, fangs, and whip lashing tail.  The screen play elicits chills, spills, and emotional highs from what is otherwise a very predictable plot.  The climax too is gradually built up, with a sudden twist at the end, and when we think that yes it is all over, it is not yet time to leave.  The film has a message too, of a very topical and contemporary kind.  Outlander is a film that utilizes all the elements of its genre: a lovely heroine, a fierce and most potent Beast, a lonely Hero, and a band of unlikely comrades.  It is quite enjoyable because the director has taken care to add a certain minimal depth to the main characters and to blend in themes of Hubris, Loss and longing as well as Fate and Free Will.  Sit back and enjoy.    ]"
864,"[A travelogue of a tourist on vacation capturing his experience through recordings and pictures. A personal diary - each page an observation about life and its people. Angst against everything that's wrong with this world. A mirror held up to society - not to reflect its filth but to spot that we are the cause and effect of our discontent and discord. What is Delhi-6? A bit of them all. And not any one thing in entirety.It's not the journey of a non-resident Indian visiting India. You see the world through his eyes. It's not about one particular pin (zip) code area. It is a slice of any town. It is not about a religious divide nor is it about unity. All of which translates to this - it doesn't have a story in the traditional sense of the term. This is the beauty of the film. Even the main characters are not really full-blown protagonists. You know them slightly more than you know the other 15 side-characters. Without a concrete story it very gradually creates an appealing environment. But at half-time, you are still in the ""okay, NOW the movie will start"" mode. This can be a frustrating experience unless you give yourself up to the edgy-choppy style of story-telling. In fact, the first two distinct and abrupt sequences tell you to prepare yourself for 2-3 threads and to draw parallels between them. And analogies there are aplenty. Some of them are as in-the-face as they are sudden. The abrupt cuts and background music, though brilliant, were too distracting for me to let go completely. I felt like I'm snooping in on somebody's daily journal and it felt mighty uncomfortable as if I'm intruding their privacy. Most of us are aware of the standard philosophy spouted through the movie. Yet, we can enjoy the understated way in which it is being told. Except in the end, that is. It's like the writers got anxious, ""what if the audience doesn't catch on to the subtlety?"" Let us spell it out for them: m-e-s-s-a-g-e. Very intentionally the writers are writing a book that doesn't necessarily have to be read back-to-back. You can flip open a page, read, digest or not, close and open at another random page. Like it doesn't matter to them that one thread is left unresolved.  Same goes for the songs and their abrupt placement. However, 'dafatan' is one of the best picturized songs I've seen in a long time. Not only because of the imagination and the technical creativity but also because it takes you into the character's mindset. He in turn, is representative of how we as a race want the best of all our worlds to come together. The details within each sequence, like dialogues, interactions are not ground-breaking but not fatal either. There are a few brilliant lines amongst the blah sexual innuendos. And by the way, just in case you Dilli-wallas or hard-core desis take offence, you are told often enough that you are good at heart, so just listen to that bit, ok? The undercurrent is more important - the contradictions, the double standards, the bickering, the human tendency to reconcile when in need. Brothers fight like cats. But when the need arises they can be a part of a community against ""outsiders"". Two communities fight. But when there is something that endangers both they can unite to conquer the deemed-common enemy. That which divides to rule can unite too, such is the extent of our inconsistencies. And this can be extrapolated to any other relationship or issue. Such comments on how things work today are strewn across the movie. The amused look Roshan (Abhishek Bachchan) wears on his introduction to India was extremely heartening. It was neither demeaning nor patronizing. Abhishek isn't required to do anything out of the ordinary, but overpowering the likes of Waheeda Rahman must certainly not have been an easy task. As much credit to Waheedaji especially in that particular scene for succumbing to the situation. Sonam Kapoor has a charming screen presence and makes the best of the limited range this role offers. The best bit of casting is Atul Kulkarni though. I for one wanted to see him in a not-so-serious role. He captures Gobar's submissiveness and hypocrisy.Such movies are made with the intention of evoking the audience's inner voice. That's a tall order. Lectures pass   right through my 4-year old's entire system, so I'd conclude we are conditioned to ignore them. Then, even if you have a character point out and say, ""don't sermonize us"", it doesn't make it any less of a speech. And that's where the director lost me as an audience. Nothing is moved to evoke emotion, let alone invoke anything from within. Equality-humanity-yadi-yada-yawwwwn. A little off-mark for the man who has given us radical climaxes - like them or not. The pace and length could be an issue for some of us. But, we shouldn't miss the fact that it is courageous to attempt a general description of life. I enjoyed the nuances, the hints, and the less blatant bits of commentary on society. That was enough for me to forget and partially forgive the need for a lucid three-act plot. ]"
865,"[An abused flat, visually so filthy that you can sense the stink it must carry. But, it must also feel like abundant luxury for someone just out of prison. The word 'prison' brings dark images to the mind even without the heavy bluish-gray tinge given to it in Siddharth - The Prisoner. These first few, short and lingering sequences bring on the mood of melancholy that doesn't go away. While soaking in these bits of Siddharth's (Rajat Kapoor's) newfound freedom you can't but help notice the background music. The keys of a typewriter tapping along to the notes of a piano. A string instrument joins later only waiting for the tinkering bell to make the rhythm complete. And the pause in the score while abrupt seems to be a part of the music itself. And soon the music becomes repetitive enough to blend with other elements and doesn't distract. A lot of being able to notice these details has to do with the minimal dialogues. There are long spans of dialogue-free movement. And yet somehow, you are tempted to think that there's something wrong with Mohan's (Sachin Nayak) righteousness. You are not surprised with how Amin (Pradip Sagar) and Aseem (Pradeep Kabra) interact and react. You are very aware of Siddharth's dilemma. And Siddharth puts to rest all my doubts about Rajat Kapoor's versatility. I was completely blown away by the way his body conveyed his thoughts. The rest, though not outstanding, don't make you doubt their behavior.Throughout the film, Hulla kept coming to mind. Maybe because the pace was similar and both had Rajat Kapoor. But somehow the brown hue and the desire to show the futility of our persistence and ambitions had the same taste and feel in both movies. Except in this one it worked for me. And yet there were phases in the movie where I could make a mental trip to the world outside that theater and come back. When that happens in a 90 minute film, it leaves a sense of incompleteness.The only way to liberate yourself is to let go. Let go of your attachments and your worldly needs. Our desires and thus our existence are in vain. The perceived 'purpose of life' is only a big sham. There is no breaking free from this tone of failure and dejection that runs heavy through the movie. As there are no conclusions to such thoughts. Then why should the movie that deals with them offer closings? To me having no resolutions is better than having hurried ones, and contrived ones are worse.If you're the kind of person who sees a person walking out of a prison and absolutely has to know why he was in, this one is not for you. If you like your movies nicely tied up in the end, skip it for your own sake. If you like it gift-wrapped and presented in your hands, Siddharth - The Prisoner will be a 'must skip' for you. Me? Well, I enjoy my abstractly beautiful and beautifully abstract films as much as the well-thought-out masala ones, so I'd have hated to miss it.]"
866,"[The film opens with black clouds roiling to a martial drum soundtrack and words appear on the screen indicating the historical period - Nazi Germany, 1944.  We then hear the sounds of soldiers / officers swearing an oath of loyalty to the Fuehrer, Adolph Hitler, which then fades out against the backdrop of the Nazi swastika.  These set the tone for what is to follow for the next two hours - a somber, sedate film which deals with a particularly interesting piece of German History during World War II.With Tom Cruise playing the pivotal character, one expects the film to have its share of stunts and explosions. Allies beating the bad guy Germans and winning.  Hollywood has been no stranger to such films, with such sterling examples like The Dirty Dozen, The Great Escape and Force 10 from Navarone.But no, this film is different.  What it does is to tell a story that involves dozens of assorted characters all of whom are drawn from the German army and have a common aim.  The plotting is complex, and in the first half an hour the film shifts between Africa, Russia, and Berlin and in the process introduces some of the key characters.  Tom Cruise plays Colonel Stauffenberg, a man dissatisfied with the state of affairs of the German nation.  Others soon appear: Kenneth Branagh as Major General Tresckow, Bill Nighy as General Olbricht, Tom Wilkinson as General Fromm, and Terence Stamp as Beck.  It takes some time for the screenplay to establish the main characters and their machinations, and then the plot begins to unfold.Director Bryan Singer recreates the period meticulously, never does one get the feeling that an anomaly exists.  The sets are detailed: Hitler's bunker, the offices of the German army, and the streets of Berlin are very well setup.  They look solid and very real and so do the uniforms.  In keeping with the fact that the characters are all senior officers in the German army, the acting is controlled, there are no ""applause"" provoking dialogues nor are there long declamations and pithy sayings.  The chief characters evince a quiet desperation as they go about their business; the strain is evident in the set of the jaw, the tightening of the mouth, or in some cases the innumerable cigarettes smoked.The screenplay does not make us understand the motivations of the characters clearly; things are never stated upfront and blatantly.  One gets the feeling that what is being done is in the interest of the German nation, at the same time some characters come across as ambivalent, or as sheer opportunists.  This is an area that the screenplay struggles with: for the audience to identify and empathise with the characters, a degree of clarity as to their underlying motivation is necessary.  The pacing of the film is unhurried at first, it picks up once the main characters are introduced, and then slows down again towards the end.  The end is in that sense an anticlimax, most viewers have at least some passing knowledge of the events depicted.  At the end, the viewer is left with a sense of futility at the turn of events depicted; a futility born out of foolhardiness that prompted so many men to risk their life for what is at best a nebulous idea( as it appears in the film).To his credit, the director does manage to compel the attention of the viewer, in spite of the weighty script and the variegated characters.  What suffers is the character development, an inevitable fallout of their sheer number, and the fact that he had to focus on the star, Tom Cruise.  Cruise turns in a suitably restrained performance, his jaw line and his carriage point to the bottled up tensions within.  The rest of the cast is good; Bill Nighy plays the man who teeters on the edge of indecision with panache.  Kenneth Branagh and Terence Stamp are more than adequate in their all too brief roles.  Tom Wilkinson is all bluster and jowl as the fence sitter.This is a film that avoids all manner of excess but it also is one that leaves the viewer wishing that it could have had more soul to it.]"
867,"[The Pursuit of Happiness (or was it Happyness?) was Director Gabriele Muccino's previous film that played on screens in India.  Ostensibly, it made a decent amount of money.  Mr. Muccino attempts to return to familiar territory, and this latest is called Seven Pounds.  It has Hollywood's most bankable African American star Will Smith (a thousand pardons, Lawrence Fishburne and Morgan Freeman) and proceeds to navigate the same terrain, that of the heart.(see the film and you will understand!) The script adopts the following structure: Will Smith's character, Ben Thomas is introduced; we see the actions that he carries out, actions that seem to make no sense at first.  We understand that there is something that he wants and needs, but the script gives no clues, barring a hint here and a hint there (though even an imbecile could piece it all together).At least that is how the scriptwriter and the director intended it, I assume.  The glorious resolution in the end, would in their understanding, leave the viewer with such a feeling of epiphany, that all else would pale before it.  Alack and alas, that is not how the film plays out.Will Smith is all angular and hollow eyed, and attempts a forlorn air, as he goes about his duties.  We see him playing God, with eyes that are brimming with unshed tears and a tattered air of desperation.  How good is his act? Woeful to say the least and woe betide the viewers.  His efforts to look miserable distress the audience.Ben enters into relationships with other people; the problem of the script is that in order to make sure that your heart is in the right place and that it is suitably moved, the director / script mandates that there be the most wonderful of human emotions (and a sure Box office magnet), Romantic Love,  present.  This development unfortunately feels too orchestrated and forced, and ensures that the film necessarily loses track of the other characters, except to show them for a minute or two.It is then Romance all the way, a very special romance.  We suddenly get to see a lot of honey golden frames; the two protagonists are framed in soft dewy light, and we have all the cliches that you can throw in - candles, the dinner, sweet gifts, the cute dog, and of course the bed.  All of it is very predictable; the script is just setting us up at that point.As Ben gets more and more desperate, so do we.  When will it end, possibly thinks Ben, and we could not agree more.    The time does come, thankfully, and the movie then wends its way into a climax so preposterous, that we would need a whole truck load of the good old fashioned liquid to recover.  And then come the tears, literally.  Everyone in the film cries and continues to cry in all sorts of places, to the accompaniment of a softly gurgling piano.  Having done this most noble deed, that is, bring the film to its ""logical"" conclusion, the director then bids us farewell.Should you watch it?  Yes, definitely, if you want to see an infinitely sad Will Smith in each and every frame.  You would also want to watch it, in case you are trying to make an impression on the sweet something next door, and show her that you are a person of refinement and deep sensitivity.  For the rest of us boors, best avoided.PS What was Woody Harrelson doing in this film?  Oh Tempera! (It is definitely not Oprah!)]"
868,"[""You are given the power to be the Almighty for 10 days of your life. What will you do?"" No, this is not a question in a beauty pageant, so you can actually do what you'd really like to do. My bet is that the first thing any normal person would do is to mend their life. And that's what our man, Arun Prajapati (Salman Khan) does too. So, in that sense, it is realistic. Yet, God tussi great ho comes across as aimless as it jumps from one sub-plot to another, and doesn't make any strong comment on human nature, the meaning of love, the state of politics or any of the things that it pretends to address. The quirky style of comedy between Salman Khan and Suhail Khan works in getting you to smile every once in a while. The kind of dialogue delivery that has these weirdly placed pauses in combination with zero body language, makes even the most serious scenes and situations look funny. Unintentionally funny of course. And even though it's not slapsticky 40 year olds behaving like they are 14 looks way too silly and out of place. This does manage to keep the drama quotient low, but so low that you don't feel for any of the characters in the emotionally charged scenes and it's a tad too high on stylizing the characters. Amitabh Bachchan, of course, lends grace and elegance to the movie in general. But, the movie requires him to hold a knowing smile all through. Nothing much can be done, because God after all can only smile at our follies. Priyanka Chopra, the main lead, squealed and jumped at the appropriate times. The sad thing is, her character was introduced as an intelligent person but then as the movie progressed, that introductory episode just seemed like it was there for the sake of letting us know that she's smart. That trait didn't come up anywhere later in the movie. The side-characters all seem very superficial - Mr. Prajapati Sr. (Anupam Kher), the Mrs., their daughter, their maid, a lottery ticket seller, a beggar, an office peon. They all have significant enough roles to have recall value, but none of them have the depth needed to make them believable. Anupam Kher made me laugh a couple of times but just didn't convince me of his middle class, government servant background. His wife too wore saris to suit her character but her body language and accent was that like of a socialite.So many characters translate to as many sub-plots. Since there isn't necessarily a direct connect with the main story, these side plots are just stuck together one after the other and give the movie a very jerky feel. It almost feels like the story was never written on paper, it was just narrated over a drink and finalized.The movie has a very dated feel overall. The sets, the songs and dances, the special effects don't look like they belong to the past 3-4 years of production. The special effects were a complete waste and most of it reserved for a shoddy, glitzy song. It'd have been so much better if the same money was spent on creatively creating the required effect on a set. Like Bruce Almighty, God tussi great ho doesn't fulfill its promising one-line plot idea. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that when God presents himself, you expect really great things to happen. But, they just don't.]"
869,"[So, Ram Gopal Varma wanted to scare and make us question our beliefs. Well neither happened. What did happen though was discovery of RGV, the deliverer of a 1000 laughs. Ok, we are fair around here - about 700 hundred of those cackles came in the first half. The rest were interspersed between a couple very strong scenes post-interval.Just in case you haven't guessed yet, there's nothing remotely scary about Phoonk. Unless of course, ogling crows, out-of-focus soft toys and wooden artifacts getting predictably into the limelight give you jitters. Then there's the heavily made-up Ashwini Kalsekar who has a fetish for charcoaled eyes. Unfortunately, even the 45 degree tilt in her head doesn't manage to evoke the fear factor. The spooky background music might have succeeded in some kind of horror, had it been used a little less than the entire 120 minute run-time. The entire duration is also a mechanical collage of one event following the other. The individual scenes too are a collection of random shots cut and pasted together. Had there been even an average amount of flow, maybe the plot and sub-plots thereof would have been coherent enough to touch my belief system. Yeah too many ifs and buts. But it was possible. Because, being a non-superstitious person, I had completely surrendered myself to a movie about black magic. Without such submission there was no hope of enjoying this one. But, that didn't work either. Baby Ahsaas' act though, is really moving. She has very clearly exhausted herself in exhibiting what her character went through, and done really well too. My heart went out as much to her character as to the child artiste herself. On humanitarian grounds, is it really fair to have a 10-11 year old child go through the enactment of such torture? It's the same question I had when I saw The Sixth Sense. It's truly not the question of whether or not one believes in the premise of black magic. It's how believably it's put forth. Such an issue should have ideally made me think of how I'd react if something like this happened in my family. But, as audience I'm kept at such a distance from the procedures that it's almost as if the makers don't want to get me involved. Employing the standard techniques used for the horror genre neither terrified me nor made me think about the topic at hand. * * *Ps. Yay! I actually managed this one without mentioning Aag. Damn it! No...failed yet again...]"
870,"[Wherever in the world I've lived in the last 12 or so years, I have proudly called myself a Bombayite/Mumbaikar at heart. The city has an indescribable energy that sweeps me with it whenever I'm there. Mumbai Meri Jaan, however, is about various characters who don't necessarily have such a romanticized view of Mumbai. Each of them goes through a phase of cynicism and ultimately accepts their situation as is and joins the ""spirit"" of the city. It's a study of characters. Each character is interesting, even if not completely convincing. The combination of characters chosen is fascinating. The resistance to have extreme characters is obvious. Instead, a shade of gray is picked for each one and the variation in the grays, once in a while, defies believability. Yeah, it is also one possible interpretation of what might have been the state of mind of the citizens after the bomb blasts on July 11th, 2006. But, that seems secondary. The bomb blasts could very well have been replaced by any other traumatic event that Mumbai has gone through in the past few years. The focus is more on the social commentary on the economic disparity that the city suffers from, the corporatization of private lives by the media, the two sides of the youth wanting to migrate abroad, and so on.Like the city, Mumbai Meri Jaan is more about the people that make it what it is. Even the bit roles give you a glimpse into yet another character you might find in a city - spoilt rich brats, a sermonizing father, housewives for whom the bomb blasts must have just meant another event, and many more. The main characters, of course, have been dealt with in much more details.Nikhil, an idealist who pays his taxes, refuses to drain the country of it's brain, considers changing his whole life around to deal with the trauma that the blasts bring about. R. Madhavan's demure yet sure personality smoothly transforms into the troubled, paranoid Mumbaikar.  Rupali, the most regular brand of TV reporter, refuses to believe that she's not exclusive. You see Soha Ali Khan turn into a zombie from the confident, aspirational lady she starts out as.  Thomas is a good-hearted slum-dweller whose favorite pass-time is to silently observe the rich and their ways. Irrfan Khan with minimal dialogue manages to convince us of his need to avenge the rich and the self-imposed redemption thereafter. Suresh, a racist, makes everything he sees fit into his conspiracy theory. What more can such a person need to substantiate his argument than an act of terrorism? Suresh's transformation seems the laziest cop-out but Kay Kay Menon, like always, gives the character the body language and attitude that it demands. Tukaram Patil, at the end of his working life as a police officer, symbolizes the impotency of the police department. This cliched character is one of the weakest ones. Paresh Rawal brings his amazing timing to the mostly well-crafted dialogues. His performance can certainly not be blamed for the character's transition from a ""go with the flow"" attitude to giving ""have better aims, do better with your life"" sermons to his juniors. Any which way, one of the main purposes of the character seemed to be to thread the other characters together. The final speech that he gives seemed rather contrived, especially because the connection was not really necessary. Otherwise, the dialogues for all characters are charming because of their ruggedness.You know what all this character development means, right? More run-time. And that is Mumbai Meri Jaan's biggest drawback, even to a patient viewer like me. The climax is one of the most subtle, yet strongest ones I've seen in Hindi cinema in recent times. Only the story tellers have taken 20-25 minutes too many to get there. I wonder how much more compelling the climax would've been if it had come earlier, before the audience had time to get bored.Albeit tongue-in-cheek and supremely clever, there's an undercurrent of sarcasm running through the movie. This sarcasm points a big fat finger at the indifference of people towards others' trauma. Now, taking a cue from the title, these people are from Mumbai. Sure, the climax serves as consolation for all the digs taken on Bombayites and ultimately it balances the tables. But, the effort to make it as unbiased as possible is unmistakable. And for that, despite being in love with Mumbai, I respect the story's comment on its residents.]"
871,"[I just witnessed Kay Kay Menon and Rahul Bose do an Om Puri. As if it wasn't trauma enough to see Om Puri perform like a monkey in movies like Buddha Mar Gaya and Mere Baap Pehle Aap now we have to suffer the heart-break of Kay Kay Menon and Rahul Bose being loud and over-the-top, and shamelessly so. How much more torture is this industry capable of?The thing is that they were not bad performances considering the wisdom that slapsticky performances are supposed to be this way. But, I really wish we were not exposed to this versatility that they are capable of. True, Rahul Bose isn't the greatest performer around, but Kay Kay....Just because I had great regard for the script choices that these two make, I was giving the many Mallika Sherawat sleazy dance numbers and scenes a benefit of doubt. Thinking, maybe the script really demands it. Till, I was proved wrong by Mallika trying to seduce the audience with a straight look in the camera rather than sharing chemistry with her co-stars.Under the pretext of being a satirical comment on the prevalence of slapstick in Hindi cinema, Maan Gaye Mughal-E-Azam ends up adding one more to the ""crappy movies"" list. It starts out trying to be sarcastic about the dismal political and administrative condition of this country. But satisfies itself with just scratching the surface. There is no intention of delving any deeper or ruffling any feathers.And what was all the mockery of Urdu, Mughal-e-azam, Jaane bhi do yaaro for? As far as I know, mockery is done by someone who thinks they are superior to the things they are ridiculing. Now really? Can anyone have such an inflated opinion of themselves? Especially when they are involved with a product like this?While I go balm my hurt, cinema-crazy soul, and in general, get over what I just went through, I seriously hope you were saved from having to bear this.]"
872,"[It's youthful yet elegant. It's contemporary yet identifiable with, by anyone who's had a tiff with a close one. Yes, the layers of love for rock music and issues related to urban life need to be peeled off. But at the core it's a very simple story told with compassion and sophistication.That doesn't mean all your questions are answered. The details of the main conflict are left to your imagination. But, the manner in which you are drawn into the story shows that smart people have been involved in its making. So, I submitted myself, albeit grudgingly, to the fact that their heart was in bringing us the resolution and not the clash. I'd suggest you do the same.Whenever I complain about a cliche or predictability in movies/stories, I question myself, is it such a bad thing? How could they have avoided it in this situation? But, I end up with just one answer - it depends on how it is done. Is it natural, does it flow? Is the nature and flow convincing? The obvious call of events in Rock on!! worked for me because I found myself getting attached to the characters and their relatively ordinary lives. (Even though the characters were being followed by spotlights on half their faces!)Each character in the foursome is representative of the kind of people any group of friends has. The idealist whose self-respect does not resign to compromise (Arjun Rampal), the slightly self-centered one who can't see when he falters (Farhan Akhtar), the easy-go-lucky-cum-jackass who doesn't let anything bother him too much (Purab Kohli) and the one who's more emotionally attached to the 'group' sentiment than the rest (Luke Kenny).The slight shiver in Farhan's hands when confronted by his past, made me gape in awe of not just the actor but also the director, Abhishek Kapoor. Unbelievable that the man's last effort was the appalling Aryan. Same goes for Arjun who looked like he was holding back the dialogues to keep his moustache from falling. Even so, I found myself cheering for him when he came to take his final bow. Purab and Luke too didn't necessarily have the greatest body language yet, you felt bad for how things were shaping up for them when the going was tough.With male-bonding as the central theme, it's refreshing to see women with well thought out characters who influence the direction of the story. Prachi Desai is the strong yet vulnerable Sakshi. You feel like shaking her man to consciousness when he's ignoring her despite the anxiety her eyes convey. You sympathize with Debbie's frustration which Shahana Goswami so strongly brings across. We see ourselves getting pulled into the narrative because the writer, Abhishek Kapoor, has given each of these characters detailed attention. Together, they mature smoothly from adolescent ""we can conquer the world"" enthusiasm to learning to live life the hard way. And yet, even the two less important roles (Purab and Luke) have defining qualities and are not restricted to being the protagonists' ""inner voice"". Moreover, this is all done in good humor.Writer, Abhishek has also shown some imaginative strokes. The onscreen performances of the actors mirror the status of their characters in the band throughout the movie. Almost as if the rock band's chemistry is shared by the four actors. Also, despite parallel narration of two time-spans, very rarely does any event seem out of place.A plausible complaint could be made against the run-time and pace of the movie. I would argue that any tampering with that would take away from the poise and charm of the experience.  * Note on music: My exposure to rock music is negligible. I was recently educated by a rock-enthusiast that lyrics are very plain and factual in rock music. The focus is on the music. This conversation obviously came about when I was complaining about the lyrics of Rock On!! while appreciating how different the music was.I'm still not convinced the lyrics should be highlighted by loud and clear pronunciation, if they are not the focus, especially when they are more or less lame.""aasmaan kyon neela, paani kyon geela geela""  would sound great in a kids' song like ""bum bum bhole"",  but didn't work for me here. (Why's the sky blue, and water all wet? It'd have been alright if the lines at the very least sounded poetic like ""Why's the sky blue, and the water full of dew?"") Songs from ""Zindaggi Rocks"" had awesome lyrics; does that not qualify as rock, then? Anyway, I'm going to buy the CD for the music to grow on me. Oh yeah, do stick around till the last title card shows up.]"
873,"[I take great pains to avoid the family sagas on TV and so am offended when all of it is thrust down my throat by Ekta Kapoor herself. Even if it is taking non-stop digs at her own production house along with a few at realty shows. This is Ekta taking undue advantage of being the producer of this film. Was she by any chance trying to justify the bad quality of her story lines?On the other hand, they've made quite a few others the butt of their imbecile sense of humor - Kaun Banega Crorepati, Karan Johar, Mahesh Bhatt, Akshay Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan's status, Art of living, Jagjit Singh, Nach Baliye, J P Dutta, Doordarshan, and I'm sure many more. Only wish there were a laugh or two tucked in there somewhere.  Well, C Kkompany is not entirely heartless. Post-interval, it does come up with a cute idea to deal with the impotency of the administration to solve the citizens' problems. However, it didn't take it to the next possible step of having the government take up ownership. Instead, soon enough, it gets so shockingly similar to Lage Raho Munnabhai that judging from the tone of the movie it looks more like a dig at it. I'd have been convinced that that's what it is, but for some decent performances by the lead trio.  Not that they make you laugh or smile even, just that they sort-of convince you that they care and are good people. Also, these three had actual differentiating personalities which is missing in most movies of this genre.Seeing Raima Sen in a meaningless role such as this, especially after Manorama - Six Feet Under, made me wonder whether the times are really so bad for good talent. How much life could her eyes and expressions induce in the lousy lines she's given. On the other hand though, despite the derogatory status women are accorded, I liked the fact how regular, ""not hot"", women were cast to play housewives. Songs are to this movie as commercial breaks are to TV programs. Which means its time to go fetch your popcorn, take a short walk to stretch your legs, or whatever it is you need to take a break for.  So, yet again, a concept with potential to entertain dies at the hands of slapstick. Oh well...]"
874,"[A city under seize. 5 bombs threatening to go off. The administration, in turn, turning all its resources up-side-down. We've seen this and a lot more in Hollywood. But, when you take this basic plot, add some very basic action to it, cast the most wonderful cast you could have, you have me arrested - not wanting to blink once.I like to observe how the titles of a movie are done, because in a way, it's a measure of how much respect the decision makers have for their crew. Many a time there's so much noise and glitter during the titles that you are forced to not read the opening credits. So, when half of A Wednesday's titles are plain white text on black background with zero sound, I am hooked. There's one scene where the person threatening to set-off bombs is very close to being caught. At that point, I was wondering how cool it'd be if he's actually caught at this point, wonder how the story will move on. And at the very same time, I was sincerely hoping that he escapes. Just in case, his capture would mean that the movie is close to its end. I hadn't even realized that it's not even interval yet, that's how much I was enjoying the thrill and the build-up.While introducing its characters to us, A Wednesday also takes digs at the influence of ""stars"" in our film industry, gender bias in our society, ""creation"" of news by our media, and the general attitude of our law and order officials. Along the way, it comments on the impotency of our law enforcement department (though, it was refreshing to see a room full of committed police officers). And as a final bang, very smartly, the plot uses the same impotency to make right right. Just less than 24 hours ago, I was applauding a director's effort to give Anupam Kher a non-loud, meaningful role. And here we have a movie which has him as the protagonist. Sure, it doesn't require him to go through the whole range of expressions an actor - particularly this one - is capable of. But what it gives him back is our - his audience's - respect. What can I say about Naseeruddin Shah - I was just left speechless by his character's confidence and angst, whether ill-placed or not. Even though, thrillers are not necessarily the best genre to display acting prowess. Anupam Kher and Jimmy Shergill are what I call the soft faces in the film fraternity. However, stern their characters, you expect them to soften up sooner or later. But they have such strong attitudes here, that when you see Anupam Kher and even Jimmy beat someone up, you don't question it. Both the writing and the performances complement each other. The smaller side characters also have their charm. Like, the young self-made hacker was cute. Yep! I actually found a geek adorable. Speaking of which, except for the amusing graphics on the screen, the other technical talk didn't sound like mumbo-jumbo.The melodramatic background score used to create suspense and the overdramatic slo-mo stylization of Naseeruddin Shah's character are about the only things that irritated me. From the tone of the movie otherwise, especially the muted titles, I got the feel that this excessive drama was not based on creative decisions from the heart but the director resorted to them because he was supposed to. Surprisingly though, the speech in the climax didn't get tiringly preachy. That's mostly because the motivations sounded novel yet believable.Anupam Kher and Naseerudin Shah - truly a pleasure to see you on the screen together, sirs! That too in a thriller...]"
875,"[Had it been one of the first few thrillers ever, Hijack would've been exciting. But, with all the logistical gaps and happy coincidences, it is far, far away from making your nerves jitter.Not that characterizations are first on priority in most action thrillers, but all the characters including the main ones in this one are mere outlines. Let alone having shades to add depth, only one color is chosen for each of them. Especially annoying was Priya (Capt. Vikram's daughter) who is so cheerful despite the most trying circumstances. So strong is this 8-10 year old that she is all smiling on her way to the hostel for the first time even though her father can't control a tear from rolling down his eye. In a movie where almost everything is below mediocre, you don't really expect the best lines for the characters. But, airport ground staff spewing philosophy at a passenger while checking him in is a bit too much. Considering the one-line character sketches and the lame lines, most actors seem to have done a decent job of smiling and being scared. The logic and logistics of the writing too were haphazard. A terrorist gang is so meticulous about planning, that a gun is planted into a chips packet to enter the airport and it reaches fine. But, they take a flight to Amritsar, when they want to go to Dubai without thinking about fuel replenishment! Not all is completely bad. There are a couple of subtle scenes which add flavor to the particular sequence. Like the little boy fetching a phone for a senior terrorist at a rugged training center implying that children were being trained there too. This scene replaces the kids-crawling-under-barbed-wire drill which is customary in showcasing such camps.I really wonder what purpose is served by generic lyrics set to regular music, picturized with aerobic-style choreography? The story certainly doesn't need them. If the producer needs them for commercial success, I certainly hope the audience is not fooled by a supposed-Brazalian miming Hindi. Hijack is the 'leave your brains behind' kind of an action-thriller, Just like slapstick is a kind of comedy. Slapsticks don't make you laugh, Hijack has neither creative action nor manages to thrill.]"
876,"[I'm sure at most times, our mind works in moments, switching threads with or without connection, fluttering around various compartments of our lives. The Last Lear appears to be a peek into the writer's thoughts. We get glimpses playing out one after the other. Only, these glimpses are enacted by the most talented set of performers we have. What is it about? Broken trust? Guilt? An inside look at the passion a man feels for his art? Manipulation another equally passionate artist is capable of? The lives of three women and how one incident has marked their lives? A comment on how working women are treated by their men irrespective of the economic strata they come from? To bring about the difference between plays and cinema? A little bit of each, a whole lot of ultimately nothing. Now, whether this aimlessness is a result of Utpal Dutt's writing or because of the way it is adapted for screen by Rituparno Ghosh and Co. - I don't know. What I do know is it comes across as meandering all over the place. And the only undertones I can interpret are way too contrived to even mention here.The word 'realisitic cinema' is mentioned in the movie. True the characters and their situaions seem real. But there's one thing I don't understand about so-called 'realistic cinema'. Granted, they save us from the bright, eye-torturing color saturation. But does painting it all jaundiced yellow make it any more real? The nicotine tinge wouldn't have bothered me that much if any of the relationships were given apt attention. Also most of the Shakespeare verses sounded more mysterious than meaningful. And since I couldn't decipher the mystery, I sure hope that they were used in context with what was going on in the story at that point.Maybe the parallel narration could be blamed for adding to the patch-work feel. But, I liked how we know Harish Mishra (Amitabh Bachchan) bit-by-bit, sewn together by memories of various people who knew him and the warmth each one feels for him. But that's the narrative style; the character itself is more-or-less one-dimensional. Similarly we know very superficially, what the other characters are going through on that particular day. Shabnam (Priety Zinta) is confident yet vulnerable. Vandana (Shefaly Shah) masks her tender devotion with an arrogant poise. Just because Ivy (Divya Dutta) doesn't react doesn't mean she's dumb or heartless. Yet, I feel cheated, deprived from knowing them more, knowing them better.Despite this, the actors perform with such passion. And this is not just for Amitabh Bachchan. Priety, Shefali, and Divya are so convincing that for me the movie is more about their characters than Harish's. This is certainly the most I've seen Arjun Rampal's facial muscles move - he can actually do it! What a shame that it has taken so long!?Sir Bachchan - what do I say? That his performance was eloquent, his voice modulation articulate, his body language mesmerizing, his diction immaculate, his talent...? Such shallow words they are. Overacting? Maybe - in an off scene here or there. But, I was in awe, rubbing my arms to get rid of the goose bumps during his audition for the director. This in spite of the so unnecessary and out-of-place melodramatic lighting and camerawork. My favorite moments were those when he switched from Harish to a Shakespearean character and back in what looked like single takes.'Moment' - that's the key word throughout. As Harish mentions, ""you never know when 'the moment' will come"". And you see them trying hard to create that perfect moment. But so engrossed are they in doing that, that the motivations of the characters and the movie remain blurry.]"
877,"[The expectations were high; after all we had arguably two of the greatest actors in the business sharing screen space after more than a decade. (The last time was in Michael Mann's crime thriller Heat)Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are both in their sixties and are legends, immortal beings who have defined the very contours of acting.  They have a substantial body of work to their credit and are to boot superstars.  So one has a right to expect the film to be above average if not good.Unfortunately, the film disappoints on all counts.  The screenplay tries to be far too clever, but has an extremely weak rationale for the conflict or loss of faith which is at the heart of the plot.  The writer throws in a decoy here, a red herring there, all of which are weak, and then tries to make it all jell together in the end.  All the decoys make the plot seemingly far more complicated than it is, and distracts the viewer.  One starts to suspect the main plot point about 20 minutes into the movie.The director then takes this badly written material and goes in for fast editing and hand held close-ups to create an edgy feel to the story and characters.  Things seem to move at a very fast pace; I suspect this was done to avoid the feel of a police procedural thriller.  He also chooses a dark predominantly monochromatic colour palette and throws in some grainy, news video type sequences, all for that gritty feel.He has two great actors to work with, but unfortunately they have no memorable lines, neither do they have any standout scenes.  Both De Niro and Al Pacino are competent; they could have done these parts while taking out their laundry.We have at times De Niro relapsing into his trademark ""braggart"" style of declaiming all and sundry, but for the most part his work is low key.  Pacino does not go into the jumpy, edgy mode and remains low key too.The final denouement is terribly listless and lacks any energy.  De Niro and Pacino go through the routine and the movie ends.  By that time anyways you desperately want it to end.A terrible, terrible disappointment is what the movie is; one really wished that the director and the writer had reviewed their brief before they made this film. Seriously, this one is a terrible waste.]"
878,"[I've grown up fighting my fears by reciting the Hanuman Chalisa. Over time I grew into a person who believes that God doesn't need my praise to take care of me. I believe He exists and that's all I need to know. Yet I respect all who find peace of mind from performing rituals. BUT, when followers of one religion try to even imply that their religion is superior to another, I lose all respect for them. And that's what happened with 1920. I couldn't believe it when one religion succeeds at doing something that the other couldn't!So much so that I feel like taking points away from all the repulsive yet thrill-inducing quivers it successfully got out of me on the way to the climax. The finale though, just completely ruined whatever it was building up towards, by being both lame and offensive. Sure, the movie can be taken as a man's journey of losing and regaining his faith. But at the cost of demeaning someone else's belief - unacceptable!There isn't any special craft involved in the writing of the two distinct stories that make this movie either. Unrequited love and undying love brings havoc and redeems soul respectively. There are a few creative lines strewn around but nothing remarkable about the effort as a whole.Just when the deadpan expressions of both the lead actors, Rajneesh Duggal and Adah Sharma, and the haggard pace were beginning to bring a yawn, the story began inching forward.  And I was in complete awe of the many ways in which Adah's body managed to contort, turn, wiggle, and squirm. Her facial muscle movements, make-up, and the special effects all contributed to both the disgust I felt towards the ghost possessing her and how sorry I felt for her character. Rajneesh's face and eyes on the other hand remained blank. Points for consistency?The only things I knew about the movie beforehand were that it's set almost a century ago, and that it belongs to the horror genre. Horror translates to shrill background music and weird camera work, so I was all prepared for that. But, I was pleasantly surprised. In fact the opening sequence had very little music for accompaniment. An eerie ambience was created, alright.Yet, it didn't escape the standard questions one would have of ever-predictable Hindi horror movies. How come a person who turns out to be dissatisfied enough after death invariably resides in a mansion? What stops this ghost from getting out of the mansion? In this particular case it wasn't as if this ghost was attached to the mansion? I guess, a haunted mansion makes more movie-worthy material than a haunted shanty.But, the main glaring, making me fume question remains - How? How can one make such an insensitive movie about religion when it's being used to commit so many atrocities to serve God-alone-knows-what agenda? Freedom of expression, huh? Irresponsible usage - I say...]"
879,"[Noises in his apartment society made Raj Puri (Sushant Singh) a cranky man. This irritability introduced his wife, Abha (Kartikadevi Rane) to a new facet of his personality. The same crabbiness egged the middle-class secretary of the society, Janardhan (Rajat Kapoor), to take more pride in implementing the safety measures causing the crankiness. Repeat. Repeat. And repeat once more. With each round though, the aggravation increased. A piece of anyone's life - the noises replaced by any other irritant that cause tiffs in apartment complexes. But, the repetition made me too lazy to even yawn. Sure, the simplicity of the plot had a Hrishikesh Mukherjee feel to it, and so does the style of narration. But Hulla misses out big time on keeping me engaged. Though, the underlying commentary on the sham that security systems are was amusing, staying attentive throughout was an effort. And I assume it was intended to be a light smile-your-way-through comedy, but these smiles were only occasional. None of which can be blamed on the lead cast. The noises begin annoying you as a viewer despite Raj's clearly unreasonable demands. Thanks to the pained expression Sushant so consistently carries. It's just fascinating to watch the man behind most of the pain, Rajat Kapoor. Watching him as a struggling businessman from a not-so-affluent background was refreshing and it looked like he was enjoying the difference too. The casting of the two is really creative and has worked, because on paper anyone would have been tempted to swap them. Hail versatility!Kartikadevi absolutely comes across as the combination of girl-next-door cum career-minded woman cum home-maker. And 74-year old Chandrachoor Karnik, as the ever-obedient watchman, reminded me of Shaikh chacha, a watchman in our building, who would always nod his head to all instructions. But, the rest of the cast came across as caricatures. They were sketchy representatives of each 'type' of person any apartment complex would have. The writing here surely looked flimsy compared to the lead cast.It is very obvious that this is a fairly low-budget movie from the relatively low-profile cast and the out-of-focus scenes every once in a while. And yet, something different has been tried. Interestingly, though, another ""housing society + stock exchange"" themed movie has released on the same day! Anyway, there is this urge to tell a simple story well. It might not have succeeded completely this time. Come on, how much of another person's boring problem can I be expected to watch? But I'm sure the movie-makers, especially the writers will learn from their follies and meanwhile members of the audience like yours truly will learn to deal with ennui.]"
880,"[""Flat but OK"".- This is how a TV channel describes the graph of the sensex at one point of time in the movie. ""Flat and not OK"" is what would describe the entire movie at any given point. Saas Bahu aur Sensex is about a few women living together in an apartment complex. In an industry where women are mere props in most movies, it is heartening to see someone take the courage to make a movie about everyday housewives. But, the plot is so lifeless that there is hardly any excitement or motivation to get involved with the characters. No doubt it was refreshing to see Kirron Kher as a non-Punjabi, non-loud personality. Also, Tanushree Dutta and Mausameh made a decent show of their introverted and extroverted characters respectively. I was surprised to know that the lady playing the Punjabi from Delhi was actually Sharon Prabhakar! She looked different and annoyed, as, I guess, the character was meant to do. Farouque Shaikh was adorable in his character blushing and getting frustrated alternately. Ankur Khanna managed to make you care for his character but the writing, especially for the climax of his particular character, was unforgivably lame.So was the climax of the movie. The writing, in general, was just too incoherent to make any sense of the characters' motivations. Or, the motivations are so plain that the person seems unbelievable. A representative of each community/geographical region is picked and laced with stereotypes.  Details have no place whatsoever. Things happen and you are expected to accept. The guy who runs the training for accent neutralization in a call center easily bags jobs for his friends. Passage of time is really difficult to follow too. You feel like events are happening on consecutive days, but that doesn't fit in with the way they are laid out. Nope! It doesn't have a great sense of humor either.It might be about woman power but you are turned off by the flimsy writing itself. Let us just hope that in some way it is a harbinger of good times ahead. The Sensex is shown to touch 30,000. Isn't that the hope we need given its behavior in recent times?]"
881,"[""Knock-knock""""Anyone there?""""You...you the multiplex cine-goer...yeah, yeah you - we've made this for you...a collage of the horrors that the interiors of the country suffers from...""Worry not dearies, we've masked it with a dose of humor to make it palatable.""Yes, Welcome to Sajjanpur is here to educate us of the situation in rural India, with a slightly patronizing tone. And it does a good job of it too. The seriousness is toned down with wit albeit slapsticky at a few places. It tries to sensitize without being overtly sensitive. Which is why villagers might find their issues being trivialized.  Issues that they have to grapple with in on a day-to-day basis. Without any qualms, the movie refuses to offer solutions. ""That's not our job"", it says. We have just taken it upon ourselves to let you know this is what's happening in there. Look here, a mere signature is literacy in the census, animal rights are taking precedence over human livelihood, ""widow remarriage"" is a privilege. Sure, you knew that superstition and blind faith seep through the country's veins, that 'politician' is synonymous with 'goon' and farmers sell organs to keep afloat. But, might as well reinforce their existence. Oh, by the way, while we are at it, let us remind you that there is no need to shake off a eunuch with disgust! You know what, though, all these things don't necessarily have to end badly, there are alternative outcomes.That's a whole lot of ground to cover. Using one or two colorful, relatively well-etched out characters each, Benegal highlights issue after issue to form the montage of a village, Sajjanpur. The narrative tone topped up with a border-line loud Shreyas Talpade started getting to me in the first 10 minutes. And throughout, I was wondering, ""why this tone?"" Why are characters disappearing? My suggestion, don't be fidgety like me, there's a reason for that and you'll know when you need to know. Similarly, the songs add to the unrealistic feel. Besides doing their bit to maintain the light tone of the film, they are the way they are for a reason. I'd just enjoy the rhythm that adds to the mood of the village - this group of people who don't lose their smile despite the trying circumstances.Flipside, of course, is that they add to the length of the movie. And that's one place where Welcome to Sajjanpur misses the mark big time. It needed to be at least 15-20 minutes shorter. And this is despite the climax being rushed up. Maybe they were just trying something different in the narrative style, but it felt like a quick fix.The other thing was the accent. For some reason, it came across as forced. One reason could be that Rajeshwari Sachdev and Amrita Rao have a city-bred image that is difficult to shake off. Add to that the fact that they show up in non-village-like attire every once in a while. While Amrita was charming as the wife pining for her husband to come back to her, Rajeshwari looked really uncomfortable in the whole set-up. Smart-alec with a heart, Mahadev (Shreyas Talpade), keeps you curious throughout. How is he going to put his emotions in the next letter he writes for one of the villagers? You want his dreams to come true, however murky the morals behind them be. Am I the only one who thinks Shreyas does an Amol Palekar every once in a while? Each of the other cast members too adds his/her flavor to the village ambience. But, one who stood out was Ila Arun. I can so imagine her as one of my aunts from my native village. You read the newspaper and go on with your day. You'll, in all probability, watch this movie, maybe applaud the effort, and go on with your life. There will be no long-lasting impact, but maybe, just maybe the stories will stay with you.]"
882,"[First time director Marcel Langenegger gets together two A list actors, Hugh Jack man and Ewan McGregor in a film that aspires to be a Noir thriller.  Visuals of city streets at night, of skyscrapers lit up like Christmas candles, of plush hotel rooms cloaked in anonymous neon, unfortunately a noir film do not make.  What a film like this requires is a clever, well developed script, and believable characters.There are three main characters: the nerdy accountant who leads a life so dull and colorless that watching numbers scroll on his laptop gives him the biggest thrill (there is a horrible line where he says that it is all about order and symmetry, really!). A cool, smooth, assured man of the world oh so fit and physical. And the femme fatale, all golden blond locks, long legs, and pouty mouth.The characters remain superficial; the script does not help us understand their peculiar idiosyncrasies nor their motivations.  They seem to have been specifically brought to life so that a film could be made.  The first part of the film has the accountant and the man of the world coming together, and then a very obvious screenplay twist is made to account for the transformation of the accountant's world.And then it gets worse, every cliche is played out, and the film rambles towards the climax.  Now, here is where the director could have kept it short and taut, the climax that is.  Unfortunately he is undecided whether he should wrap things up neatly; throw in a revenge angle, or have a feel good ending.  He ends up having a little bit of everything, which really spoils it all.  The climax is unconvincing, and feels very stretched.A good noir film works when it transports everyday characters into a world that is not so obvious; a world that lurks just around the next corner in the mean streets of the city.  For that the script has to have a good build up and create characters that we can believe in.  Here what we have is caricatures rather than characters, and that just wrecks the film.Both Jackman and Ewan McGregor seem to have done the film only for the money and nothing else.  The actress playing the femme fatale has nothing to do but look good and alternate between tears and laughter.The only good thing for me was to see the delightful Charlotte Rampling on screen in a brief cameo.  I wonder what she was doing there, though!]"
883,"[Breakfast table conversation this morning -My 6 year old son - ""Dad, mom is going to review Hari Puttar today, right?""His dad - ""yes""Son - ""It is like Home Alone, only.""Me - ""Why do you say so?""Son - ""Because my brain told me when I watched the trailer. See, there's one boy in a big house, he asks koi hai (anyone there?), that means he's alone. And there are 2 chors (thieves)""Me - Hmmm... (thinking about this interview)Son - ""I want to watch it, Home Alone was also good.""Like mother, like son - never loses hope...But to no avail. This one can easily be declared a dud, since the efforts to both change the ambience and to tweak the concept are pretentious. As if they were made to satisfy some copyright law that the makers care about. Seriously, if you are not going to make even half an effort on the details, why bother? Might as well just copy it frame by frame and be done with it. You have no clue how difficult it is to watch this one objectively, without comparison. Let's just say, it's a lousy-lousy copy - when not Home Alone, they take a scene from Kungfu Hustle and I'm sure it has bits of Carry On if one of the directors claims so. Actually, there is a bit of originality and contextual alteration. We have one of the burglars using abusive language appropriately beeped off. Now, why one would do that in a kids' movie is beyond me. To top it off, they have a 10-year old being smothered by a skimpily clad Shamita Shetty and a sundry bunch of women. Hmph...Many a time in remakes, if the story fails, other departments compensate. But here, most performances try to complement the loud character and slapsticky tone. Except Zain and Swini seem enthusiastic and look like they were having fun troubling the adults around. But everything else - the costumes of the two burglars, the sets and locations, the background music - are not appealing at all. If nothing else, just plain and simple continuity to make sense out of the mayhem? Na-ah!I think I'm just going to get the entire Home Alone series on DVD/VCD for the kids. Much rather have them watch those. On the other hand, it will be interesting to see how they react to Hari Puttar and see whether they think one of their favorites have been ruined. It's only 90 minutes after all. Oops! That'd mean I'll have to watch it again. No thanks, I think I'll pass.]"
884,"[There's a blunder in the credits. They forgot a title card -Starring: Blue petal, the digital ancestral spiritandDevdutt, the guiding horseWithout them Drona would lack soul and attitude. Not to mention, our superhero wouldn't have a clue, literally! Sarcasm set aside, I really liked the concept behind debutant blue petal - just the overuse annoyed me. As it is, the movie is flat because of its pace. Without them it'd bend downwards at the corners to form a frown.Which would then resemble the ""I carry the burden of the world"" scowl Jaya Bachchan wears. Perfect casting! Seriously, when did the lady smile last, on or off screen? It hurts when I remember she brought smiles by her mere presence and was my favorite female actor till about 10 years ago. Oh well...Anyway, when you have music and cinematography doing the character development there is only so much the actors can do with the one-line character descriptions. And they do the 'so much'. Priyanka Chopra dazzles in shiny outfits, and oh yeah, fights. Kay Kay Menon actually seems every bit the eccentric villain he's supposed to be. He can boast of having delivered two interesting lines in the movie. Abhishek broods and battles. He delivers the occasional dialogue, one of which was awesome! He actually looks really pitiable when he is going through tough times. But that is over quickly. Soon enough he has the ""What the heck is going on here?"" look which absolutely reflects the audience's sentiments. And this stays. Through the car chases. Through one inane sub-plot after the other, especially in the second half.Actually, I really liked the way it started. It had that nice story-telling tone. Characters seemed to have caricatured personalities for a reason - they were part of a mythological tale. The parable itself seemed to have an interesting base. The villain seemed eerily weird. The editing was slick with imaginative transitions. I was enjoying despite redundant songs and having written off the dialogues very early on. What can you expect when an egoist, full-of-himself villain says Gustakhi maaf (pardon me)?Yes, I had begun wondering if the wait for a good, kids', action, Hindi movie is over. But, gradually by the end of the first hour, my inner voice wanted to reach out to the makers, demanding an interval. Cut now, or you are going to have nothing to say later. They didn't listen.And the second half made the pre-interval phase a blur. You know how 'stars' are introduced in a typical masala Hindi movie? - Slow motion, inexplicable melodrama, enhanced with jarring music in background, cameras making movements to make the tall actor looking even more larger-than-life. The entire second half seems like it is introducing one actor or the other! There's a bit of that in the first half but it seems so negligible by the end. The emotional drama takes forever to unfold - Drona and mama, Drona and Sonia, Drona and his father, Drona and his ancestors, Drona and his horse, Drona and his enemy. And get this Drona is not the supercool hero who can taken on the world himself, he needs them at every move. However, he somehow knows how to combat and his heroic skills suddenly peak every time he needs to save his bodyguard (Priyanka Chopra). And this ain't any regular protector, she's the 'royal' bodyguard who needs to be majestically rescued every 10th minute! And at the end of it? There is no satisfactory achievement, just some more mumbo-jumbo about having saved the world.True, there have been quite a few lame superheroes. He gets to be special because well, he's the 'chosen one'. Usually the sidekicks are a set of strong personalities with their interesting idiosyncrasies. But here, who has the time for such stuff when you are location hunting all over the globe and know you are going to spend a lot of time in post production with the digital intermediate guys. Our man just needs to be at the right place, at the right time, with the right amount of background music and camera movements for over a couple of hours.So, are the special effects and action sequences worth a trip to the theater? Well, I'd think not. If you like movies just for those things, you must certainly have seen it all already - if not in a Hindi movie elsewhere. You can think of Drona as the coming of age of a 'special' boy. He supposedly finds love, loses it - twice, finds it again, overcomes his fears, and discovers his 'inner strength'.  He achieves all of this, at most times by just walking a few steps and the rest is taken care of by the graphics department. The struggle 'external' or 'internal' doesn't quite reach a high note. And that doesn't quite work.]"
885,"[Kidnap does raise interesting questions. What is a small or a big unintentional mistake? Who decides the proportionate punishment? What if the punishment is disproportionate? To what extent should the injustice be set right? What can set it right? Maybe there are straight answers theoretically. Now what if you are the wronged person? What if the stakes are made higher with your child/ person closest to your heart is involved? But, in the tug-of-war between asking these questions and adding commercial masala, the latter pulled harder. And we have a decent story with not-so-decent execution. Despite the superficial presentation, it's very intriguing to see the movie balancing in the gray zone. There's no hero and no villain. At the most there are two anti-heroes. You can't hate or love either of them, but somehow you aren't indifferent either. You want to know what they've learnt, and how they've changed at the end of the events. Sanjay Dutt perfectly balances between the street-smart, conniving businessman, Vikrant Raina and the vulnerable father. True Kabir (Imran Khan) is written in good detail, he is supposed to be cynical and all. But in the eagerness to stylize the character Imran Khan's dialogue delivery comes across as very forced. The mid-sentence pauses meant to add attitude, manage to add to the unnaturalness. The narrative, and not Imran's performance, show how a wrong or harsh decision by one person can affect another person's life. So much so that the latter is obsessed with completely bringing down the other person emotionally. Unfortunately though, other parts of the writing department leave gaps in the narrative. There are a few courtesy smart lines thrown in with a full dose of inanities. What was the point of the clues? It wasn't as if one was leading to another. How the clues are solved is not clarified. And later there are clues that are not even cryptic - they are direct messages. Then why even call it a clue?Also, there are women in the ring too, and they have reasonable-sized screen presence; but their characters aren't really serving any deeper purpose. Minissha Lamba absolutely behaves like a 18 year old spoilt brat, but she certainly doesn't look like one. How many ever wet-scenes-in-white she has or however unclad she is, she doesn't ooze oomph. Skin show is very in-the-face generally but there is something very ungraceful about it here. Her inelegant dance moves don't help either. And she certainly cannot take on Kareena Kapoor, Amisha Patel or even Aishwarya Rai in this department.I'm still in shock after seeing Vidya Malavade play Minissha's mom! Though it's a very courageous move, again the deep-necked business suits have been capitalized rather than her acting skills. So, the sum total of cleavage is tasteless and rather functional. The movie doesn't carry the rugged look that the promos have. It has a very color-saturated feel. That the kidnapped has a full wardrobe - matching shoes included - to her disposal adds to that feel. Did the kidnapper go shopping for her? Or did he take a pit-stop at her home on his way to where he was going to hide her? And who changed her clothes the first time? These things wouldn't usually make it into a review, but they are so blatant that they add significantly to the already unrealistic feel. Oh yeah, there are enough engagements and wedding anniversaries thrown in to have songs with lousy music. Unrealistic has its advantages though. A couple of actions scenes are really well choreographed and thought out. Bikes and cars are made to do a few imaginative stunts. And human beings aren't left out. The chase scene set in an under-construction building actually has Imran doing Spiderman moves.If only, they could have resisted over-stylizing it. Or maybe this is just a hangover from the director's last endeavor Dhoom 2 and this is a first step towards having an actual story in an action-thriller.]"
886,"[You can look at it as yet another heartbreaking story about several nameless prisoners on each side of the Indo-Pak border. Or you can look at it as a moving story of one family affected by the injustice embedded in the situation. Either way its a movie that touches you.A few years of Ramchand Pakistani's life is so sensitively narrated that it manages to completely absorb you for those 100-odd minutes. His journey starts with him as any other 8-year old, immature child who vies for his mom's attention and considers his dad as competition. But the situation he lands himself in leaves him no option but to connect with his father. That marks a start to their bitter-sweet relationship. From a scared, anxious little boy Ramchand grows into a hardened, defiant young man who just moves on with life as it comes. The move is as much about the situation as it is about the bonds Ramchand forms - with his mother, father, the police officer, and other prison inmates. None of this would have come through without one wonderful performance after another. Especially, Nandita, whose pride in her honour will not let anyone pity her despite her dire situation. Without a single word her anguish, her confusion at why she's been dealt such a lousy hand, and her willingness to move on with life, reach us.Like the flute playing in the background, other subtle things keep the story balanced. The story is about a Hindu family living in Pakistan and a couple of them end up in an Indian jail with a kind Muslim jailer. The treatment towards the untouchables, the torture in prisons, child abuse by jail inmates, extortion of money-lenders - all are depicted without hitting hard. The aim is clearly to talk of a situation without pointing fingers and not to sensationalize. Just because people get used to whatever crap life offers them, does it mean we should let them happen? - It asks ever so quietly without letting gloom overwhelm you.]"
887,"[I recently visited Sikkim, the tiny, north-eastern state of India that borders three countries. Needless to say we encountered a lot of military camps, one such at 17100 feet above sea level. One question always haunts me - what makes a person decide he wants to stay away from his family, face death every day? What kind of passion drives him? Heroes makes an attempt to answer this question. Unfortunately, what started off very interestingly as a debate is only a camouflage leading us to a pre-determined conclusion.The stories of the three soldiers encompass all intimate relationships - spouse, siblings, and parents. And it does so well, by clearly defining each prominent member of the family. But, that can't be said about the two bikers who set out to meet these families, Sammy and Ali. There are very slight differences and the things that move or trigger their behavior are fuzzy.Anyway, the story is not as much about them as it is about what we can draw from the three families. Alas, only one story manages to touch you. The others are crippled by over-dramatization and predictability. The elegance beautifully seeping into interiors of Punjab is a real treat - especially since it's in such contrast with how loud Punjabis are usually depicted as in Hindi movies. Certainly, Preity Zinta's composed performance had a lot to do with how her story moves you.Soon enough, Sunny Deol takes over all the loudness that we were apparently missing. And from then on the narrative is downhill. Sunny Deol comes across as eccentric, but then again, his character was supposed to be eccentric. Having given that benefit of doubt too, it was a bit much to handle. This is followed by Mithun Chakraorty's story which had a lot of potential since he was the only affected character debating against people joining the army. But, it just didn't have the required vigor and enthusiasm to take the movie through to touchdown. The other culprit is the length of the movie. The forever, dragged on hugs just don't have a place in a movie like this. And it does become a bore when the subtlety gives way to long-winded spiels that shove patriotism down our throat. The slapsticky introduction of the bikers too, was absolutely out of tune with the rest of the movie. Not to mention the songs. Do we really have to see one Deol brother teach the other how to dance?! It requires courage to avoid the sleaze and the so-called glamour. Yet, Heroes does manage to raise a question and answers it, even if not convincingly. It gives us an opportunity to salute.Salutes to the heroes who lay down their lives for us. Salutes to their families who make sacrifices like it were their duty. Salutes to the bravery and to the pride.]"
888,"[Unfortunately, that also means its not all good either. Anyways, compliments first for making some brave scripting decisions, which is important for a power-of-politics based movie. Though it is common sense that the story should be the focal point of the movie, yet such movies are few and far between. So, they need to be applauded when they come along. But, alas this one too ultimately fails in taking the audience into the thick of the action. Various tactical twists in the story, especially towards the climax are just to be accepted because ""Sarkar"" says so. A riveted Amitabh Bachchan fan might not even mind doing so, especially because the fan is presented with such an intense performance in the long monologues. There's nothing specifically wrong with the lines, they are crisp, and are occasionally garnished with a tangy sense of humor. But, is it fair to make the movie about one actor when the jockeying for power by various characters is so interesting? Without taking away anything from the legendary actor's entire range of expressions, I really would have liked to see the other characters' motivations instead of just a verdict passed by the central character.Also, this central character is not really consistent. His motivations and the way he gets influenced/convinced by his dominant son are rather unconvincing. And if you look at Sarkar's character change over the two movies it is really unbelievable. A man who was so sensitive to a stranger's daughter's rape a movie ago is so practical about death and betrayal. He suffers physical trauma but is willing to treat the death as collateral damage?!Likewise, Shankar, Sarkar's arrogant, disrespectful son (Abhishek Bachchan), doesn't feel fully developed. His quiet demeanor goes with the sudden bursts of anger. But, somehow the father-son relationship seems very forced and contrived. The emotional bond is fuzzy and hence has to be taken only on face value. Due to this one-dimensional portrayal Abhishek is required to hold just this one expression on his face throughout, with minimal variation.Anita (Aishwarya Rai) too has a very skimpily etched out character. Her interactions with Shankar seem extremely superfluous. I think both Aishwarya and the way her part is written are to blame for it. However, it is amazing how deglamorized she looks. And I am not sure where the thin line between identifying characteristics of side characters and making them look like caricatures dissolves. The supporting cast doesn't do much in terms of evoking fear or hatred. So, my resolution to ignore or rather to make peace with the expected, overactive camerawork and ear-splitting, background score worked. Once I decided not to give these things the satisfaction of a reaction, the going got a little easier on the delicate grayness in the head. An occasional cringe was unavoidable. I'm human after all. The thing is, the director is in love with the music and camera decisions and is in fact very proud of them. Now, once you know that, the only thing you can do is register your protest - ""me no likes this deafening-is-such-a-mild-word music and sway-here-there-and-everywhere camera movements."" I must admit, though, that I didn't mind the relatively limited use of close-ups too much this time around. Part of the credit would go to the performances and a lot of it to the way the faces were lit. The natural source of light is consistently kept in mind and I loved the fact that the colors used were in tune with the general serious and intense tone of the movie.So, very low expectations set by previous experiences might have contributed towards me liking this one. But, yet there are huge chunks of the movie, especially towards the end, where I would have liked more people acting out the story instead of just one person sitting me down and reading it to me. Oh well, worse have been made and yet it's not an entirely dissatisfying experience.]"
889,"[So many movies based on religious fundamentalism have come and gone, that you wonder if any stone is left unturned in this territory. And then comes along a movie like Aamir that not only defies all standards of film-making in Hindi cinema, but also breaks barriers of approaching the subject. Be warned though, that you are in for a very slow paced, extremely serious cinema.Movies of this genre are made to inspire the audience. And usually they end up inspiring by a long, unwieldy sermon in the climax. But here, since you are so in tune with what the character is going through just by seeing him, you start thinking how you would react in that situation. And ultimately, you realize its all building towards inspiring you by action and not just by words. Every time I watch a Hindi movie in which I feel what the protagonist is going through without anyone telling me, but just by observation, it scores with me. Such is the brilliance of the performance by Rajeev Khandelwal who plays Aamir Ali. Despite knowing very little about the kind of person Aamir is, we feel what he is going through on that particular day of his life.His performance is adequately supported by regular day-to-day dialogues. Also, since the dialogues are minimal, the plain lines don't get boring. The dialogues given to the villain though are repetitive and thus mundane. Also, the ""villainish"" things he is made to do on his chair in a dimly-lit room are too in-the-face and unimaginative compared to the tone of the rest of the movie. Because they come across as typical, you are reminded that you are actually watching a movie. And thus he hardly strikes terror in the minds of the audience. What is terrorizing though, is the ambience created by the sets/locations. Be it a stench-filled place, or a claustrophobic hotel room that Aamir is confined in, or the crowded roads where he feels everyone is watching him - all make you feel like getting Aamir out of there as soon as possible. The lighting keeps in mind the source of natural light in each scene and adds towards the ""natural"" feel of the movie. Similarly, the camerawork - especially the close-ups and handheld camera movements get you deeper into Aamir's state of mind. Even the combination of slow pace and short run-time works towards achieving the required impact. There is a bit when 3 minutes into the story, time is actually elongated to maybe almost double its length. But since the movie itself is barely over 90 minutes, and you are so engrossed, the slow motion doesn't get annoying.The songs complemented this style of narration too. Especially ""ghumiyo"", which in a way was symbolic. The traffic jam Aamir is trying to resolve seems so much like the confusion in his life that he is trying to sort out. The background score is the only thing that seemed abrupt to me. As in the music itself was very good, but since it didn't flow from one scene to another, it felt jerky. Maybe, just maybe this movie could have dropped one level on the rating scale for a part of the audience because of its pace, but the build-up in the drama can only be sensed in a closed, dark environment. It would be injustice to all the faculties of film-making by watching it at home, with all the distractions and the smaller screen.]"
890,"[Note: The names mentioned in the cast above have given their voices to various characters. Visit the official site for details.Not to be confused with Tamil film Dasavtharam, Dashavtar is a Hindi animated film. It is literally about the 10 avtars of Lord Vishnu according to Hindu mythology. Good if the aim is to educate kids about our mythology without reading books or presenting our own interpretation of the religion to them.This description of God and his greatness is pretty skewed according to me. I'm a Hindu too, but I doubt my God is so ego-centric that he won't grant me my wishes if I don't pray to him. Closing my eyes and regurgitating lines in Sanskrit that I don't understand has never gone down well with me. So, when Ajay and his little sister who are sort-of anchors that link the 10 avatars are told to say a ""mantra"" to get to another place, I cringe. And wonder, do I really want my kids to have faith without understanding?That besides though, if the aim is just to get kids acquainted with the subject, Dashatar might be a good start. Of course, 10 stories are told in about 110 minutes, so expectations of details should be minimal. Especially in the longer tales of Rama and Krishna. However, not everything is accurate from whatever tales I've heard since childhood. Not that I have researched the topic in depth, but I have always seen Ravana with ten heads, never with seven. Also, I always thought Ravana was a competitor for Sita's swayamwar (the practice in which a girl chooses a husband from a list of suitors). Then why is he surprised to see that Sita is actually beautiful. And why was Buddha avatar completely omitted? Blunders for a movie aimed at educating the young, if you ask me.But, then again, they have tried to keep it light by including songs. And don't miss the bollywoodification of the Gods and the demons in the Kurma (Turtle) avatar. It is hilarious! Might even offend some people. There's nothing much I can say about the low budget animation other than the fact that it is obviously low budget. And it is low on creativity too. I don't understand why all, Narada, Vishnu, Brahma look the same. Similarly, Sita and Laxmi look the same too. Yet, you see glimpses of good use of colors in a couple of songs, ""Ram Ram Sri Ram"" and ""Tim tim tim tim tare"". So, I would much rather read a Tinkle on the subject to my kids. But, that would be mainly because of the ideological differences with the way God is portrayed. Otherwise, barring a few glaring flaws pointed like the ones above, this movie might be a good way to introduce mythology to the little ones.]"
891,"[Based loosely on the real-life story of a group of MIT students who ended up taking on Vegas casinos at their own game, 21 offers an entertaining alternative to the usual muliplex fare.Jim Sturgess stars as Ben Campbell, MIT grad student and aspiring Harvard entrant, who finds himself swept up into the secretive MIT Blackjack team. Sturgess puts in a nicely layered performance, appearing equally believable as his character moves between geeky college boy and Vegas high-roller. Kate Boswoth chips in as likeable fellow team member Jill Taylor. Sadly, despite a decent performance, Bosworth finds her character mainly utilized as the love interest rather than as a strong female lead.Aaron Yoo, Liza Lapira and Jacob Pitts (as Choi, Kianna and Fisher respectively) make up the remaining team members, ably led by Kevin Spacey as college professor (and team mastermind) Mickey Rosa.Of course, a nemesis is required, and Laurence Fishburne is well suited to the role of casino security chief Cole Williams. Despite not much material to work with, the ever-reliable Fishburne gets the job done and brings depth to his character.Although inspired by the real-life adventures of the MIT Blackjack team, 21 is still very much a dramatized account. In fact, there has been some controversy surrounding the Hollywoodization of the story; particularly in the ethnic makeup of the cast. In real life, the MIT team members were predominantly of Asian-American descent. But in the movie account, the key players are caucasian.Controversies aside, director Robert Luketic ensures that the story rolls along smoothly and does a skillful job of explaining the statistical principles behind card counting without boring the audience.Of course, whenever card games are depicted in cinema, there's always some explanation required, even for a game as simple as blackjack. In 21, this exposition is less clunky than say, in Casino Royale, but it's still there. Still, in the trade-off between clarity and economy, Luketic makes the right choices.Despite this, several of the scenes rather feel like they were shoehorned in to perk up the drama. I have sympathy for the filmmakers here - how do you sustain audience interest for two hours in a story about college kids playing cards? - but it's not hard to spot the melodramatic scenes injected to add spice to the story.On balance, the movie is well-paced and still keeps a few surprises in store along the way. It also poses a few interesting questions - how does money change us? What really counts as 'winning' or 'losing'?As welcome departure from the usual roster of summer blockbusters, 21 is well worth a watch.]"
892,"[Of course, the theme of friends having fun together is hardly new or ""different"". But if the gags are intentionally funny, fresh or presented with freshness, devoid of toilet humor, and fairly non-adult, I'm in. Doesn't mean that De Taali doesn't have such quips or has a water-tight script. Hardly! Its just that there are ""other"" really funny situations and jokes too. Also, at most times, the humor is situation driven rather than a situation being forced in to accommodate the lines. Another round of applause for the writer because he actually made the girls relevant and funny in the comedy genre. If only they could have sewn it together into a coherent plot. Anyway, the thing about laughing out loud and so hard-n-long that the neighbor gives you a long stare is that you begin to let go your requirements of ""good cinema"". First you suspend your disbelief, then you put your brain to the proverbial rest for a couple of hours, then you give in. Give in to the silliness of it all. Give in to the eccentric side characters and their comic relief sub-plots. It doesn't happen to me too often, but when it does even a couple of those hearty laughs make the movie worth it. However the completely haywire last half hour and the abrupt, casual and ridiculous climax is absolutely unforgivable. Also references to a particular support group are in bad taste and don't go with the otherwise sensitive tone of the movie. Ritesh Deshmukh who plays a-new-plan-a-minute Paresh Gurudev is as good with his comic timing as ever. He actually looks slimmer and sleeker than Ayesha Takia playing the loving, caring Amrita. But being on the ""chubby"" side with almost constantly braided hair makes her character more adorable, more girl-next-door, more ""identifiable with"" type. Its nice to see a female lead not oozing her sexuality on us.Aftab Shivdasani is a pleasant surprise. He is the affluent Abhishek who falls in true love with every other girl he meets. The man actually has the potential to make you smile! In order to bring out contrast between Amrita and Kartika's mysterious character, Rimi Sen is given a tanned, sexy look. She is a revelation too. It is amazing how the women in De Taali show that all they need is a reasonably well written character.I actually liked the fact that we were not entertained to a whole lot of back-story of all the characters. Only that much was revealed about their background as was necessary to move the plot forward. But, this has its own drawbacks. Whenever a particular plot point is disclosed, your mind travels back to when the relevant piece of information was told to you first, and in a way you feel manipulated. I know, it sounds like I'm asking for just the right amount of information that ""I"" want. But doesn't the art lie in making the movie so engaging that these thoughts do not come to my mind while I'm watching it? Overall though, I enjoyed being with the here-and-now of the characters. Especially considering that a possible alternative would be a voiceover reading out each character's resume to acquaint us with them.Yet, I'm sure the movie could've been liked by many more if it had been a good 30 minutes shorter. And though the foot-tapping numbers have decent lyrics and are set to some cool choreography, they are still out of place. Any day, I would prefer fewer songs to a 2 hour+ movie.]"
893,"[Since this is first time I am guest posting out here I feel I probably should mention that I am extremely shallow. You will learn more as you read.Given the current fare running in the movie halls the past few months I was hoping for a release that would have me rolling in the aisles. Get Smart does not disappoint. In fact I think I should go back for a second screening since I don't think I did the movie justice with the amount I laughed the first time. There is only so much you can laugh before your sides start  protesting. The movie stars Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway. Two actors who never particularly interested me when I saw their initial movies. I saw Carell first in Evan Almighty. The only thing lower than my opinion of him was my opinion of that movie.I found Anne Hathaway plain even after the transformation in Princess Diaries because she had weird knees. All dislikes went out of the window with the string of movies that followed showing her in better light (and probably better make up). The loss of puppy fat and her sudden aversion towards clothes probably had a lot to do with my decision as well. The situation in the movie is not original. Carell's character, Max Smart holds a desk job at an Intelligence Agency and aspires to be a field agent. With typical insensitivity the agency keeps him chained to the desk. A security breach that compromises the identities of all their agents finally gives Max the chance he was waiting for. The cinematography is by the book. There are no experimentations or any alternative styles that have been adapted. Editing to the untrained eye is pretty smooth and this movie was never meant to have an arty angle. While transitions are pretty smooth, the action sequences might get a viewer to do double takes. Whether it was to save on costs or time or done with a specific purpose I guess we might never know but the high paced, fast take action sequences have been shot on a digital camera as opposed to a film camera that is utilized in the rest of the film. Or it might be just to mask the fact that neither Anne Hathaway nor Steve Carell have done any high flying action roles prior to this film and lacked the proper knowledge of executing them.What follows, of course, cannot be told without breaching this blog's central theme. Do prepare yourself for outrageous action and stunts. You won't have time to dwell on thinking how unrealistic any of them were since at this point your logic has stopped functioning. That's a good thing. On my hilarity scale it ranks pretty high. Euro Trip, Ice Age 1 &amp; 2; Get Smart definitely follows that list.]"
894,"[thoda pyaar thoda magic is a crash course in moral science for second graders and below. And I'm pretty sure this target audience is going to thoroughly enjoy the lesson because it has song and dance, cartoons and naughtiness. So, parents can sit happy, because kids are taught animal rights, civic sense, love over war, forgiveness, importance of bonding over blood relations, being both a graceful winner and loser, religious tolerance all in a little over two hours. And I'm pretty sure there must be a couple I missed out on.You know what this means for the adults, right? One hell of a sappy movie! Over-idealistic to the hilt, and indigestibly sweet. I doubt even songs with underwater shots of a bikini-clad Ameesha Patel can compensate for that. In fact, that's a very high price to pay for tolerating the shrill character she plays. I know-I know, that's what the character demands, yada, yada. But, it hurts to watch the same excuse being used for Saif Ali Khan. He wears one sullen look throughout the movie despite being capable of very varied range of expressions. True, his character is very somber. But, the man just couldn't cry or make me feel for him in emotional scenes. Of course, blame is equally apportioned between his talent and the way the character develops.  The transformation from aloofness to bonding, from long silences to talking his heart out is a little too quick.Is it just me or does Rani Mukherjee really look and feel almost the same in most of her movies? It's not like she isn't trying out different roles. Yet, somehow today while watching the movie I got this feeling of ""been there, seen that"". Maybe it has something to do with that extra layer of make-up they find necessary to apply to make her look fairer. Anyhow, something was amiss and everyone involved just felt like they were going through the motions.Also, while watching the movie today, I suddenly realized how my kids idolize RV and Shona, the characters Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukherjee play in Ta Ra Rum Pum. I can so visualize them now idolizing Ranbir and Geeta after watching this one. Does that mean when they grow up they are going to say, ""we grew up watching Saif or Rani who were in movies for kids like us"" just like we say today, ""we grew up watching Al Pacino or Amitabh Bachchan who made us wanna be like them.""  Scary, eh? If that's the onus they carry, they have to get better than this, because they are so capable of doing it. I digress. Coming back to the movie at hand, the dialogues and situations are pretty plain given that it's supposed to be about four really naughty kids. And the children enacting these roles are not super-adorable either. In a way it's nice to see regular kids playing regular kids. And it's better to have them do nothing compared to having them do the same old tricks that kids pull to harass adults. But that also means nothing really exciting is happening. Although some of the tributes given to various movies from yesteryears are cute. Also, the usual melodious and lively number from Kunal Kohli movies is missing here. Although I loved the way all of them were visualized. The choreography was bare minimum and the overall effect used was charming. The main problem though is we are in touch with a lot more cinema - Indian and foreign - compared to the generations before us ever were. So, obviously after this kind of exposure, it would be really difficult to spot something 'new' in terms of animation and special effects. The onus then completely lies in creatively utilizing these effects. And that the thoda pyaar thoda magic team manages to put together well. Yeah, things can appear and disappear, and inanimate stuff can dance, but how and when they do it is what counts, and that works pretty well here. The question remains - why don't we have movies that kids and adults can enjoy together?]"
895,"[I couldn't stop laughing for about a minute after the credits started rolling. And had a smile on my face for the next few minutes. Nope! Even the most easily amused can't term this one a comedy. I am just kicked by how the audience is taken for a ride. It's not a super-fun ride because by no means is it a great cinematic experience or an entertainer. It's just a smart concept that didn't manage to keep me hooked. In the interest of sounding a little less abstract and yet be truthful to the theme of this blog, I'm going to use an analogy. Say, you are a teacher who's going to introduce a new topic to the class today. To make the lesson more interesting you choose to play a game. Now the idea of playing a game is really neat, but, BUT if you choose a boring game, you have lost your class. Your creativity is admirable, but the class is not engaged. So, the idea of playing a game here is the broad concept of Via Darjeeling and I'm going to call the choice of game, the basic story. The conversation between a bunch of people discussing an event can only be as interesting as the event. As a character points out, this discussion could have been a classic study of human nature. But it's not, because the basic premise is lame. The story is somewhat saved by the ever-reliable Kay Kay Menon. The subtle changes in his character as he moves from one part of the movie to the next, are absolutely attributable to his performance. You can actually see some of it in Parvin Dabas' act too. Sonali Kulkarni's hammed up performance can also be passed off under the guise of her character's eccentricity and ambiguity. But, the entire set-up of friends talking, having fun, quibbling with each other, came off as extremely superficial. If one relationship oozed with extreme familiarity at one point, in the next, the same characters would be saying things to each other that made them seem like strangers. There's only fleeting interplay amongst the characters.So, while the individual characters were detailed, the relationships were very broadly sketched. And we are talking about the likes of Vinay Pathak, Rajat Kapoor, Sandhya Mridul, Prroshant Narayanan here. I have liked their work in one movie or the other, so am not willing to blame them completely for lack of the proverbial chemistry. Compound that with the overall drawling tone of the movie and you can't be blamed for getting a wee bit fidgety. And if that wasn't enough, the songs are absolutely misplaced, and don't go with the ambiance created by the movie. Yet, the director cannot be written off, because he tried. Tried something not ventured into easily by Hindi cinema - a story without a closure. There's after all no conflict that needs resolution. And trying out gets brownie points around here. Along the way, he also commented on the basic nature of humans to indulge themselves in something that doesn't concern them whatsoever. And though it doesn't hook the audience, it surely teases them right through to the end.]"
896,"[It has to be a strong movie to leave an impression even after 21 hours have passed since the movie got over. Even if the strongest urge is to yell at the makers of the movie asking them, ""WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!?"" The love is as drab and unengaging as could be. 2050 looks appealing for about 5 seconds. And what story they were talking about here? I need an explanation. How can a movie set in 2050 have a song every 15 minutes? The phenomenon has reduced in the last few years. Are we going to do a full circle? At least, I hope by then, we'll have an ""ignore"" button lurking around somewhere that can be pressed whenever chords play together in the name of music. At the very least, maybe all songs can be played together during interval. What bliss! In queue for coffee instead of listening to lulling music you would hate to get up from. Anyway, time travel can be made to twist your gray cells in ways unknown to them. But, here they actually manage to make it boring by showing us how 48 years from now, we'd have a hologram irritate us while we are shopping, and how product placements are going to get only worse. I actually had enough time amidst the super-slow proceedings to actually pray that I'd be no more by 2050.To be honest, I hadn't gone in with any major expectations from the story. I was hoping for many firsts as far as technical wizardry in Hindi cinema goes. Zilch. I thought a sci-fi movie would mean mind-boggling action. There was action, but 'mind-numbing' would describe it better. I was intrigued by the decision to open with Dalip Tahil and a random woman playing secretary, both of whom have no relevance to the rest of the story. I was shocked at the pace of the first few minutes in an action movie.I revised my expectations right there. Who said action movies have to move at a fast pace? They are defying the narrative style of the genre, why walk towards slamming the door at them in just 15 minutes. Yet, I couldn't help smirking at the fluttering animated butterfly. The smirk turned to an eye-roll the second time, to a 'no way' the third and an exasperated helplessness overtook after that. When the script is so loose...did I just call something non-existent 'loose'?...anyway, when the script is such, I think it is unfair to judge the performances. Lousy lines cannot make even the best of actors woo their audience. Yet, Priyanka Chopra did a relatively decent job of portraying the duality in her two characters. I seriously don't want to make a call on Harman Baweja just yet. The Baweja family must have poured their heart into this one, but I can see only brickbats coming their way. For a story that, according to director's note at the official site, was conceived 9 years ago, the way the movie was shot felt very superficial. Throughout I got the feel that a location or stunt was chosen and the story was more or less woven around that. Also, I think it is the disproportionate amount spent on marketing to be blamed. Had they not created such hype, the shock of watching a bad movie might have softened. On the other hand, had they not created a movie with such random logic, goofed-up concept, fake romance, token villain (geez) and....aah too late for such wishful thoughts!You know what the silver lining is though? Poverty will be eradicated 42 years from now - I couldn't spot Dharavi in Mumbai (the largest slum in the city). Three cheers to that one!]"
897,"[Jaane tu is sweet, but not saccharine sweet. It's more the fun, peppy sweet. Yet it does not reach the heights of a lasting entertainer, mainly because of the sudden limp in the story 3/4ths way down the line. It just came across as aimless and rather random after that.However, the spoof-ish undercurrent running through the movie is completely adorable. The digs on all things ""Hindi cinema"" are thoroughly enjoyable. And I could almost sense how the writer is having a hearty laugh by having the audience lap up, the mother of all cliched climaxes, without complaining. The college campus feel of the movie is going to make the young identify with the characters and their situations. And the slightly less young will enjoy the nostalgia. I liked the way various relationships were built. Be it the mother-son, the father from the portrait-son, the brother-sister, and of course friends and lovers - all these equations came across well but yet had an anti-climatic feel about it. Genelia and Imran Khan both bring a breath of freshness on the screen. It's as much their timing as it's the natural, much needed casualness they afford their characters that make them dear to the audience. I especially liked the insecure, confused, disappointed body language that Genelia presented in the second half. We know for sure that they are here for the long haul, at least for the chirpy, less serious kind of roles.Anything ""Aamir Khan"" has to have music that adds to the ambience of the movie and its true with this one too. So, even with a forced in number like ""pappu can't dance"" you find yourself swaying to the music. While there isn't a shred of doubt that ""kabhi kabhi aditi"" is one of the most romantic numbers to have come out in recent times, ""pappu can't dance"" and ""nazre milana"" have also grown on me with repeated hearings. To be honest, I just don't feel right judging a movie while sitting in the corner seat of the third row (from the screen). The camera angles, the colors, the sound - all seem off to me. So, I think it'd be unfair to make any comment on any of these aspects. So, yeah, I had a smile on throughout the movie but the base story is a little disappointing in terms of originality. I felt a little cheated by the ultimate turn of events somehow didn't go with the tone of the movie and thus made it land in the ""much ado about nothing"" category.]"
898,"[And just in case you are wondering, I am no big fan of what our film industry churned out during that period. Of course, it's over-generalization, but I'm talking of those specific movies with very loose characterizations and even looser transformation of these characters. The kind where the makers thought they are being blasphemous if they didn't present us with a badly choreographed song, with worse writing and cookie-cutter music every 10 minutes. Very rarely do I allow myself to judge a movie in the first few frames. But sappy, long, unwieldy words of gratitude from the director to everyone he felt thankful to, one after the other, did it for me. Now, the actual first few frames of the movie reaffirmed the cyncism. Aerial shots of a four-horse chariot running wild on brown pasture lands. This could look beautiful, but here it just doesn't. Bouts of directorial creativity surface every once in a while, only for you to wish they didn't. Because they are in the form of a two lips touching awkwardly (not kissing!) under a...table fountain!! Or picture this - yetannuder romantic number playing. Manisha Koirala is upto some random dance, suddenly one of her palms faces camera with her lover's name written on it and a red mark on the little-finger edge of the palm. Next, the other similarly red-marked palm, with her name on it this time, joins the first palm at the red spots to form a heart!!!!! Sheeesh...film-makers, the audience has grown up...when will you?]"
899,"[Staring at the computer. Checking the thesaurus. Wrecking my brain. Checking thesaurus again. There is really no other word for ""predictable"" that wholesomely describes Kismat Konnection's story, dialogues, character transformations, etc, etc, etc. The title clearly says that it's all konnected by kismat. So, no points for asking why it is set in Canada (or should that be Kanada?)Which also means that you are demented if you complain about all the happy coincidences when boy meets girl, loses her, wins her back or maybe not. But looks like, asking for 'unique' coincidences is asking for too much. Movies like these have been our staple diet when we were growing up, dear movie makers! It's high time you begin respecting that and show us something more. And just zip up on the tacky symbolic lights-out-luck-down, lights-on-fate-bright bit! It truly makes my eyes hurt from rolling.And the dialogues have the same effect, when my brain involuntarily says out the words two seconds before the characters do. Before, I can control it from doing so. Hell, let alone the dialogues, the lyrics of the songs are just prose set to tunes, and have no poetry. And, the music didn't work for me in the promos and didn't work for me while watching the movie. Well, it's not like this one doesn't have its moments. Juhi Chawla and the lines given to her had me in splits for the 7 minutes she was on screen. Then there's this one scene where Vidya Balan's character, Priya describes her idea of an ideal match, which culminates into a lovely romantic moment. But those are about the 9 minutes that I enjoyed in the movie. The other romantic moments are either as if no one in the movie's team has been romantic after the 80s (stuffed toys as gifts, p-l-e-a-s-e!). Or real romance is so cheesy that it's better to portray this dream world where a squeaky toy can make a heart-broken girl smile than think of genuine romantic situations.Vidya Balan is one actor who can convey sensuousness through her facial expressions and doesn't really need a 'hot' body to convey that. Which means you need no leather pants in your wardrobe, lady! She looks great though, or at least much better than I thought she would after Heyy Babyy. Thanks to the camera decisions of mostly focusing on her upper body and more so the charming face. And that's the end of intelligent or smart camerawork decisions. Because, the lighting had this uncanny way of making the streets of Canada look like they were studio sets. Or were they actually sets? And it's obvious that director Aziz Mirza has gotten so used to directing Shah Rukh Khan that almost through half the movie, I had to remind myself that it's Shahid Kapoor I'm watching. And it completely doesn't work when he tried to pull an Amitabh Bachchan from Namakhalal by spouting fast monologues on a sport. But then, there's this thing that Shahid's eyes do that make you wish he gets the girl even if it's the most expected thing to happen story-wise. Yet the puppy eyes fail to convince me that he's this struggling architect who magically owns a largish house in Canada, a convertible, a large screen TV and yet is broke. So, you're not allowed to forget that the operative word in the title is ""Kismat"" - luck, fortune, destiny, whatever you would like to call it as the opening, boring voiceover monologue by Shah Rukh Khan reminds you. klearly kommon kismat konnection is more like it.]"
900,"[The ""Underworld meets terrorism"" tagline clearly seems like a marketing ploy to get the initial crowds into the theater. Because Contract has as much to do with terrorism as say, RGV ki Aag has to do with Sholay. (I promise this is the last time I mention RGV ki aag when I review a RGV product!) Having said that, if you're game for another vengeance-ridden protagonist who has a ""shoot at sight"" order from the director, this one is it. The story is fairly well-written and the characters are border-line caricatures but non-standard enough to grab your attention. First things first, as usual, I couldn't handle the random ""see my nostril hair"" super-tight close-ups. My complaint like always, is more against the randomness than with the actual close-ups. I must say though, that there are some scenes which could have easily used the standard over-the-shoulder editing, but instead, close-ups or mid-shots were interspersed with shots of both characters in the same frame. I'm not saying this is path-breaking, just saying it's a breath of fresh air from the extensive ""blackhead coverage"".Of all the departments of film-making, in Contract, the casting fascinated me the most. Many movies make me wonder about some of the decisions. What went through the writer's head? What was the interaction between the cinematographer and the director in this shot? Contractmade me very, very curious about the casting process. What must have the auditions been like? How did they pick the actor to absolutely suit the character? So many of them, new faces and none of them looked out of place. Now, the importance of the character in the whole scheme of things can be debated, but the actors were chosen well and almost each one did justice to the role given to them. Some of the characters were over-ridden by stereotypes set apart for them. For example, the main lead played by Adhvik Mahajan (Aman) had to have a wooden, sullen look just because no one thought of another way of portraying a peace-loving guy who has been hardened by the vagaries of life. Not to mention Adhvik's voice which is a complete turn down.For instance, Prasad Purandhare looked sinister in his opening shots as the cop trying to convince Aman into joining his ploy to get to the terrorists. So much so that I wouldn't have been surprised if he was behind the havoc in Aman's life in the first place. The very sight of loud characters get my nerves crawling up my skin. So, I think it's a huge compliment when I manage to not only tolerate them through the movie, but in fact enjoy their company for the first couple of times they are on screen. While credit does go to Upendra Limaye and Amruta Subhash who played the loud Goonga and his louder wife, it is equally shared by the way the characters are written and the things they are made to do even though they are not the focus of the camera. There is a certain rawness about the way things are handled in writing the sub-plots too. I'm sure you have always wondered why the protagonist, who is out to kill the villain, chatted him up first? You'll know why when you watch Contract. Because any other way and it looks too easy to be true. But, they deserve points for trying something different. While they let us see on screen is gritty when it needs to be, what we don't see but is implied has an effect on your nerves too. Then it maybe, the image of a wife-beater you create in your head or how you are blind to the visuals when the twist in the lyrics of an innocent rhyme, 'twinkle twinkle', hits you. The latter works more so because it is a child's voice has been used. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about creativity in the writing of the broader plot. It is a decent watch but ultimately there's nothing new in the story. Ram Gopal Varma on his blog mentions, Somebody asked me if Contract is a trilogy. I wouldn't say that, because trilogy sounds more like a finale and my intent is to make a hundredology of gangster films.I guess that's why, he's just touched upon the terrorism angle that's claimed to pervade into the underworld. After all there are 97 movies to go, what's the rush?]"
901,"[Like melodrama is to drama, Mission Istanbul is to pointless style. What with super-dangerous and mega-powerful villains walking like they are on a ramp, only waiting for the hero to get to them and start a fist fight. So what if only minutes ago, they had thousands of guns and gunmen at their disposal?Initially it did feel like there was some hope from the story writer, because the plot seemed non-standard. But ultimately, it's just another power-maniac villain doing what he thinks is best to gain and maintain that power. The characters are like those in any typical action movie - the stereotypical hero, his partner and a bimbette. So, here we have these ingredients in the form of a wannabe smart-Alec, a pseudo geek and a cleavage. Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit on the cleavage, so no need to rush to the theater yet, boys!You know there's no hope from the dialogue writer when two characters introduce themselves to each other by imitating James Bond. I can't even say it's downhill from there, because that's pretty much the bottom of the hill. It annoys me no end, when we have this really sharp villain who knows everything else but just can't spot our super-suave hero - in broad daylight! This is where the coincidences start getting to me and I almost checked whether my ticket stub said Kismat Konnection! When they show an ace journalist (Zayed Khan) as the only computer geek around, it just has to take the cake. By the way, this top-notch journalist of ours who loves danger has no clue that he can be bugged by the technically savvy villain. Fine, we can accept that the 'top-notch' bit is only the writer's imagination. But, hasn't this guy seen a single Hollywood action flick? GrrrrrSpeaking of stereotypes, another huge one is shoved down our throat, this time referring to an entire country. Is it really appropriate to show Afghanistan having an arms' market that looks like a vegetable market in any nook and corner of India? She's already a country in distress; do we need to show it worse than it is? And if it is indeed such a dangerous place what are tourists doing in the arms' market!? Aah...these markets are actually tourist attractions! Got it!! Seriously people, journalists would have some kind of protection/back-up plan when entering such a place. Also, I didn't think the cinematographer in combination with the editor did justice to either Afghanistan or Turkey. The tourist spots were covered rather hurriedly. I understand, this is no travelogue, but the beauty/ruggedness of the places was taken away from my eyes even before it registered. And I know these places have these qualities because other movies have covered them better. If only the camera focused more on recording these places as they deserve to be instead of accommodating style. Isn't it high time we stop using slow motion to imply 'style'? But, it has some 'laugh out loud' value when Zayed Khan understands the seriousness of the mission at hand. He says, ""he'll need some equipment"" and Vivek Oberoi and him pull out their sunglasses and put them on in ... slo-mo!!Interestingly enough, there was an attempt in the beginning to keep some continuity between the movie and the quintessential songs by say a one-liner like, ""Work done, let's party"" (though the work didn't look like it was done to me, but anyway...). Later they just gave up on their inhibitions and threw in a song. And yet had the gall to have a dialogue, ""There's no time for a love song!""The cinematic liberty of placing songs randomly, the 1000 coincidences that it takes to make this movie, the unreal characters all go to show how seriously they take the ""All characters in this film are fictitious, any resemblance to any person dead or alive is coincidence"" warning.]"
902,"[""The common man should have style too."" is an interesting concept to put forth. And to bring about that you have an ensemble of interesting characters. A rich, spoilt brat but he has business acumen, a fashion designer who cares for the common man, an honest advertising creative head, a fashion model, a popular TV actoress, and a loser who has an unbeatable positive attitude. And the attempt is by keeping the vein light. Unfortunately, ultimately nothing comes of the synergy they could create as a team or to them as individual characters.You're right, this is too serious an analysis for a movie in this genre and with this look and feel. But, every time I see a good idea blow up in execution, it hurts...And think about it? A comedy that squeezes out the sense of humor in you (believe me, I do have one!) Of course, the common man here refers to a person with no means to wear labeled brands, and has no sense of fashion. However, if the basic idea were thought through properly, it could have been extrapolated to so many situations where the common man suffers an unnecessary inferiority complex. This complex could be treated with something as simple as a product created just for him and by just being honest with him. Alas, if wishes were horses...If the elaboration of the story is amateurish, the other departments from screenplay, to dialogues, to their delivery, to the expressions on the actors' faces, to the ambience created around the actors, to the background music are equally amateurish.  It's really a shame that when half an hour is spent in establishing the 6 main characters and 2-3 side characters, in the end it all seems futile. For example, Aftab Shivdasani's character who's creative at coming out with advertising taglines, does nothing spectacular in the end! None of the actors are given anything out of their comfort zone and thus nothing seems more than below average. As we have it, Govinda fans could very well be disappointed too. I guess we should be grateful to Ganesh Acharya for deciding on limiting usage of Om Puri as a voice over. Otherwise, we know what he can be made to do in slapsticks such as these. But, that doesn't relieve us from Prem Chopra's antics. One can't get everything one wishes for. Yet, there can be no excuse for keeping him on screen for long spans of time with just one expression on his face. And this happened more than once, where nothing was happening on screen, even the camera wasn't moving! So yeah, some trimming was obviously called for. There are digs on various characters and issues you would encounter in your day-to-day life - Label designers and their attitude. Family soap operas, the camerawork and sound effects they use and of course, their viewers. Industrialists, the rich and their problems which have seemingly simple solutions. Telemarketers and how they annoy us. Popularity can make the commonest person a TV show host.I thought the non-jumpy movements given to the actors in the songs were nice, if only for being different. But, the placement of the not-so-good-sounding music is so abrupt that the 'nice' feeling comes too late in the song to register.As Manoj Bajpai, the guy with the ultimate positive attitude, says when he loses 80 lakhs in a business deal, ""I gained 1 crore worth of experience, I'm still in the green with 20 lakhs!"", anyone who sees the movie can say, ""they gained 1 crore worth of experience of not watching a movie that looks slapsticky and has a cheesy title!""]"
903,"[I wonder what director Rob Cohen thought when he set out to make this film, because watching it was a most nightmarish experience for this reviewer!We have had two Mummy films before, with lots of sand and desert and special effects and the blond Brendan Fraser playing Rick O Connell (a most spurious and contrived reworking of the Indiana Jones character), so what do you do for the for the third film of the series?You put in a Masala mix; throw in everything that you have got and hope it works.  So you have Yetis, you have an ancient shape shifting Chinese emperor played by Jet Li, a good witch played by Michelle Yeoh (was the director paying tribute to Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or was he attempting to create a similar film?) along with the hero and the heroine (ostensibly middle aged and retired from the profession of saving the world from Mummies) and their strapping son, and the elixir of Immortality: all of this set in the Himalayas, Shangri La, Shangai, and England in the 1940's.  You also have the mandatory special effects and crude attempts at comic relief thrown in.Unfortunately the film just sinks into a morass, and never rises above it.  I had hopes from both Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, but the director leaves them with nothing to do.  Jet Li is too wooden faced or clay faced to make a villain, Michelle Yeoh has about ten minutes of screen time.  The big climax is flaccid and looks like a lousy video game that you unfortunately cannot switch off. The action set pieces are highly contrived, and have nothing new to offer in terms of stunts or visuals, and the fight between Jet Li and Brendan Fraser is to put it simply, most doltish.Imagine Jet Li being defeated by Brendan Fraser in hand to hand combat, ha ha! It is high time the producers stopped raising the Undead Mummies, to extort money from the living!  Will someone put a curse on them for all eternity?]"
904,"[Take any romantic relationship where one in the couple is more involved than the other. Then, exaggerate it - sometimes a bit, sometimes quite a bit, almost always slapsticky - and you have Ugly aur Pagli. Now this movie too could be a copy of/inspired by some movie or the other. But, how does it really matter - because it's a story about you and me anyway. So then, is it inspired by life in general? Maybe. Except that it has to be fit in 2 hours and in between 4 songs! And however realistically you present an idea, if you are going to rush in a story in the last 20 minutes it's not going to be digestible.What is love? How does a crush become more than just a crush? When does a very good friendship turn into romantic love? If you can do 'anything' to keep the other person happy, would that be defined as love? But then, wouldn't you do 'anything' to keep your closest friends happy? These are not the questions that Ugly aur Pagli makes you think about, for these are not new questions, by any means. But these are the questions that it tries to play out.They are played out by simpleton Kabir (Ranveer Shorey) who does the weirdest of things just in the hope that Kuhu (Malika Sherawat) will smile genuinely. He wants to reach out to the darkness that Kuhu hides almost successfully with her eccentric attitude towards him. She in turn, leaves no stone unturned in having him embarrass himself. All of this is wonderfully carried off on screen by both Ranveer and Mallika. Yep! Mallika too! Of course, she can't cry or take the load of an emotional scene yet, but she's believable when in prankster mode. And she did manage to pull off the scenes in which she's snoring and/or drunk. But, then again, the complexities of her character were hardly shown to us, they were just told by way of a voiceover.Ranveer is simply cast very well to play the good-for-nothing, unconditionally smitten guy-next-door. Though, I must say I was OD'ed on his voiceover by the end of it. It's just always there! True it's his point of view, but it would have been great if his expressions did some of the talking too.That's it! There are no other characters!! I always wondered how Hindi cinema has very few 'pure' romance movies. There's always some family, career, some exterior factor weighing in on the dynamics of the relationship. So, here you go. You have a movie just about the twosome. And it doesn't turn out too well, mainly because what happens between them in the first 5 minutes is repeated for the next hour and a half, albeit with occasional witty dialogue. There's one idiosyncratic, a little over-the-top episode after the other. Then, suddenly there's a rush for an actual story and it shows in the writing almost as an afterthought.The songs too seem like an afterthought. The songs are so out-of-tune with the rest of the movie that you can almost sense the director's awkwardness in having them in there. It saddens me to see an actor like Ranveer resorting to coordinating hands, legs and the ""look-in-the-moving camera"" in the name of dance. And this, just because the audience wants its heroes to dance. Oh, by the way, can anyone inform Mr. Anu Malik that changing his name to ""Aanuu"" in the credits is not 'the' change needed. It's the music that needs to change! There are two things that I enjoyed though. One is the action sequences of the scripts that Kuhu writes. Although editing of the action doesn't let you actually get into the thick of things, just the stylization makes it worth watching. Especially because they are set around an otherwise low-budget movie. The other thing is the subtle tributes paid to movies of recent times, like Johnny Gaddar, Jaane tu..., Aamir, and I'm sure I must have missed a couple.Sure, Ugly aur Pagli is amusing at times, establishes one character really well, and has a raw appeal to it. But, then it has not-so-funny slapstick at other times, has a confused other character, and ruins the raw feel in the last twenty minutes.]"
905,"[What does it mean to be a Freak?How do we make an Ethical Choice which moves beyond the simply utilitarian?What do we do as citizens when our city is under Siege by forces that we cannot understand?How do we live in a world where the elected guardians of morality and justice are corrupt and venal?What does it take to be a Hero?Christopher Nolan poses these questions and more in his The Dark Knight, a film which is skillfully crafted and moves beyond ""the blow them up, throw them up"" genre of the Super Hero Blockbuster.Nolan's films seem to be primarily about troubled men; his stunning ""Memento"", ""Insomnia"", and later ""The Prestige"" were all about his lead characters grappling with their frustrations, desires, and their troubled pasts, as they struggle to lead a life.  In this film too, the two lead characters, the Joker and the Batman have to deal with a violent past - a past that is dominated by the Father.  For the Joker it is the vengeful, sadistic Father, while for the Batman, it is about the loss of the protective Father shot dead in a random street robbery.  Both are troubled men; both are fractured, and they choose different ways to deal with their respective legacies.The Joker's character is the Shadow Archetype; the repressed weaknesses, shortcomings, negatives, and the irrationality that we see in ourselves but do not accept, but instead project onto the other, the Villain.  The Batman is that part of us that struggles to do good, but is beset with internal demons and instinctual desires.  The Batman chooses violence to tackle crime, but that brings him face to face with his own Shadow, the Joker.  He has to struggle not to cross the limit, armed with his gadgets and martial arts skills; the Batman has to choose not to kill.  Compared to Jack Nicholson's Joker in Tim Burton' film, Heath Ledger's Joker oozes menace and mayhem.  Jack Nicholson was campy, goofy, and over the top, here Heath Ledger is violent and dead serious, if not downright psychotic. (The use of the knife as the favourite weapon of the Joker is a masterstroke).Christopher Nolan sets up the drama with finesse; both the Joker and the Batman become more and more desperate as they engage in their protracted struggle.  No one wins, in fact the struggle takes a heavy toll, people die, loved ones are lost for ever, and there seems no way out of the quagmire.  Into this impasse, Nolan introduces the character of Two Face aka Harvey Dent the District Attorney, the once White Knight of Gotham, who now has surrendered to the Shadow.Nolan's hand is muted and restrained: right from the back ground music to the dialogues, he handles things in an understated and subtle manner.  The supporting cast is superb; Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, the inimitable Michael Caine as Alfred, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, and Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon.  For Nolan, Gotham city is not a city of dread and mist and dark, a city that exists in never never land, but is instead recognizably real, filled with real people with real desires, anxieties, frustrations, and most importantly beliefs.This is not your usual blockbuster film where you ooh and aah at the loud sounds and action on screen in between mouthfuls of flavored popcorn and fiddling with your mobile phones.  With this film Christopher Nolan does for the Blockbuster / Super Hero genre, what Alan Moore's Watchmen and Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns did for the comic book: turn what essentially seems to be an escapist fantasy into a brooding and dark allegory for our world and our times.Watch this film as soon as you can and wonder at what a director with a keen sensibility can do with a good script and a vision without compromising on a cracker jack of a story.]"
906,"[Pre-emptive Note 1: Akshay Kumar fans - this review is not for you, so bugger off and come back with the brickbats after you've seen the movie! We're warm to one and all around here. Pre-emptive Note 2: This reviewer has a brain which she refuses to leave behind any more. I am a part of the masses that take pride in using their intellect - pseudo or not! * * * Phewww! That felt good!!* * *So, you pretty much know where I'm headed with this one, right? But, let's be fair and talk about the nice things first. The wit induced in the charming-yet-rugged Punjabi-inflicted-Hindi dialect brings smiles. Akshay Kumar does dutiful justice to his Mr. goody-two-shoes, flat character, like he's been doing for ages - be nice, dance, preach, dance, and dance some more. At least the character is consistent! Puneet's character played by Ranveer Shorey is a refreshing change from the regular loser, third person in a love triangle. After a long time in Hindi cinema, this third person has a spine. He actually seems worthy of our darling heroine. I also enjoyed Sonu Sood's dead look. And yes of course, Katrina Kaif looks her charming self. Period. Period to good things that can be said. Dubbing must be one of the most difficult things an actor has to do and that's why I admire it when most of our actors manage it so well. But, Katrina is just so off! We all know the lady can't speak Hindi. But, she doesn't even attempt to lip-sync in the songs!!Not to mention, the songs themselves are off. The lyrics sound like random Panjabi lines strung together. I didn't enjoy the music or the choreography. The picturization of a couple of songs are like bad tourism ads for Egypt. The raw beauty of those places has not been captured, only an attempt has been made to glamorize them. I always thought the camera, the sound, the background score are supposed to add to the charm, the ambience of the scene. They are supposed to produce a rhythm, work in tune with each other. But, here they are merely performing a function as if their usage wasn't given more than a single thought. So all they end up adding is chaos to the mayhem.I digest that a woman travels all the way from Australia to Cairo to study criminal law. I try my best not to question the umpteen inconsistent side-characters who change their view according to the need of that particular scene. And I give the same treatment to police bringing an underworld Don's friend to him in Australia.I don't question the gravity defying parachute. I accept Superman flying, so I welcome a super-villain who can make the parachute take a u-turn. I even smile at a person holding electrical wire in his bare hands while he's electrocuting others. I satisfy myself with just raising my brow when people are consuming alcohol openly *while riding* in a convertible in a pre-dominantly Muslim country. Egypt is relatively liberal, I say, because I'm supposed to sit back and enjoy.Enjoy what? One person pissing on another's face? A table fan threatening a crotch? A random scene with people playing cricket patchily edited and forced in between two other random scenes - just so that the third person in the love triangle can get all jealous when a couple end up lying on each other while trying to grab a catch?The opening disclaimers included lines to the effect that, ""The hen in the hen chase scene is digitally crafted, no cruelty has been imposed on animals for the shoot of that scene."" Uhh...what about the cruelty inflicted upon us the humans who watched this tripe in the name of 'mass entertainment'?    ]"
907,"[Once Aditya Chopra is done patting his back and reminding us that he's the man behind Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge and once you get back into the habit of not looking for a reference to a Yash Raj film, the story begins to emerge. Women with strong characters and a fairly mature portrayal of relationships are the two things that Bachna Ae Haseeno can surely boast about. Ad: Buy Hindi and Bengali DVDs &amp; VCDs at Induna.comFalling in love is almost always a random occurrence in Hindi movies. You just ""come...and fall in love"". But Bachna Ae Haseeno deals with the complexities and the process of how the characters are led-on and betrayed, how they hurt, how long the healing process takes, and ultimately how all the relationship needs is closure.I'm a sucker for even relatively coherent plots. And here I have two! Ideally I would be ecstatic. But - yeah, obviously there's a but - it's only the overall stories that are pretty neat and novel. The details that add up to the pretty bird's eye view of the stories are very ordinary. Also, this third story hanging around is so lame that it begs for negative marking. There are these other subtle things that blended pretty well into the story. Raj (Ranbir Kapoor), the boy whose only focus in life is to woo a girl because he's in Europe, grows into a person who would do what it takes to maintain his independence. Then he smoothly turns into a mature person who's ready to introspect and bear the burden of his responsibilities. For this you have to tolerate Ranbir's boyish chuckle and puppy eyes, though. To be fair, there are glimpses of very good timing, especially post-interval when he's reacting rather than being the center of attraction. He has the boyish charm because of which the audience feels for him, despite his character doing the meanest things to people around him.The women, each in their own right have a whole range of emotions to play around with and do pretty good justice to them too. Interestingly though, the character arc for each one of them is such that each one has to play smitten, confident, fun-loving, hurt, vengeful, shrewd at some point or the other and they all have the same way of expressing these emotions. So, an indignant  Minissha looks exactly like the indignant Bipasha or the attitude that Bipasha throws around feels very similar to the attitude Deepika is wearing. Almost as if, the briefing they were given related to only one character. And yet the characters are all different. So, what's going on here? We have pretty good performances. Though Deepika's voice doesn't vary much and her dubbing doesn't match the intensity with which the lines are said. But I absolutely enjoyed Bipasha's track - both, due to her acting, and the way her character is written. Minissha Lamba's story is actually the most charming of the lot. The characters in general are pretty well-detailed. Yet the film fails to touch in absolute terms. For one, the structure of the story is too episodic. Granted the chapter-like feel is intentional but it cut the movie too sharply into 20-25 minute pieces. Individually, these pieces don't always work either. The first two pieces in fact, feel like a set-up for the actual show. And they certainly need better lines than ""we're abroad, we can't miss a train"" (what does that even mean!?). Lighting a thousand candles and wiping off smudged kajal (eye make-up) from your girl's eye somehow don't generate chemistry automatically. The sincerity in the eye contact, the stance of the body, the way the two bodies hold each other are all missing in most instances. Even a nice human being can brutally mistreat the person who has wronged them. But if the mistreatment is exaggerated, with the sole purpose of arousing sympathy of the audience, it gets irritating. Ultimately, the climax kills the otherwise decent plot. It's rushed and thus dissatisfying. Aditya Chopra/Siddharth Anand come up with fairly non-standard (in Hindi cinema) concepts. These concepts revolve around the situations that the urban population in the mid-late twenties faces. You can almost see the concerns change over the years. Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge - Dil To Pagal Hai - Hum Tum - Salaam Namaste. And now the love vs. marriage debate. They take a very contemporary and relatively mature look at the problems and then cop out! They literally chicken out so that we don't feel too bad while walking out of the movie. That's sad because we as an audience are ready to take it, now. Then, there are these other things like having only one song before half-time which is picturized with Deepika Padukone. No doubt, this one is the typical good-locale-let's-dance-here kinds. But, if put in context with the placement and styles chosen for the two other songs with Minissha and Bipasha, you figure that its not without purpose, is very much in line with the subtext of the story and relates to how the male lead character feels for these women.]"
908,"[The characters do things abruptly, the story leaps from one point to the next without giving the audience any clue. It reads like chapters of a book with each chapter ending in a cliffhanger. However, when you start the next chapter you realize that the cliffhanger was not such a big deal after all. I don't want spoon-feeding, but some hint of the transitions that the characters and their relationships are making would give the narrative a much needed flow. Soha Ali Khan, Shiney Ahuja, Rajat Kapoor, and Vinay Pathak are all good actors. But, here they come across as just going through the motions. It can be claimed that the movie is not really a story but just a comment on the lifestyles of the people it is about. But, for that to come across too, a certain amount of insight into the character is necessary.Khoya Khoya Chandrevolves around Nikhat and her relationships. But by the time you have figured that out, you have lost interest. Mainly because the screenplay meanders around trying to show everyone's point of view. I usually enjoy movies/stories narrated from various points of view, but here not one view is fully fleshed out. Even Nikhat's character doesn't seem completely thought out.Isn't it a shame that after spending over two hours with Nikhat you have no clue what she feels for the other characters in the movie? Or is that how she is? Clueless about her own relationships? Either which way, you couldn't care less. The chops from one scene to the other are also very distracting. Before you can sink your teeth into what a character is trying to say/do/feel you are led straight into the next episode. I very rarely question why a person falls in love with another person. You know - ""love happens"". But, after having blindly accepted that, I think I deserve a peep into how the couple spends time together and how they grow apart. Nope, no such luck. I am just told, by way of plain dialogue or glycerin-filled eyes what transpired after the last scene. Khoya Khoya Chand is also about emptiness in the lives of people, more specifically of people that work in the film industry. It also shows the fallibility of the ""stars"" as people who are portrayed larger than life in reel-life. The irony is staring you in your face. Uh...so what? We know that. Our ""star"" who played the oh-so-lovable Munnabhai is in and out of prison for being involved with terrorists for goodness sake! However, I'd like to thank the director for taking us to the charming 50s-60s. (Except for the title song - which is the best, but it seems a little modern compared to the setting of the rest of the movie.) Especially the songs - music, lyrics, presentation. The music and lyrics are truly refreshing.Yet, I saw no specific reason for it to be set in the 50s. It might as well have been a present-day story. True, there are tributes to various actors, directors, music directors of that era. And there certainly must have been a few that I missed because I am not completely aware of what was happening in the personal lives of people from that era. Any which way, I found the lives portrayed very one-dimensional, very ordinary.And the other technical aspects are extraordinarily bizarre. The light seemed to be coming in from the weirdest places and gave many scenes a very artificial look. There were way too many close-ups and almost no on-location sets. It made me feel like I was trapped in low-budget Bhansali-land. And when the camera wasn't closing in on faces, it was going around in circles for no particular reason. More so, towards the end of the movie. Put together, they didn't create any impact at all. And what exact purpose were the time-transition title cards serving - ""One month later"", ""two months later""? Were they supposed to imply that whatever was shown after the last title card happened in one day? However, the title cards in the end said loud and clear, ""this is where we ran out of money, so sorry - story finish. khel khatam, paisa hajam (money digested, game over). Tata. Good bye. Go home."" Haven't seen a more abrupt ending in the recent past.As I write this review, I am running through the movie again and again. It's a Sudhir Mishra product. There must be some larger point, where is it hiding? Or maybe the point is to show the pointlessness of existence. If so, it doesn't interest me, and so this one was clearly not for me.Parental guidance: When there is a good chance that adults might get bored, I doubt children are going to sit through it. Besides, the story is about adult relationships. Visually there are a couple mild love scenes.]"
909,"[Stories that don't have any characters that you can feel for are mighty difficult to narrate. And it is the narrative style here which though different is a bit overdone. So, while the plot refrains from spoon-feeding (thank you!), the leaps in the otherwise stylistic narration take away a bit of the crispiness. The non-linear narrative keeps you alert but gets in the way of character development. Which is why the gray characters seem distant. You can't sense their desperation. That none of the characters are wrong and no one is certainly all right is beautiful. But, before you begin to get the nuances of the character and sense their frustration, the narrative shifts to another time or place or both. This is very disorienting, especially towards the end.Besides that however this technique of story-telling is used effectively to pique interest. The hard work that goes into the details of editing is apparent. Where exactly to cut from one sub-plot to the other is ever so important in such a movie. While these cuts worked at most times they seemed to have adversely effected the pacing towards the end. Strangers offers another great performance by Kay Kay Menon. And it is a pleasure to see Jimmy Shergill in a role that does his talent justice. It is to their credit that understanding what their characters were feeling, at any particular moment, needed no words. The relatively sparse dialogues are smart and at the very least cliche-free. The women on the other hand are not given enough room to showcase their capabilities. It seemed as if a lot less attention was paid to their roles and lines, which translated to lesser screen-time. It was nice to see use of handheld camera where it made sense, to create effect. E.g. in the train shots. Use of close-ups to bring focus to the expressions of the speaker at dramatic moments seemed purposeful and thus created the necessary impact. The lighting too was used tastefully. The decision to go the stylistic narrative route at a slow pace along with a 90 minute run-time has taken its toll on character development. An interesting plot loses steam because of the urge to do too many things in too little time. Parental Guidance: The basic concept of the movie is extra-marital affairs and the tone of the movie is very serious. However, there is no on-screen sexual or violent content.]"
910,"[How can one not love a movie about children crafted with utmost compassion - children with special needs at that? But, is that the only reason I liked Tare Zameen Par? Maybe - maybe not. What I know for sure is that a strong one-line story is narrated extremely charmingly. It is truly uplifting when spirit wins and yet, it is not all about the spirit of winning.Tare Zameer Par is about a child who suffers because no one around him recognizes that he is a slow learner. The beauty of the narration is that the message applies to all children - learning disability or not. How can creativity not deserve a place in academics?  It also points a very subtle finger at how we build conformation in our system right at the roots.The pace of the first half gives you time to think of normal children who are just not academically inclined.  The resolution in the second half, however, comes by too quickly compared to the trauma shown earlier. But, I guess, if the point is to show that difficulties can be overcome, you don't necessarily want to show how difficult it is to overcome them. About 45 minutes post-interval, Darsheel Safary (Ishaan) said a line which made me realize that he hadn't said a line in the last hour or so. There I was feeling sorry for Ishaan, feeling like yelling at someone to give him a big hug while I fought this lump in my throat that had been there for the longest time. All this based solely on Darsheel's expressions and body language! Kudos to the director for taking this decision and many such with brilliant confidence. And, finally we have a dialogue writer who knows when not to give the actors a helping hand. There are a couple of verbose, preachy scenes. But, they made the point because they were well written. Aamir Khan's entry into the movie seemed over-the-top and forced, mainly because it was in absolute contrast with the tone of the movie thus far. But after a little while you realize that you can't distinguish between the actor/director Aamir Khan and his character Nikhumb. They are both fighting the same cause. Passionately. The other characters serve their purpose as caricatures - stereotypical father, loving mother, understanding sibling, ruthless teacher, and jeering peers.No matter who or what the focus of the camera is, the love it feels towards its subjects shows in each frame. And, in turn, you fall in love with what you see on screen. Compositions, lighting, angles, colors all work successfully together to engross you and very often to enchant you. The lingering camera might have added a good 10-15 minutes to the run-time. But you will be hard-pressed to point out exact scenes which the movie could have done without. Everything is building character or atmosphere or both.The songs too contribute to the narrative. The lyrics are sheer poetry. I know-I know, that's what they are supposed to be, but can't remember the last time lyrics brought me to tears. ""mein kabhi batlaata nahi"" kept me speechless (and we all know how difficult that is!). And rock-style guitar strumming to a kids' song - that's what I call creative. Yes, that dash of seemingly inevitable melodrama exists. The side-characters transform for no apparent reason. The climax is exaggerated and is as unrealistic as it could get. However, the aim is to show not reality of life but reality of the condition that this child suffers from. Once you get that, you pardon the make-up a mother is wearing at 6 AM while doing her chores. And anyway, most of this is towards the end, by which time you are willing to forgive. Because, above all else, it makes you think.When did we grow up? When along the way did we forget what it felt like to be yelled at, to be put down, to be ridiculed? And why did we choose the next generation for revenge? Will we recognize the child in us that is struggling to get out? Will the sensation that the lump in the throat created, stay after the credits roll?]"
911,"[Why are we supposed to be entertained by suspending our sense of reason? Why is a few laughs considered ""worth it""? Why is ""time-pass"" good enough? Why is one forced sequence after another called a script? Why is comedy dictating the situation, instead of comedy flowing from the situation?Save a couple of one-liners here and there, there's nothing enjoyable about this slapstick. Unless you are the kind who enjoys patting yourself on being able to accurately predict what the writers have in store. The male cast does not surprise, in that they do exactly what they have been doing in every slapstick. So, while they do their bit well, not many viewers would object to them choosing worthier scripts.  Except for Feroz Khan. It almost felt like the makers didn't think anyone in the cast was worthy of first billing. So they got Feroz Khan to blow his trumpet to justify and take the lead in the opening credits. Katrina Kaif fulfills expectations. She satisfactorily basks in the glory of the light thrown on her and giggles to fill in for lack of lines. Mallika Sherawat on the other hand, seriously does well as the designated flirt of the movie.Technically the movie is plain awful. To start off, it makes liberal, blatant, and shabby use of the blue screen. It might have been just about acceptable if it were just the first two. But in combination with the third the visuals are just disastrous. The camera work, especially in the beginning, looked like the cameraman was testing out the properties of a wide angle lens. The non-existent editing just adds to the woes. Continuity gets step-sisterly treatment a little too often. No effort seems to have been taken even to match the colors between shots in a few sequences.Some of the songs were chopped off absolutely abruptly too. Not to mention that their placement makes no sense whatsoever. And what a waste of Malaika Arora's dancing skills! Why did they refuse to spend on decent choreography instead of the cameraman's voyeurism? Okay, you don't need to answer that.I trash another slapstick. What more could you expect from a person who can't enjoy masala movies even after disowning logic?]"
912,"[Whatever you do, you shouldn't make a kids' movie that drones and bores. Okay, granted, I am not an authority on what bores kids, especially considering I am not one anymore. But I have a strong feeling this will not work for kids. First, kids are exposed to much better animation. Cannot fault the makers on this one. Because given the budget constraints, visual creativity has been used to the optimum. But, would kids really care about ""value for money""?Second, for a regular good vs. evil story, this one has too many characters. I am not underestimating the average kids' intellect. It's just that except for 3-4 characters, none of the others are well-established. This doesn't give enough material for kids to love or fear the characters.Third, all the humorous spoof-like references to hindi movies of the 70s or cricketers or politicians, will be completely lost on kids. So, could that mean that the movie is not for kids? What's in it for the adults, then? The idea is novel and thus interesting. But, the execution is haphazard and abrupt. The writing too is not the best. Mythology becomes fantasy becomes drama which suddenly becomes an outright preachy social message. And thus no justice is done to any one theme. The songs are just about average and I couldn't hear the lyrics because the music was way too loud compared to the voices. The music builds-up well but lacks a punch at the end of the songs.That said, some of the lines and situations are very funny and some of the visualizations very creative. There are a few metaphors too. But overall, it suffers from not having a specific target audience. In its attempt to have something for everybody, it ends up becoming nothing in particular for anybody. Of course, adults and kids are not mutually exclusive targets as an audience. But, unfortunately, the bits for adults in Return of Hanuman will be enjoyed only by adults and same goes for the parts that kids would enjoy. Thus, overall, it is one of those which you would want the option of multi-tasking with. At home along with work or play and a movie on in the background.]"
913,"[Political dramas need a strong message backed by some power-packed dialogues and situations. And this is in addition to the regular requirement of well-thought out characters and a crisp screenplay. Halla Bol instead, has a regular message packaged shabbily around lame dialogues and contrived situations. Moreover, you don't feel for the characters and the screenplay is tedious for almost all of the runtime.My  biggest problem was with the writing. The transformations of characters seemed more convenient than believable. And this applied to not only individual characters but groups of people as well - say the media or the general pulse of the country's population. The many real-life references seemed like a list of people and situations in the industry that needed to be caricatured. Just for the sake of it, with no particular purpose in mind.The use of flashbacks in an attempt to create interest was a deterrent for me. For an already badly written character, unnecessary non-linearity in the first half just added to the lack of flow. Not to mention, right from the beginning the events seemed obligatory and rather superficial.  Each event was laboriously explained where subtle hints would have done the job much more effectively. There was ample scope for hard-hitting, forceful scenes but, except for two places, the opportunities were not utilized. Again, barring those couple of sequences, the dialogues were predictable. And on most occasions the predictability was because of the unnecessary pauses, which gave the audience time to think ahead of the lines. Many scenes were way too verbose. The few decent lines were also marred by very plain dialogue delivery. I attribute most of these flaws to the director. Because we have certainly seen much better performances from both Ajay Devgan and Vidya Balan, in similar roles. And while Pankaj Kapoor did a decent job, his character too became across as monotonous and one dimensional towards the end.Yet another issue with the writing was the pace. With particular distaste for too many camera movements and pacy editing, I never thought I'd ask for quicker cuts. But this one so badly needed it. The lingering camera became way too annoying and gave a feel of immaturity. And when the cameraman had fits of creativity, he took pretty shots and inserted them in the movie randomly.Again, brilliant occasions for compelling music and lyrics were taken over by dull, lackluster songs. The qawali was outright boring. The songs seemed to exist in the movie just because.30-40 minutes shorter, crisper dialogues, a better issue to address, and more thought into the flow of events might have made this a better movie. All-in-all loads of room for improvement in direction. The only reason not to completely trash the movie is that we have seen worse, much worse.]"
914,"[...actually it is. It attempts to be a comedy but succeeds at not making you laugh even once. It is a same-same romantic story but is different because it doesn't make you go ""aaaaawww"" once. It is also different from other Nagesh Kukunoor products. While Hyderabad Blues was just about average and Iqbal was a regular story presented well. Teen Deewarein and Dor(though copies) were certainly worth writing home about. Bombay to Bangkok however is one of those you feel ashamed about...let alone because you made it, you wouldn't want people to know you have watched it. How amateurish is it to have a 25-30 year old song play every time a certain character comes on screen!? So not funny, and such a sad way to romanticize anything. To add to the mayhem, voiceovers are used to avoid actual narration and shabby dream sequences appear to annoy. Making a brainless flick is an art. An art that is not easy to master. Even if you accept sexual references, toilet jokes, stereotyping, etc. as indispensable part of slapstick, you need something extra to keep them together. The movie has to have a driving force. Watching Bombay to Bangkok made me feel as if everyone is just going through the motions, no one is really interested. The cameraman just seemed to pick a few angles and the director played ""eeny-meeny-miney-moe"" to decide on the final shot. The editor seems to have been chopping stuff in his sleep. Only that can explain why some shots never seem to end and others are way too abrupt. The background music is pretty random too. Waltz replaced by some jingle-like tune for no rhyme or reason. Like everything else the script too is not completely thought out either. After an east meets far-east basic concept, the rest seems to be just written sporadically - while thinking of a thousand other things. The screenplay like its character is just running from one situation to another without any connection in between. An aimless, listless approach.Having said that, the cast does all it can to rise above all the flaws and does whatever best it can, given the constraints of a mediocre team. What bothers me most is that Nagesh Kukunoor, arguably one of the better film-makers in the industry, has shown such a thoughtless attitude to film-making. It is truly disheartening to see him struggle and fail miserably in trying to fit into the mainstream.]"
915,"[Why is subtlety so underrated? Sunday could have been so much more had it been a little less zealous about showing itself off - by misusing the music, giving the colors an extra-shine, and the overall video-album like tone of the movie. The basic premise is not bad at all, and the writers manage to squeeze in a social message too. However, the 'whodunit' script can't escape the usual suspects - the never-ending chase, the ill-placed songs, and the stretch-till-after-it-breaks rubber-band climax. Keep in mind that I am trying my best to overlook the improbable situations, the continuity lapses, and the glaring loopholes. After all, it's a senseless comedy which is at least making an attempt at sense. Got to give credit where it's due.What makes Sunday worth a lazy Sunday afternoon watch is its sense of humor. It ranges from mundane to tongue-in-cheek to witty to hilarious. And the lines are carried off well by the cast - from the top (Ajay Devgan) to the supporting cast (Vrajesh Hirjee). Most of the characters have individual characteristics which help the audience identify them. This is in contrast to characters from other such movies where any character could be replaced by the other. It's the other technical aspects which pull down the movie to very low levels. The background score is truly overwhelming and at times completely taking on the workload of all the action - the comedy, the drama, the fight sequences. In all likelihood this was a purposeful decision, but I think the humor would have been better supported if the background music stayed in the background, instead of being in the face and making sure you notice how many songs from yesteryears the makers know. The camera angles were all over the place and the cuts too many - which can be called stylish if you are watching a 5-minute song on MTV, but not so if it is a 2+ hour movie and you are watching it on the big screen. Also, the decisions of when to use black-and-white and when to bleach the reel seemed rather random. However, some of the transitions were interesting and creatively executed.One thing that can be surely said about the songs when you have two item numbers is that they are going to be arbitrarily placed. And Tusshar Kapoor for an item number - now that's what I call creative! Music and lyrics are something that you wouldn't remember a couple of minutes after they are over. I see Sunday as something that could have been much better. Especially, considering it had decent dialogues - an essential for comedies - and an adequate cast to pull it off.]"
916,"[The plot twists in Checkmate indeed make your grey cells twist and turn as they would in a game of chess. Unfortunately, the events develop at a pace that unplugs you instead of getting you hooked. Also, since the non-linear narration is not from any particular point of view, the twists seem random and all over the place. This makes the non-linearity itself rather haphazard.The base story takes its own time to formulate and settle down. On the way it develops the main characters' frustration with their situation. However, the different traits of these characters are not given full vent. And thus, the initial character development seems in vain. Unfortunately, yet again, the only way a woman can achieve anything is by using her sexuality, however intelligent she is. The actors playing these characters also give no earth-shattering performances, but neither does any one of them make you pull your hair apart. Each one is just doing his/her bit. The voiceover narrative style used throughout the movie gives the feel of watching a choppy chain of events rather than a story flowing from one plot into another. However, it was a nice touch to have the voiceovers pass judgments about other characters also, rather than just narrating the story.My basic problem is with the pace of the movie. A thriller has to be on the move. It cannot pause to take a breather; it cannot stop on seashores just because. A pause has to be about something, it has to be pregnant, has to do something via the background music or the camerawork. But here the pauses just exist because the director thinks he is building suspense. Nope...tedium he is surely building.Had it been shorter by 15 minutes, it could well have been worth a watch. But people crossing and double-crossing and double-double-crossing till they themselves lose track is pretty annoying by the time the end credits roll.]"
917,"[With impeccable timing, 'Michael Clayton' arrived just in time for the Academy Awards. It was nominated for seven Oscars, and to be fair, it's not hard to see why.Director (and writer) Tony Gilroy keeps the action low but the tension high in this well-paced legal thriller. Gilroy's previous writing credits include the 'Bourne' series and 'Devil's Advocate', but with 'Michael Clayton' he gets to assume the director's chair and shape the movie to his liking. George Clooney gives a strong performance in the title role, playing a corporate lawyer increasingly torn between loyalty to his friend and colleague (Arthur Eden, played by Tom Wilkinson) and to his employers. Things are further complicated by Clayton's fractured personal life - seemingly de rigueur for male Hollywood protagonists these days. Although he didn't win this time around, if Clooney keeps putting in these performances (and stays clear of more 'Oceans' movies) he's likely to land an Oscar sooner or later, and although the role of Michael Clayton isn't as meaty as say, Bob Barnes in 2005's 'Syriana', there's still plenty for him to work with.The film is set mainly in New York City, although we get to see completely different side of the city to that we see in American Gangster, for example. Here, the villains are - for the most part - tucked away in their skyscraper offices, part of the sinister system so lucidly described by Wilkinson's Arthur in the film's fabulous opening monologue.Perhaps the best word to describe the movie is 'understated'. There are no actors chewing the scenery here. Instead, there are solid performances throughout the cast. Particular credit goes to Tom Wilkinson as Arthur and the excellent Sydney Pollack as Clayton's sympathetic boss. Tilda Swinton does a fine job of portraying senior lawyer Karen Crowder, struggling to maintain a cool facade despite the pressures upon her. With George Clooney and his 'Ocean's Eleven' pal Steven Soderbergh both credited as Executive Producers, perhaps it's no surprise that 'Michael Clayton' looks slick. Expensive yes, but not flashy - in keeping with the tone of the movie. Similarly, the subtle soundtrack (a chord-heavy piano score) suits the mood well. Again, it's slick.Gilroy touches on some interesting themes. We're reminded that the role of the lawyer is to represent their client - not necessarily see that justice is done. But at what cost, and where to draw the line?There are layers here too, as Gilroy lightly plays with a fantasy sub plot. However, Gilroy keeps the main story within the realms of possibility. In a post-Bhopal world - where 'cost-benefit analysis' acts as corporate doublespeak for profits over human life - is the film's U-North any different from Union Carbide? Similar ground has been covered before - most recently in Michael Mann's 'The Insider' (1998) but Gilroy manages to keep things fresh while simultaneously harking back to some of the great American thrillers of the 1970s. And of course, they picked up a few Oscars too...]"
918,"[Haven't we had an overdose of movies based on religious fanaticism and associated terrorism already? May be not...Okay, haven't we had more than our share of stories told in the same mundane fashion? I say enough already!First credit where it's due. The base story is not bad at all. It has its interesting plot-twists. The sub-plots sort-of flowed into each other too!! The other thing that I enjoyed was the music. Unfortunately, this list stops here.The battle is completely lost in the filling-in of the details. The characters cannot be called underdeveloped, but they are unbelievably one-dimensional.  One character is just shot out of the plot just about when his character could have done something interesting. It is hard to digest when a character behaves the exact same way when he is being friendly with someone and when a close relative passes away.  Even if he is the modern-day Gandhi. How can one be speechlessly grieving in shock in one moment and lecturing on tolerance in the other. Almost each character spieling out speech after speech on either tolerance or intolerance, doesn't help either. Each lecture consists of the same old, mind-numbing lines. Each line being repeated begs us to be thankful if they are two different sentences saying the same thing. Because at other times, the same words are repeated - asking us to be sympathetic towards the dialogue writer for being creatively-challenged. And one character who certainly shouldn't have been encouraged was the ""poet"" grandfather figure. The lyrics were just inane, sir, let alone inspirational. Anil Kapoor certainly has a wider range of expressions than this. Anurag Sinha again, has a great voice but a very monotonous style of delivering dialogues. Shefali Chaya should be admired for trying her best to maintain composure while playing a rather loud character. I would still blame the character development for the lackluster performances. They had a very good reason to pick a tone and stick to it - the script has no variation in their character!There is one redeeming factor in this whole set-up - we have seen much, much worse from Subhash Ghai]"
919,"[Usually in a movie which has a promo song running along with the opening titles, I block my brain from making any assessment - trying my best not to judge the proverbial book by its kitschy cover. But, the thought just wouldn't leave me. If this is how it starts, how do I go through the next two hours? And it worked! Thanks to the lowest possible expectations set in the first five minutes, it fidgets its way half-a-point up.It's regular slapstick with a dash of original one-liners thrown in. But, it feels like the one-liners determined the situation rather than the other way around. And the lack of flow is evident when you just shake your head in helplessness. This goes for both the dialogues and the screenplay, or lack thereof.This is one of those brainless comedies that can't be seen without a brain. As in there are three people with the same name who reach the same place at the same time. So keeping track of the chaos cannot be done without some gray-cell exercise. And, honestly, I did see this as a situation with tremendous potential for craziness. But, it's all too commonplace and just doesn't work out.Neither do the production values - from the amateurish animation to the art design. The costume designer is fascinated by the scissors. We have holes and cuts in dresses where they don't belong. Setting trends? I hope not! These over-used, blunted-down scissors were then passed on to the editor. Low-budget, you see? Can't blame him for the jerks and jolts now, can we? Now that so much is spent on putting the cut pieces of cloth together we need people to wear them. So we have the threesome - Sameera Reddy, Tanisha, and Esha Deol. Amazingly, and I'm using the word  with all sincerity, Neetu Chandra is wearing just one costume, and is covered all over at that! Maybe those scissors were too blunt for cotton clothing by the time it was Neetu's turn. Thank goodness for some mercies!Now that we have these ladies, what do we make them do? What women do best, of course...scream and screech and yell some more. Why distract the audience by giving them such things as meaningful dialogue? Consistent character would cause an outcry. To be fair though, in the name of gender equality, the men are dealt a similar hand too. Any hopes of Paresh Rawal saving the fort are demolished in the fifth minute of the movie where he is introduced as a bra seller. Need I say more?The only people who do recognize their limitations are the lyricists. Since, they know they cannot write that well, so they wrote a few half-decent lines and got them repeated over and over till Raghav Sachar's music ran out. The latter does put his goods on display and how. A range of foot-tapping music remixed together. And he takes showcasing a step further by featuring himself in the end credits.Barely different from the other slapstick churned out this shoddiness named One Two Three is absolutely passable. Waiting for next Friday, already...]"
920,"[Yes, it most certainly is a rehash of A few good men. The context has been Indianized effectively. And this despite including Indian movie-making elements like melodrama, out-of-context absolutely-unnecessary songs, difficult-to-digest climax, etc. The Rob Reiner courtroom drama is more about its characters, Shaurya is more about the issue it is trying to highlight. I would say the best way to appreciate the latter is by blocking out the former. After all, even if Kay Kay Menon is no Jack Nickolson, he still is Kay Kay Menon. Not impossible. Give it a try. Most of the first half is spent in building characters and you hardly know a fact or two about the case, army lawyer Major Siddhant (Rahul Bose), has to handle. Very deliberately then, the movie moves on to the strong point it wants to make - egos of people in power need to be punished for misusing that power to dominate over minorities (women, religious minorities, etc). This is, of course, done using only one of the minorities as a case in point. But the general application is confirmed when you read about various such cases where the same principle can be applied. It takes courage but it needs to be done.In my mind, it takes courage just to cast Jaaved Jaaferi in a non-slapstick role. It's no earth-shattering performance, but a mere exchange of glances showcases what this man is capable of. Rahul Bose with his casual-cum-sincere demeanor makes you believe the transformation his character goes through despite the gaps in the script. That you feel like slapping Brigadier Rudra Pratap Singh for his overconfidence and high-strung attitude, says it all about Kay Kay Menon. Now, why overacting is reserved for the women, is beyond me. Of course, I am not asking the men to overact too. But, it really makes me wonder about the kind of women moviemakers have in their lives? They get shrill to express excitement (Minissha Lamba) and are exaggeratedly listless when they are sad (Seema Biswas). Besides that, Shaurya's characters become believable not because of the way they are etched and shaded-in but because of the dialogues each of them is given. Each character is strongly opinionated but very rarely does one choose to lecture the other or the audience. The conversational tone might have a lot to do with the camera angles and compositions chosen. Tight close-ups or just having the speaking person in frame has been noticeably avoided. This makes it look more like a dialogue rather than a monologue even though there are relatively long monologues throughout the movie. Other than that the coverage of the scenic beauty, the editing, and the background music are very below average. Abrupt cuts are very disctracting. And did loud compositions ever work in displaying the character's internal conflicts? Had these things been a bit better, Shaurya would be a crispier, tighter output. Nevertheless, the story and dialogues supporting the story are strong enough to make a case for this one.]"
921,"[I can't decide what moved me more. The way in which the author's take on Islam - the use and abuse of the religion - unfolded, or that someone even dared to touch upon it so openly in the first place, that too in Pakistan. I think there would be very few makers for this kind of a story even in India - a secular state. And by the climax, I was amazed at the number of issues Khuda Kay Liye touched upon. We had the whole gamut. Atrocities faced by women at the hands of fellow-Muslims, double standards of Muslim parents living abroad (I have seen this with non-Muslim Indians too), injustice disseminated because of racial profiling, Jihadi's misuse of easily-influenced-relatively-meek youngsters to turn them into terrorists. Each problem is given its own space to breathe and develop.The parallels drawn between the racial profiling storyline based out of Chicago and all the other things happening in Pakistan were amazing. There are points where you can interchange the US law officials with the Jihadi leaders in terms of their unyielding attitude towards whatever they believe is the truth. How they all mince words to have people say what they want to listen to. And to make sure the audience doesn't miss the parallels, the similarities are directly shown towards the climax.The strong and clever dialogues had a huge role to play in the overall impact In the name of Godhad. I was wondering how much more effect it would have had on me had I understood the language completely. The use of Urdu is elegant, and at the same time not entirely overwhelming. Since the movie is more or less situation-driven you can make a fair guess from the context. However, there was a lack of the same aptitude in the departments other than story and dialogue. In particular, the editing was very abrupt and didn't render a smooth flow. The only exception was in the climax scene in the courtroom, where the cuts worked towards narrating the story. Similarly, while the songs were beautiful, the shifts in and out of western classical in the background music seemed pretty random. Most of the actors too came across as very stiff. Only, Shan (Mansoor) stood out with an excellent performance - from the inspired musician to a completely broken down man. Fawad Khan who played a confused youngster, Sarmad, did look aptly baffled. So it would be too soon to judge whether he can really enact other emotions. But, given the strength of the message all these shortcomings seem pardonable. The questions that I am left with are - Has it reached the right ears? Or at the very least have the people sitting on the fence convinced to keep from committing such heinous acts?]"

923,"[A movie set around the 9/11 bomb blasts and no overt messages being lectured across the screen! It's about Indians staying abroad, yet none of the typical cultural drama related to diaspora. Okay, I know this sounds like I liked the movie more because of what it was not, rather than for what it was. But, this movie is a simple love story set in the middle of the Hindu-muslim divide prevalent in the South Asian community settled in the US.In about 75 minutes, four characters and their situation are all developed reasonably well. In fact, in just two adorable scenes the romance Ali (Amit Sial) feels for his beloved is established. Also, director, Tanuja Chandra makes a very smart move by not telling us much about the relationship between Saloni (Mahima Choudhary) and Harry (Vikram Chatwal). It adds to the believability of what is to follow.Situations transitioned from one to another very subtly without too many dialogues. Characters were smart enough to understand the situation without the other having to spell it out for them. The audience too was treated with respect and not spoon-fed. I realized that I've become so used to melodrama when I felt relief at every point where melodrama could have been so easily resorted to. There were a couple of times when an awkward situation is built up to a pregnant pause, to be resolved with a simple one liner - straight just as is, without any ham-haw-ing. Having said that, a couple of character transitions happened a bit too quickly and thus tilted towards unbelievable. This could also be because the focus seemed to be on narrating the over-simplified story rather than presenting it from a particular character's point of view. This I thought is what created a certain distance between the characters and the audience. But, at most times you felt for the characters because of sincere performances from the entire cast. It was so refreshing to see Anupam Kher in a role that has his name written all over it. The pride, the joy, the grief, the hatred are all translucent for you to see through. Your hearts reach out to Mahima and Amit too. And I think this is the first time I have seen so many expressions on Suhasini Mulay's, otherwise stiff face. Like the style of narration, the camerawork was also subtle with minimal movements. Also, the colors used had a dull, yet realistic, hue. There were no bright colors staring at your face. In fact, the colors almost matched the stock footage used of the 9/11 blasts.Hope and a little sugar is a short and sweet story told well. The characters are charming and their treatment is thought out. But yet, there is this weird gap left by unexplained and super-quick transformations in characters and situations.]"
924,"[I thought a film marketed with a rugged look would be an action flick. But, surprise-surprise Tashan is an out-and-out comedy. The action makes you laugh, the romance makes you laugh louder, and it is so funny that the characters make you laugh even when they are seething with anger. And the beauty is I haven't been able to figure out whether any of this was intentional! Speaking of beauty, after a long time have I seen India shot so beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) were all saturated with color, alright. Nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there. But alas! Come action sequences, and the camera blows its horn too hard. It doesn't allow the audience to register the seemingly interesting stunts. Similarly, there were glimpses of interesting editing decisions. Like when a character says 'BITCH' with a long 'i' and the scene cuts to a long shot of a beach or when ""kabhi kabhi"" is playing and a car falls down a cliff when the song reaches ""tujhe zameen par bulaya gaya"" (you have been called to the earth) part. That the car flying in the air was very shoddily animated is a different story altogether.However, what really surprised me is that the four main characters in the film had actually different traits which were more-or-less consistently adhered to. What's more, each one had a story arc too!? - Very atypical of a Hindi movie in this genre.  An underworld don, a wannabe don with super-powers, a supposed simpleton, and a lady with a mission - all with brain and brawn. (yes the girl too! YAY!!) Sounds like a decent enough premise. But something grossly went wrong in the execution. And I could complain about artistic liberties taken, if only there was any art in sight.A big fat finger can be pointed at the dialogues. My fears came true, as in the word ""the"" was overused. I think the writer was pretty sure people are going to go off to sleep. Which is why the name of the movie is repeated every half hour - to orient the people who have just woken up! Also, Hindi-fying of English was done in such abundance that I was soon immune to it. So, while it didn't bother me, it didn't make me laugh either. Sure, there were obvious tributes to Deewar, Sholay, and Jaane Bhi do Yaaro. Would have been good if they were done well, though.What is amazing is that despite really lousy dialogues, each one of the four actors has given a good performance. Having the right expressions (exaggerated as they might be) to rise above the bad lines must be applauded in any case. Certainly, the roles must have looked interesting at script stage for established actors like them to give Tashan space in their portfolio. Of course, Kareena overshadowed the male trio put together in the ""looks"" department. By the way, am I the only one here to sense that Akshay Kumar and Saif Ali Khan are too old and too mature in this industry to flout their 'sexiness' in such an inelegant, uncouth way? The songs functioned like the snooze button for me. I felt like muting it off when a song started and suffered the familiar rude shock five minutes later when it ended giving charge to the louder background music. So loud that it overshadowed dialogue at many points. The lyrics, the choreography and of course the music, all seemed too generic and random.  Actually a level below generic. We can see Kareena not only sporting the golden ""Aishwarya look"" from Dhoom 2 but she also has a few of Aishwarya's dance moves! And why was Saif Ali Khan made to look like he couldn't dance to save his life? Despite the things done right, while leaving the theater I was praying that Vijay Acharya hadn't over-dosed me with whatever anesthetic it was he was using. The numbness I felt in the brain region was really scary. Anyway, all's good, I'm out of it and hoping to keep you away from it]"
925,"[I'm drawing a blank. There are some movies after which you draw a blank because they've left you spellbound. You don't know how to express the exhilaration you feel. Isn't it strange that you draw the same blank for movies that leave you numb. You are left listless after watching the random crap and have no clue what to do next. Just in case you haven't guessed it yet, Mr. Whilte Mr. Black does the latter.So, here I am, absolutely listless and numb in the head, don't know where to begin. I tried the usual - mention major positives first...genuine blank...true, there are a few things in the beginning that were ""not bad"". Like in the opening action sequence, the stunts and special effects are slick. But, the badly painted yellow car and the shoddy overuse of the blue tinge are extremely distracting. Then, I like the way we are introduced to the characters - no voiceover, no title cards, just plain episodes. What the characters are going through, defines them for us. But, the characters are so not interesting. I thought the days of having characters forced into the story with the sole function of playing comic relief were long gone. I guess I'm mistaken.The three women who are stylishly kicking men around in the opening sequence have no character sketch at all. They are just clones of each other. They have no dialogues, they enter-exit-reenter-reexit randomly. They haven't even bothered giving these women names. When the writer himself is hell bent upon belittling his characters, what story/character arc are we going to find? And exactly how often are we supposed to leave our proverbial brain behind?Now, when those are the positives, am I to be blamed, if I just feel like writing a one-word review, ""BAD""? What more can I be expected to say when Arshad Warsi, of all the people is so loud that you feel like having the usher mute the volume? For me, Suniel Shetty never worked as a simpleton. Somehow, his image and demeanor don't have anything village-like about them. So, if my problems start with casting itself, the list of things to complain about is just too long. Don't I need to be convinced there is a determining factor behind casting those particular six women, other than that they were ready to bare all?The music is as kitschy-90-ish as could be, and the lyrics are extremely generic. In fact, I think one of the songs almost worked as a lullaby for me. And I don't know where to look, if the idea of entertainment is taking a crane top-down shot of a swimming-trunk-clad Arshad Warsi lying down and doing the weirdest hand and leg movements (supposedly seductive(?))? And this surrounded by 50+ women wearing bikinis who are doing similar movements. And yeah, all of them are on striped beach towels. Very disturbing visually, believe me. So, yeah, I think I've said enough where one word would have sufficed. In the interest of brevity and saving both your time and mine, I would just say, get your ""to watch"" list out and watch a few of the movies on that list this weekend.]"
926,"[Many a time, storywriters use stories to put across their ideologies before their audience. Now, the writing style might be great, or at the very least likable. But, if a reader/viewer doesn't subscribe to the ideology, the writer has lost that one member of the audience. And with Bhoothnath, I am that member. I was a captive audience till it started beating the well-trodden path of stereotypes and meddling with religious issues. What I call religious issues actually borderlines on faith. Especially, if the specific Hindu rite mentioned is only symbolic of the idea that parents only need a gesture of acceptance, of love. While, it might not be far-fetched, I doubt that is what too many viewers will take away. The point being that instead of imposing religious traditions by using a particular practice as an example, if a larger, more global sub-plot was chosen, the point might have gotten through better. A lot of the blame could also go to the absolutely unforeseeable slack in pace and change in execution style. From creative and cute use of otherwise-oft-seen special effects, we are sent to a second half where the magical treats do a vanishing act. From a fun, adorable chain of events, we are suddenly thrown into a rather gloomy outlook of society. From a first half with two fairly well developed characters, we are abruptly introduced to new characters and their half-baked relationships post-interval. Fortunately though, the performances do not suffer from this inconsistency. Amitabh Bachchan plays the grandfatherly ghost, Bhoothnath, who won't let anyone stay in his house even though only his spirit can inhabit it. His comic timing is as impeccable as ever. Not to worry, Amitabh fans - the funny faces, the angst of a person who is worried for someone close, the grief-stricken eyes at the memory of a painful event - all are very much there, the debacle called RGV ki Aag hasn't taken any of it away from him. The only area where he came across as superficial was when the angry ol' man was required to be angry. Sad but true.Anyway, looks like little Aman, who plays naughty Banku, has taken a leaf or more from the veteran's book. Every time Aman Siddiqui came on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off his eyes - such innocence, such twinkle, such sadness - as and how the story demanded. Same goes for Juhi Chawla who plays her cheerful self, this time as a mother with an unbelievable sense of humor. But come scenes that require her to be anxious and her glycerinated eyes make her work seem effortless.I usually refrain from commenting on the special appearances, but Shah Rukh Khan's presence was a little more than just a special appearance. It wouldn't be unfair to say that he had more screen presence than some of the other side characters. Shah Rukh Khan plays Shah Rukh Khan Banku's father. The significance attached to his character's deeds seem like the parts have been forcibly blown-up to fit in the stature of the star. Now, whether he succeeds in performing his role of first-weekend promotional material, the box office will tell in a couple of days.Anyhow, after a long, long time Satish Shah and Rajpal Yadav actually made me laugh. But where did they disappear in the latter half of the movie. And there start my complaints. Keep in mind that I let go of the usual issue related to non-defined super-powers. As in, why does Bhoothnath show himself, if he doesn't want to be seen? So, every time, I saw a cool usage of graphics, I hoped that they won't overdo it, and they didn't. I was happy. Every time, it looked like the story is going to go into predictable zone, an unexpected line brought out loud laughter. I was happy. I thoroughly enjoyed the comment on TV soap operas. Things were going really well till my questions started getting answered. Then, I asked, ""Where's the conflict?"" There it came, not good, not bad...a little longer and this would have become too serious to match the tone of the movie so far. ""Where's Bhoothnath's backstory? What's his problem?"" And I asked for too much. The movie blindly nosedived into new characters with 45 minutes to go. One of them is Bhoothnath's son, who not only is introduced so late, but has a full character arc, rapid transition et al, albeit very under-developed. I found the little speeches a little too boring and the stereotype against Indian emigrants a bit too harsh. Ultimately, the resolution to the story as a whole was the biggest let-down of them all.All said and done, Bhoothnath surely deserves credit for not taking its younger target audience for granted. Well executed ""tributes"" to the animation used in the Harry Potter series, ensures that the kids get a quality product. If only, they had maintained it through to the end, if only...]"
927,"[Two of Kung Fu's greatest stars together in one motion picture; what more does an avid martial arts fan want?  Possibly an instruction manual outlining the secrets of the Buddha fist and the Hollow Palm technique!Jet Li and Jackie Chan star in the Forbidden Kingdom and since they are such big stars we get them twice over! Jet Li and Jackie Chan have both got double roles in this rollicking, adventure movie aimed at the summer crowd who would enjoy a good action fantasy. The script follows the format of the Journey of the Hero as outlined by Joseph Campbell, and is simple.  The director does not waste time in building character and goes straight to the point.  There is a bad guy, the Jade Emperor, and then there are an unlikely collection of misfits including a drunker scholar (Jackie Chan), a silent monk (Jet Li), a beautiful girl (Yifei Liu), and the teen protagonist (Michael Angarano), who is the only one who does not know any kungfu.    Throw in a white haired witch (BingBing Li) and what you have is a potent mixture.  The story is ostensibly based on characters from Chinese mythology and the characters exist to drive the plot.Unlike other Jackie Chan films, the tone of the film does not have too much of slapstick except in some sequences, and remains true to the Jackie Chan code of not showing blood and gore ( a principle that was ignored in Jackie Chan's film The Myth).  Jet Li is his inscrutable self in the beginning and then becomes comical possibly under Jackie's influence.  The title sequence of the film is over laid on posters from Kung Fu films of the 70 and 80' and one quickly recognizes Gordon Liu from 36 Chamber of Shaolin, and of course, the Boss - Bruce Lee.Having paid his tributes, the director then throws in references to the kung fu styles seen in thousands of films, with names like the Drunken Fist ( remember Jackie Chan's Drunken Master), the Tiger style, the Eagle ( Snake in the Eagle's shadow, again with Jackie Chan), and the Preying Mantis.Woo - Ping Yuen, the acclaimed martial arts choreographer of the Matrix and Kill Bill series, not to forget Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon delivers superbly.  He keeps the action restrained and does not go for over the top indulgences.  Thus we do not get to see people flying around and neither are there seemingly impossibly leaps and maneuvers.  What we get instead is good realistic action set pieces with superb kung fu: terrific blows, blocks, weapons of various sorts being deployed including jade darts and long hair, and the kung fu staple of leg to leg action.  The fight between Jet Li and Jackie Chan is terrific, with both heroes getting a chance to show off their skills to the hilt without over doing it.  Woo also keeps the fight sequences short and tight, thus keeping the average viewer's interest in mind.The film has none of the high philosophy and romantic lyricism of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; neither does it have the dark, brutal undercurrents of films like Old Boy and Romeo Must Die.  It is also not a classic kung fu chopstick film in that it does not have extended fight sequences in various kung fu styles and the standard ingredients of revenge and retribution.  What it does have is good fun, great fights, and two of the biggest stars of contemporary martial arts displaying their mastery.  It also has some Zen dialogues, and a message: a simplistic one perhaps, but one that will definitely warm the cockles of one's heart!]"
928,"[As the largest film making country in the world, we have not had indigenous versions of the Noir genre of films on our screens except for a short period in the fifties.  More power to debutante director Navdeep Singh for having the courage and the vision to give us what is possibly the finest noir film in an Indian language.Yes, in the fifties we had them for sure, notable amongst them being Baazi and Aar Paar, both directed by Guru Dutt, but they suffered from the fact that the mores of film making in India did not really allow the chief protagonist to be cynical, morally ambiguous, and deeply pessimistic about the world: a world that  was jaded and characterized by an acute loss of faith in 'universal' values of love and justice.The Noir (French for night, literally and figuratively standing for 'black film') genre gave us such Hollywood films like The Maltese Falcon and The Asphalt Jungle in the forties and fifties, and more recently the conventions of the genre have been reworked in neo noir films like the Coen Brothers' Blood Simple and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.So what does the director do here?  Navdeep Singh has crafted a film dripping with nuances of life in a small desert town, and has used the metaphor of the desert to suggest the aridness and sterility of the life of the chief protagonist, Satyaveer Randhawa, underplayed superbly by Abhay Deol.We have the character elements of the noir genre in ample measure: a morally ambiguous, loveless world, populated by cynical and apathetic characters each driven by their own lusts and greed, the femme fatale who is sympathetic to the hero, mysterious damsels in distress, the aging patriarch with his insatiable ravenousness for power justifying his actions by appealing to the ""natural order of things"", crooked cops, scummy goons, and nosey neighbors.The script is an inspired retelling of Roman Polanski's seventies noir classic Chinatown and to the director's credit, he does not hide it, but instead pays tribute to it in his own way by reworking the plot and some key scenes to suit his point of view.  He also throws in a direct reference to the original just to make sure you get the point.Unlike traditional noir films, the camera work does not frame scenes in stark contrasts of light and dark, with fog and or steam cloaking people in a half light, neither is the film set in the mean streets of a city lovingly photographed to make sure that all the grittiness and grime stand out.  Instead here we have the desert in all its harshness as well as in gentler moods, and scarred and pitted monuments serve as the back drop to existential ruminations and the unfolding of the plot.The camera lingers on the characters and their reactions; it frames the characters tightly, especially inside darkened rooms, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere that goes well with the dark machinations in the plot.The cast has done a good job: both Raima Sen and Gul Panag are competent, and Vinay Pathak is simply superb as the local Sub Inspector with his cynical outlook on life.The film does not have a climax in the conventional sense, which may leave a lot of people feeling highly dissatisfied, but a degree of redemption is achieved by the chief protagonist.  Satyaveer Randhawa is again not a hero, he is not the good guy who is absolutely honest and incorruptible, but as the film proceeds, we understand that he is corrupt too.  Evil is not vanquished in the end, neither does justice triumph.  Evil is something that is at best lived with, because it resides in us and not in the ""villain"".  All that we can do is to come to terms with it and with ourselves.For those who are looking for a typical ""thriller"" film with the ""good guy"" vanquishing the ""bad guys"", this film is best avoided.For those who like their life complex, their characters morally ambiguous, and would like to ponder on the workings of fate and existence, this is a film that you must see.]"
929,"[Story - brilliant, colors - vibrant, camerawork - creative, sound - unobtrusive, editing - slick, entire team - smart! Sorry, director saahab, I have run out of adjectives, so choose a superlative for yourself and I'll agree.What do I say? Where do I start? I must admit, it is the most difficult to write about a suspense thriller ""without giving the movie away"".  Any specifics that I would like to talk about will contribute to you knowing a bit about the movie. And that would be a crime in this genre. So, here is my attempt at being as unambiguous as possible.This movie will be talked about a lot for the stylish homage the director pays to the people/styles of movie-making that have inspired him. And for a good reason too. The beauty with which the tributes have been interwoven with the narrative is not something one should write or read about. It has to be watched and applauded. Watch out for the way the subtle tribute to Anand has blended with and become a part of the story.Acting - one of the departments missing from the list above - is not at its best. Dharmendra deserved far fewer lines considering his dialogue delivery was rather monotonous. Neil Nitin Mukesh is quite flat in some scenes, but overall, he has grasped and enacted the nuances of his character really well. For me, Vinay Pathak was the show stealer. In general, the versatility of this actor is just incredible!Dialogues - my disappointment with this area might have more to do with the expectations set by the first 15-20 minutes of the movie. The general mysterious tone set in the beginning is missing at certain points later on. Especially, in the climax, keeping the dialogue enigmatic would have had much more impact. But, I am sure it was a balance the director must have struggled with - leave it to the audience to decipher or spoon-feed them. What impressed me the most was how much I enjoyed the movie despite being a little dissatisfied with the two main departments of the movie - the two most visible ones. Though acting and dialogues are not necessarily the selling points of a movie in this genre. Just goes to show what a long way treatment of material can take a movie.]"
930,"[It's really exciting that new things are being tried. One obvious by-product of the process is that good directors, actors, music composers, lyricists are getting the visibility they deserve. Even if this particular movie is not necessarily the best cinema produced, it is just refreshing because of the subject matter chosen. Scripts revolving around women deserve brownie points anyway. Why? Because they are bound to be different considering there are such few made. This script, like many others, addresses the problems of the ""system"" that runs the country. The contemporary touch that it gives the context makes it a gripping watch. Unfortunately a great chance to have insightful dialogues is lost. And it's not like the silences are used well. Also, ultimately, it is a message movie. But, the message seems to be geared towards the media. How many takers are there for a message that specific?Also, there are digressions. One sub-plot used to establish the tone of the movie is too long. And another one, though necessary, is too rushed. Other minor digressions could have been entirely avoided (e.g., those alluding to characters' love lives). Also, there were a couple loose ends that either should have been entirely left out, or should have been given closure.Koena Puri and Swati Sen are brilliant actors and it would be a shame if they don't get such meaty characters to play in the future too. Swati shook me from within, in one of the scenes. The other actors are at best average. Most of them had monotonous, lifeless dialogue delivery.Though the music isn't extraordinary, the lyrics are awesome. And, the background score breaking into ""It's breaking news"" is a nag.Unfortunately, outstanding acting by the lead ladies will not be enough to cover the flaws in the details of the script. And this is despite an overall interesting plot. How I wish, it was marketed a little better, so at least a few more people would know about it.]"
931,"[So, it is a Yash Raj movie. You have learnt to forgive them for the extra tinge of orange and the sharp sounds, the mandatory songs and the unnecessary melodrama. But, if throughout the movie, the one question that nags you is, ""Could a real person, seriously react this way to this situation?"" then what exactly are you expected to enjoy? We are talking of a movie that claims to be about the 'journey of a woman'.  I refuse to believe that it was supposed to be in the leave-your-brain-home-and-don't-ask-too-many-questions genre. What could have been a celebration of the spirit of a woman, turns into another story of a woman finding ultimate happiness only in meeting an ideal man. It is uncanny how a salute to womanhood ends in men being the goal of their lives. Not to mention that men are shown as a breed who crave sex. So desperate are they that they pay huge sums to have sex with the most remorseful, uninterested women.Let alone the societal issues, the treatment given to the story was also half-hearted. The details were missing. Elements that needed build-up happened suddenly. The outcome of things that were built-up over the movie was resolved within 30 seconds of screen time.The only redeeming factors were the performances by the two leading ladies - Rani Mukherjee and Konkona Sen Sharma. We have seen both these women do a wide variety of roles, and these particular ones don't stand out from within the standards they have set for themselves. But, that they managed to jerk tears without adequate support from the script or the dialogues is praiseworthy. The dialogues, especially towards the end were so cliched that it was outright ridiculous. There was this one pause that Abhishek Bachchan takes mid-sentence. You could sense a huge portion of the audience admire their dialogue-predicting capabilities, when he finishes his line. The dialogues were excessive in a couple scenes given to Konkana. I think, left to her own devices, Konkana could have expressed much more with her silences.On the other hand, I was bowled over by the lyrics of the songs. Especially, ""nistabdh khadi hu mein"" and ""Kachi kaliyaa"". The music was refreshing because it was different. Now, whether or not the songs deserved time of their own on the screen is a different question altogether.The camerawork was average. No in-the-face camera or annoying movements except for a few scenes here and there. In fact, there were a couple of very well-done scenes depicting the emotional state of the character. Unfortunately, they did not go with the rest of the film because the technique did not continue in the rest of the movie. What amused me was the huge compliment the cameraperson paid to Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee in the song that was supposedly shot in Switzerland. Just imagine, they had all the scenic beauty in the world to capture and they focused mainly on close to mid-shots of the two-some. Or did they do that to avoid being criticized of favoring the Alps too much? Or could it be because it was not Switzerland at all? The rainbow shot towards the end of the song looked like use of blue screen. If it wasn't, then that's a bigger shame, isn't it? Imagine all that money spent and the effect is that of a blue screen.Better defined characters and even better defined motivations would have taken this overall interesting plot a long way. But, alas, that is a lot to ask for.]"
932,"[Having served as an Assistant Director for the original Malayalam film, Manichithrathazu (The Ornate Lock), starring Mohanlal, Shobhana, and Suresh Gopi, Priyadarshan has taken it upon himself to remake the film in Hindi as Bhool Bhulaiya.  The film has also been remade in Kannada and Telugu, and more famously in Tamil, with Rajnikant in the lead.Having unleashed a spate of shallow, loud, and situational gag oriented comedies, all of which were remakes of various Malayalam films, Bhool Bhulaiya requires Priyadarshan to tackle something that he had no need to engage with so far; namely a script that revolves around the psychological perturbation of one of the characters.  This perturbation causes certain effects, all of which we see in sequence as the film unspools.  The cause is revealed towards the end, and justifies the climax of the film.  All the major characters in the film are part of the ""Great Indian family""; so we have the karta and his sister, their respective spouses and children, and the nephew who has just returned from America with his new bride.  The only non 'family' character who is significant is the psychiatrist, played by Akshay Kumar. The director is unable to decide whether he would like the film to be a comedy or sound  a more serious note; the first half sees him trying to squeeze laughter from the audience by forcing the 'senior family' members to act like half wits, while the second half suddenly becomes somber and doom laden.  This necessitates a sudden change in the character of the psychiatrist, who until then is only too happy to ham it up loudly with the other members of the family.Unfortunately this sudden shift in mood leaves the viewer laughing at or at the very least contemplating this 'serious' part of the film, which includes the climax, with mild amusement.  The director is unable to create and sustain an ambience and a tempo that involves the viewer and has him or her empathizing with the collective ordeals of the family members, as well as that of the lead protagonist.From a slightly more abstract perspective, the film can be seen as a clash between western rationality and religious superstitition (as embodied in myths and a belief in the occult) and represented in the film as a clash between two generations: one steeped in rituals and esoteric practices and living in a 'Hindu small town', and the other, embodied through modern and western educated characters who hold 'professional' occupations.  This theme is further exemplified in the film through the character of the psychiatrist and his 'modern' psychology versus the mumbo jumbo of the religious priests.Towards the end of the film a change is shown happening to one of the characters.  This change could possibly be interpreted as an omnivorous female sexuality reasserting itself in the face of insipid patriarchal matrimony!!!!  This sexuality is subversive and threatening to the existing patriarchal order and hence the psychiatrist (male, of course) helps restore order and put things in their proper place.The cast has little to do in the film as they are playing out stereotypes; a fine actor like Shiney Ahuja is reduced to either bland acceptance or frothing rage, Amisha Patel weeps and moans throughout in a shrill voice, Vidya Balan is all sunshine and cheer, while Asrani, Paresh Rawal, and Manoj Joshi alternately rant and rave or are busy trying to look scared.  Akshay Kumar does his best, but the sudden shift in the script from the comic to the darkly tragic, pulls the stuffing out of his performance.  Vineeth  has been chosen for a non-consequential role, only for his terpsichorean prowess.  Rajpal Yadav is a total waste, not his fault, as his screen time runs to about five minutes or so. Sabu Cyril's art direction is adequate, though he overdoes his bit in the crowd scenes and peoples the frame with too many holy men.  The songs are a distraction and come in the way of the script seeking to build and maintain psychological tension.The climax is worthwhile, but unfortunately the emphasis on comedy in the earlier part of the film, completely ruins it.  The director could have reined himself in and set a bleak and ominous approach which would have made the film taut but does not do so, possibly because of the 'comic' expectations that the audience has of him.  One wonders whether one would ever get to see realistic cinema in mainstream Bollywood; even when the themes are realistic, the execution reduces them to crude buffoonery or a stylized gore fest.  One waits for the day.]"
933,"[There are a few ingredients in thrillers that are pretty much indispensable.  And ""Speed"" is missing those crucial elements. You need a main hero who oozes style. Sorry, two who don't ooze style won't do. Same goes for the villain. Then you need the one-liners - you might roll your eyes when they are said, but you have to agree a thriller is incomplete without them. And most importantly - an engaging plot! See, we know it's an average thriller, so we know the earth won't shatter into a zillion pieces. But, at least make a teeny-weeny attempt to engross us in your narrative.Again, out-of-this-world performances are not expected. Just enough to move the story along. And that, the not-so-stellar cast accomplishes. We could have done with a little less excited Zayed Khan, though. And why on earth was Aftab Shivdasani sporting the Mahendra Dhoni look? It is amazing how Aftab can wear the same expression, no matter who he is made to look like. I am not sure whether I can completely blame the actors for the lack of style. The lamest dialogues ever were fit into those two hours. How stylistically can you deliver lousy lines after all?The plot tries to strike a balance between two main threads, at least two mini-threads, 4 actors, and their ladies. That's a whole lot, and thus the loss of focus and mismanagement of pace is not really a surprise. I really didn't like the way the motivation of the villains unfolds for us. Too little, too late. What I did like though, are the action sequences saved for Zayed Khan. They are very-well choreographed and executed. The songs are dull too - lyrics, music, picturization, choreography, etc. Particularly bad is the one which is supposedly a love scene. People, decide - either be bold enough to show a couple actually making love, or skip it! You are fooling no one by using silly editing techniques to imply that the twosome is actually doing anything.Another director going from bad to worse. Another movie with actors continuing to do what they do in every other movie. Another story that needed at least another year's worth of work. Another few songs that the cine-goer could have survived without. Another wannabe entertainer released this Friday.]"
934,"[Update: The director has given his interpretation of the movie here. It is a very interesting read along with other interpretations here. Of course, these articles have spoilers. But, in my mind, it wouldn't matter much because even after reading these, you could come out with an interpretation of your own, if you go in with an open mind. Happy watching!A four-letter expletive repeated thrice is what I am left with. In an excited tone. In an ""I don't believe I just saw that in Hindi"" tone. And most fascinatingly in an ""It is beyond me to completely comprehend what I saw in one take"" tone. The beauty of abstract concepts is that there are almost as many meanings as there are viewers. What a paradox!? Something that is not obviously meaningful has many more meanings than a clear statement! Oh, did I just digress?Coming to the point - the movie was a treat for the senses. The background music, sound design, camerawork, special effects - all worked towards narrating the idea. Nope, I cannot make myself say I saw a story; it was a visual description of an idea - a 'what if...?' Such cinema might not be the proverbial ""everyone's cup of tea"". But, the point is, it is now available for those who enjoy a different flavor. Thank you, Mr. Director!John Abraham plays K and absolutely everything in the movie is from K's point of view. But, don't let that keep you away, even if you are wary of his acting skills. Because he is literally 'unbelievably' good. The transition from the self-obsessed, full-of-himself man to the person who has lost his grip was remarkable. Especially because this came through to us with his performance and not merely the lines given to him. However, we could have certainly survived without the animated thought bubbles. What exactly was their purpose? They were not funny, not insightful - especially since you could make out what John was thinking from his body language and movement of facial muscles (yes believe me, he can actually do that!).It was a joy to watch Paresh Rawal not making a fool of himself. But his performance lacked a punch that the character demanded. A more powerful, more menacing ""Sri Sri Sri ... baba"" would have been great.The dialogues are nice and crisp, and absent when not needed - leaving a lot of room for interpretation. At the very least a couple of metaphors to decipher. Especially, the commentary on the infinite self-improvement programmes resorted to these days. Do any of the umpteen movie awards given out have a bravery award? I guess not. I think the time has come to start one and the first one should go to 'No smoking'  Not just for the technical brilliance, but for the concept itself. Sadly, though, it might not go down as well with too many people. And those who are exposed to world cinema, have seen similar stuff before. But, what I admire is that I was able to watch it in a theater that screens mainstream Hindi movies and there were people who applauded when the credits started rolling.The question that I am still struggling with is - Would I have liked it as much if there were more obscure ideas translating into movies? Well, I'd say bring me more and we'll know!]"
935,"[Based on Marianne Pearl's book of the same name, A Mighty Heart focuses on the events surrounding the immediate aftermath of the kidnapping of Pearl's husband, fellow-journalist and Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl (played by Dan Futterman).When he went missing, Daniel was in Karachi - where most of the film is set - to investigate extremist links to British national Richard Reid, the infamous failed 'shoe bomber', jihadist and Guantanamo detainee. The film essentially documents the combined attempts of the Pakistani security forces, US intelligence services, Daniel's colleagues and Marianne herself to find Daniel and has captors.Marianne (played by Angelina Jolie) is unwilling to be a victim of circumstance: she is proactive, passionate and fiery as she attempts to unravel the tangled web of contacts, fixers and middlemen in the quest to locate her husband.Director Michael Winterbottom faces a challenge, which he deals with admirably: to combine both reconstruction and dramatisation. For the former, Winterbottom uses several techniques giving the film a 'fly on the wall' documentary quality, such as heavy use of handheld camera shots, along with datelines and interspersed contemporary news footage. For the latter, he keeps up the tempo through the editing - quick cuts between shots, jump cuts and pacy visuals. The combination of documentary style visuals and action thriller pacing is definitely in vogue right now - The Bourne Ultimatum stands as a prime example.Anurag Kashyap also had a crack with Black Friday, but A Mighty Heart succeeds where Black Friday ultimately failed. Whereas many of the sequences in Black Friday would have worked as dramatisations within a documentary, as a film it fell down because of the lack of genuine characterisation or cohesive narrative.A Mighty Heart manages to pull this off. This is definitely Marianne's story - not Daniel's - and we're firmly placed in her shoes throughout. Winterbottom resists the temptation either to dramatise or speculate about Daniel Pearl's incarceration itself. Following Daniel's disappearance, the emphasis is firmly on Marianne's desperate search, and we see him only in flashbacks or photographs. Just like Marianne, we have to learn the truth piece by piece as the story unfolds.As with Black Friday and Steven Spielberg's Munich, A Mighty Heart avoids over-simplistic cartoonish characterisations of the 'bad guys'. This adds to the realism; even jihadists have families too.Much has been said about Jolie's portrayal of Marianne. Is she the right actress for the part? To be fair, Jolie deserves credit for her performance. She puts in a strong emotional turn in an undoubtedly challenging role, and is certainly less irritating than usual. Without her influence (and that of her husband, co-producer Brad Pitt) it's unlikely that the film would have been made in the first place.Although Jolie is the star name, the film benefits from balanced and understated performances from across the cast. In particular, the ever-reliable Irrfan Khan is excellent as Captain, the Pakistani CID officer leading the investigation. Futterman has relatively little screen time, but convinces, as does Archie Panjabi as Marianne's friend and hostess Asra - who as an Indian in Pakistan faces problems of her own.Winterbottom occasionally lapses into cliche - is it possible to signify a new day in Pakistan without panning across a hazy dawn skyline accompanied by the cry of the muezzin? It seems not. As soon as we leave the haven of Asra's lavish Karachi bungalow we're pitched immediately into the apparent chaos of downtown Karachi. Yet while Karachi's traffic might seem threatening to many - and is presumably used as a device to unsettle the audience - it would not faze Daniel Pearl, an experienced journalist who lived and worked in Bombay.As an adaptation of a non-fiction book, A Mighty Heart may not have the luxury of a conventional plot. However, the film demonstrates that with care and attention to detail it is possible to produce an intelligent, thought-provoking dramatisation without resorting to sensationalist flourishes. Fittingly, like Marianne and Daniel, A Mighty Heart has dignity.]"
936,"[It's warm, it's cuddly, it's adorable, and it's telling the truth in the disclaimer at the beginning - it's fictional. Obviously, characters like Aditya Kashyap and Geet can exist only in imagination. But we are used to letting go of our need for ""resemblance to reality"". And once you do that you begin to identify with the emotions playing on the screen at that moment, even though the character as a whole is pretty unreal.Life is unambiguous when it is black and white. Everything is crystal clear. My problem with stories usually begins when people transition from black to white (or vice versa) without going through the gray. Here, it irritates, it nags, but soon enough the dialogues and the sheer charm of the actors playing the characters take you away from thinking too much about it. The dialogues have a very fresh feel to them. They are outright funny at times and quite perceptive at others. And they are hardly ever mundane (except the one given to Dara Singh!). What I found most interesting is that, whether comic or thoughtful, they were very believable. It must be some sort of an art form to actually make use of Kareena Kapoor's over-capacity to bubble and sparkle - it's very well woven into the story. I have always liked the way her eyes express her character's sorrow. But, in the movies I have watched so far, it is usually a glimpse, just a flicker. Here however, she retains the tone impressively for a longer time. It is also great to see Shaheed Kapoor get the chance to show his maturity as an actor. As cliched as the events might turn out to be, you don't want his character to be hurt.How can escapist cinema survive without its song and dance? We have plenty of foot-tapping numbers with fresh lyrics. The visualization of the songs was also done well. Especially, ""tumse hi"" - makes you really believe that the characters are in love.The length of the movie works against it. The average runtime of a movie in recent times is about two hours. There should be a very good reason for me to stay the extra 20-25 minutes, without fidgeting. And in this case, there was no spectacular cause to hold me. Tarun Arora's (Anshuman's) sequences were handled rather shabbily - almost as if they were intentionally ignored so that the audience does not empathize with him. They should have been cut down to bare minimum. And Dara Singh was absolutely, totally, completely avoidable - from all aspects - relevance to story, line(s) given to him, and the way he delivers them.While watching the movie, there were various points at which, I wanted the script to take an unexpected turn. A turn that would make it a little more substantial than just ""time-pass"". But, that was not to be. It's silly, it's mushy-mushy, it's not to be taken seriously at all - it's a perfect date movie. No more, no less.]"
937,"[Anyone who stays in a metropolis and is reasonably social will know people who remind them of each of the eight characters in the movie. But yet, neither do you identify with any of them nor do you feel good about/bad for any of them. Conclusion - the characters are reasonably well sketched out but the narrative doesn't engage you.Since the characters are regular people you aren't really expecting a never-imagined-before story. Four couples - four different types of love stories. Fair enough. Presumably each one represents a type of metropolitan relationship. But, does a story about regular people really make for an interesting movie? True, we crave for realism. But, it has to be insightful, leave a mark on your thought process. If a few laughs are what you want, you'll get those, but I don't think that is what the makers had in mind. They intended to make something more meaningful in a lighter vein, but light vein is all that we are left with.And there are a lot of inconsistencies. The funny lines make you laugh, thought not ""out loud"". And some supposedly funny situations don't do even that. The ""boss"" character was entirely avoidable. Introspective and/or emotional moments turn into lectures that you have imparted/listened to at some point in real life. And most likely, you used much better language. The writer has to be given due credit for inventing a new swear word though.The actors who deliver these lines aren't the best at their job either. The best of the lot, Manjari, is just about average in talent. Amruta is loud at most times, Neelam shouldn't have been given dialogues at all - certainly not English monologues. (Neelam's screen name is Xenobia and every time she came on screen the word ""Xenophobia"" kept popping into my head.) Anyway, none of the actors have the screen presence to make it work.The music could have been a little appealing had there been different tunes to different songs. Since almost all of them sounded the same, by the time you listen to the third song, you have reached the expiry date of the tune. The presentation is at best random. No sizzling dances to sweep you off your feet. Lyrics are by Sameer. Do I really need to say that they weren't interesting either? What was interesting though was the camerawork in one of the scenes. So, this is a movie about relationships, you have proposals and you have break-ups. Amidst all the ordinary camerawork, at one such break-up, you have the camera crew getting all creative on you. They take handheld camera shots as used in thrillers, thrilling background music et al. Technically, the entire scene looked completely out-of-place. Oh well. Mediocrity, thy name is Mumbai Salsa. Stories of our lives may seem interesting to us, but unfortunately they do not make watchable movies. So much for realism!]"
938,"[It is at best a very average variety entertainment program. You have mimicry, song, dance, skit - all woven to fit a theme. Isn't it sad that the biggest ""star"" of our industry is doing the mimicry and yet it is only mediocre? And get this. Half the time he only has to mimic the hamming, hawing, grinning and face-pulling of ... Shah Rukh Khan. No guys, my sense of humor hasn't taken a Diwali break. I am intelligent enough to realize the ""spoof"" genre requires you to make minimal use of intellect. I thoroughly enjoyed the ""spot-the-tribute"" game. I am sure I got most of the industry jokes. A few of them even had me in splits. And the coolest thing was that the people being made fun of couldn't be offended because the makers were equally vehement in making fun of themselves.But, it angered me when the movie shifted gears from paying homage to the 70s to actually becoming one of them. Because movies from the 70s certainly were not this blatantly arrogant. However lame, they did afford the audience a justification. No sirs and madam, ""anything"" doesn't go - sab kuchh nahi chalta hai! - Isn't that you wanted the citizens of this country to say Mr. Khan?The movie is reverse engineered. First came the idea of making a movie that took a dig at the movies that gave ""Bollywood"" its name. Then came the list of names/cliches/industry trends that had to be, with all humility, made fun of. Then came the individual gags. To be followed by the situations that could use those gags. This made the first half and suddenly realization dawned that the audience is not ""that"" stupid. They need a plot. So, let's throw in the first theme that comes to mind. And there you go, we have a movie. What we also have is this obvious rush to get from one joke to another and one event to another. The end product is choppy with very abrupt plot transitions. Now, you tell me, where's the time to fit in character development or chemistry between characters? Oh I forgot, spoof - no need for any such thing even if we did have time. Unfortunately, because of this excuse, I lose the golden opportunity of truly criticizing Shah Rukh Khan's acting capabilities. Spoof, right? One is supposed to overact. It is tragic that Kirron Kher also is annoyingly loud under the same pretext. So what, if in the same movie, Deepika Padukone, a debutante manages to get through with just the right expressions. And she looks drop-dead gorgeous.The good thing about having a woman director is that many women in the audience are kept happy with a very wet, bare-chested Shah Rukh for almost five minutes. A by-product of which is also a happy male, gay community. So what if the main woman lead is merely used to stun as a pretty prop?The best thing to come out of the movie is the lyrics. Especially the romantic numbers ""aankho meir teri"" and ""tumko paaya"". The picturization of ""tumko paaya"" is very adorable too. However, the choreography of the faster numbers seems like a medley of Farah's older sequences and thus has nothing new to offer. The one song that does not work is ""daastaan-e-om shanti om"". It does not have the edge, the zing, that ""ek hasina thi"" (Karz) it tried to spoof has.I think my most favorite sequence was the end credits. I love Farah Khan for giving credit where it is due. But, what does it say about the movie, if that is my favorite bit?These are no dimwits and they have a great sense of humor - Farah Khan, Shah Rukh Khan - basically the Khan family. Then, how could they take their audience so much for granted? Yes, we are in a festive mood, we are willing to lap up anything remotely happy. But, does that mean you shouldn't even attempt to sharpen the movie a bit? Each episode in the movie is a bit longer than necessary. Each cliche repeated a few more times than needed to keep it funny. Each exaggeration a little more melodramatic (imagine that!?) to make it annoying.The entire movie is a spoof. Then you have a spoof within a spoof. Then a spoof within a spoof within a spoof. So far, so good. You have learnt to excuse the joke driven situation (versus situation driven joke). Then...well, Farah Khan forgot where she had started and Shah Rukh Khan finished of the script for her. And we have this mess - moderately funny, but mess nevertheless.]"
939,"[This love story has nothing unique about it. The two protagonists are equally adorable characters, but want different things. Therefore, the audience is forced to take sides between two good people.  This is indeed a very interesting and novel concept for us as an audience. Also, the good thing about non-unique subjects is that it is easier for a larger audience to identify with the characters. But, unfortunately, whether it is the dialogues, or the theatrical acting, or the slow pace, or the direction, or a combination of all, I didn't get involved enough to care too much for either of the characters. Interestingly, I was more curious about Gulaabji's (Rani Mukherjee's) character. It could be because Rani played it really well and was the only one who got good lines.The other dialogues were outright tedious. Especially the monologues given to Ranbir Kapoor. Both the lines and he as an actor were trying too hard to charm. He seemed to be treading the thin line between being cute and coming across as mentally retarded. And even though he is really good at making use of his puppy eyes, Ranbir shouldn't have been asked to giggle or wriggle. He certainly shouldn't have been asked to dance behind a semi-transparent towel, with light thrown from the ""appropriate"" direction. I know-I know, elsewhere, I have appreciated female audience being taken care of appropriately, but a quarter-monty just for the sake of it? No, thank you! Sonam too had dull lines and her expressions looked like they were on a programmed loop - sad-smile-giggle-happy-glycerinated eyes-repeat. But the chemistry between her and Salman Khan was really good. She did look really dainty and with a touch-me-not quality. But, I would really have liked to see her with fewer layers of make-up. My guess is that she would look prettier. The one thing that I enjoyed a lot was the songs. Sameer's lyrics were only a shade better than his own average. But, the music was nice and soothing (except for the title track). There was something about the way the songs were recorded that made you take note of the singers. Kunal Ganjawala's voice gives the songs the required energy. The group choreography was fresh. But when Ranbir was alone on the screen things became really hilarious. He has this unique Dev Anand-meets-Raj Kapoor-meets-Shammi Kapoor-meets-Prabhu Deva potpourri dancing style which obviously ends up being weird. However, the use of colors and contrast, and the lighting were very different from the rest of the movie. All this put together made the songs an enchanting watch.Speaking of enchantment, we know that the only way Sanjay Leela Bhansali can make movies is when it has grand sets. It's a fetish; it's like choosing the best-looking font before starting work on a document. He knows they look artificial, so this once, he picked a subject that would give him the excuse to use grandeur. He made a fairy tale. Even if you keep this disclaimer in mind, there is nothing spectacular about the sets. The entire movie is shot just within one studio setting. To maintain the tone, the few long shots of this wonderland are animated (with a toy train running through it). But the beauty is captivating for about two seconds. A barely interesting subject combined with an unnecessarily slow pace makes the movie just-about watchable. The main characters are sweet, but do not have the muscle to pull it through.]"
940,"[The movie claims that all whites love to hate all browns. So, all browns hate all whites right back! First, the claim is not true. Don't tell me whites and browns don't befriend each other at all. Second, given that racism does exist, does it need any more fodder?Way too many characters have been inserted just for the sake of representing a stereotype, including the Bangladeshi who takes a beating or is ignored all the time. Merely perfunctory. The motivation behind each character's metamorphosis is just a supposedly powerful, however cliched, dialogue. Barring 2-3 funny lines, the rest are either lame, preachy, boring or all of the above. The story is a run-of-the-mill underdog story. No surprises there, the promos said it all. Also, as it says in so many words, it serves an ""us vs. them"" agenda, rather than a story of the underdogs. I am open to being aware of injustice done to people elsewhere, but I couldn't sympathize with the characters here. The screenplay consciously follows a pattern. Comic scene followed by emotional scene followed by a lighter one and repeat. The pattern doesn't have rhythm. They do not flow into each other, they chop into each other. Was there any editing at all? I mean other than that necessary to join one scene to the other? I can recall at least 3 scenes that only served the purpose of giving John Abraham more screen time. And a few such scenes for Boman Irani, and almost all of Bipasha Basu's scenes. John seems to have added to his range of expressions. I enjoyed his attitude in the first few scenes that had him. But later, it wore off. Boman was made to yell and overact on occasion. Anyways his character was not strong enough to make me care. Bipasha - well she had no character at all. Oops...that was not how I meant it to come out, but you know what I mean. A non-male is needed in a story for it to sell, so we spend on her make-up and clothes. Who has extra money or time to spend on her characterization, etc? Let's just make her giggle and smile it out.A sports movie has tremendous scope for the cameraman. Especially a game with fast movements, like football. But the opportunity is not utilized to the fullest. We get nothing spectacular. Not to mention that the football action scenes are unsuccessful at deception - it is all too plain that there were stunt doubles. And the non-football field scenes are shabbily shot. The music and lyrics are below average too. In fact, realizing that Javed Akhtar wrote, ""Hey dude, don't mess with me"" for a team that doesn't believe in itself is sad. However, Choreography of ""billo"" is nice. But, these are only means to an end. The movie wouldn't have worked, even if the various departments of movie making were handled well. Sports movies in India are generally made around invoking some kind of patriotism. I am not saying they should stop doing that. But, why would I care about some county league in England for goodness sake!? My patriotism is not nudged by the woes of ""browns"" settled abroad for their personal progress. Don't get me wrong, I most certainly have nothing against people migrating. In fact, there is no learning better than exposure to a different way of living. But, the immigrants choose to live there for a purpose and the positives do outweigh the negatives. A huge percentage of South Asians staying abroad will identify with the movie. And I don't have such a romantic view of the world that I would deny the existence of racism. But, the world portrayed here is the imagery that lives in closed minds. By the minds that enjoy nurturing the ""oooh-look-at-me-I-am-marginalised"" feeling. How many people from this population who are doing well in their lives complain about racism? How many of the people who are not doing well would do well if they were in their countries? Ironically, you see an ad featuring Shah Rukh Khan on a UK street - which means people who recognize him are a big enough and important mass.Is the aim to reduce the racism or to fan it further? Sports many-a-time borders on war in real life. Do we need movies to do that too?]"
941,"[I really like this trend of combining commercial cinema with believability. Where full advantage is taken of liberties given to the art form but yet no major leaps of faith are required. The one main thing the makers ask of you is a little benefit of doubt in character transformations towards the end. But by then you have enjoyed yourself enough to give it to them. It's a musical, so neither is great acting demanded nor is it delivered. Everybody has to do their bit without going over-the-top and that's what they stick to. It is very interesting and rather commendable that although Madhuri is the heart and soul of the movie, only once in a while do you realize that it is Madhuri you are watching and not Dia. The gripping script deserves as much credit as the woman herself. She is aging gracefully, and it's great that she is playing mother to a 10-12 year old and not posing as a college student. I am really glad they didn't work very hard on covering up the blemishes on her face. Makes her more earthly. Fortunately, the story is not just about her. And the movie is not just about her magical smile and wonderful eyes. Focus on just one character makes a movie very plain. Anyway, there is nothing very remarkable about her character.  Aaja Nachle is more a comment on the onslaught of commercialization. About how politicians and businessmen play together to achieve whatever fancies their whim. It is also an attempt to show how a new educated breed of politicians can use this power to make a difference if they will. And all of this is running in the background, so there is no preaching. All-in-all, pretty decent fare for a feel good movie. After a long while, a really long while, I was thinking, ""oh cool, it's not even interval yet"" instead of ""oh crap, it's not even interval yet."" The first half was very engrossing. And that the script was in the safe hands of Jaideep Sahni was a comforting thought during the interval. ""Even if it drops, it's not going to plummet to the bottom.""  And drop it does. The second half seemed rushed. The little nuances of characters that I admired in the beginning were all mish-mashed and lost by the end. But, the 20-minute grand finale in the form of a play makes up for all of that. What a spectacle! Yes, they don't let you forget you are watching a movie that has Yash Raj money pouring into it, and not a play. The edits, camera movements, art design all work towards that...and what a spectacle!! The lyrics, the music, the performances, the costumes, the colors, the choreography all make you wish that your eyes didn't need to blink. And that makes the extra half hour (over the standard two-hour length) acceptable. The audience in the theater was clapping after the play. It's almost as if the makers anticipated this and left a brilliantly timed pause at the end of the play.Is it only befitting that the who's who of the Indian ""parallel"" cinema is asked to sing and dance? Because the characters in the movie are also the most unlikely to dance. Who would have imagined Ranvir Shorey, Vinay Pathak, and Konkana Sen Sharma would all be part of a musical? Or is it just that the producer wanted to say, ""See, I made them dance too!"" I wonder.Is this becoming a formula at Yash Raj Films? One ""star"" whose name will pull in crowdsgood, relatively low profile actors to form the rest of the cast - who shouldn't mind/should have the exposurean above average, feel-good scriptdialogues that balance humor, charming believability, profundity Just an observation, not complaining...not yet.    ]"
942,"[I don't remember the last time someone's strong opinion was shoved so vehemently down my throat using a medium of mass communication. Maybe I was agitated because I have a strong opinion which is diametrically opposite to the one expressed in Gauri - the unborn.  But the point is that even if you were anti-abortion, I doubt you would enjoy it. Because it is badly made too.An otherwise fine actor, Atul Kulkarni, overacts. Rituparna Sengupta's dubbing was so bad and distracting, that it was difficult to focus on her performance. And close-ups of her awfully made-up face didn't help either. So, if you were inclined to shut your ears and eyes every time she's on screen, well...there's not much left. Baby Rushita has given a decent performance, but I can't help feeling bad for her. In this day and age, where parents mull over introducing adult topics to children at the right age, should a child even be allowed to play the spirit of an unborn child? Let alone lecture and emotionally blackmail adults who choose abortion. (I am not giving the movie away any more than the marketing department, because the movie posters say this in so many words).Given these factors, it matters little that the camerawork and background score are just about alright for a movie of this genre. On the other hand, the visual effects were pretty lame. Granted, it is a low budget movie, but then therein lies the creativity, right? To make a presentable product from the limited resources. The least they could do was give the child a lovable character so that the target audience would want to reconsider their decision on abortion. Especially when you are trying to convince people that abortion is evil. People of a nation most of whose problems can be narrowed down to the population explosion.]"
943,"[The end of the Cold War saw Hollywood and America launch a frantic search for bad guys, bad guys that could be over come and defeated by American heroes.  In the bargain, America, of course, would save the world and validate the truth of the American Way and the American Dream.In the Cold War it was the Russians, the Syrians / Arabs (check out True Lies) came next, and now it is the Al Qaeda and its free floating associates.The movie is set in Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom in the title, with very few scenes in the US of A.  Peter Berg is a director who seems to be very fond of hand held shots, and uses them liberally, with the result that camera shakes and actors sliding in and out of the frame becomes de rigueur in the film.  This effect works well in the action sequences, and also helps in building tension in parts of the film, but overall it is a bit too much for the viewer.   The script is predictable for the most part and has oft repeated themes in it.  The Saudi police men and the American FBI agent played by Jamie Foxx (an African American, a casting choice possibly influenced by the need to be politically correct) are shown as family men, the Americans and the Saudis initially distrust each other but then bonding takes place, cultural gaffes and clashes are shown as the Middle East and America come together, and so are palace intrigues in the Kingdom.  The Saudi police force comes across as professional, but rather hamstrung due to internal politics, while the Prince of the Kingdom sees every event as a photo opportunity.  On the American side, it portrays politicians as the ones who prevent good Americans from doing their jobs; all of which are themes as old as Adam himself.But it is the Americans obviously who know what to do and how to do it, and it is they who end up doing what it takes to promote justice.  The Saudi police are reduced to passive cooperators having accepted the superiority of the Americans.  This part of the film moves as a FBI procedural, where the American agents demonstrate their technical expertise to catch the bad guys.The last half an hour of the film explodes into action and the script remains predictable throughout right up to the end, but the action is well choreographed, the intensity evident, and the actors look as if they are really fighting for their lives.The last five minutes of the film are a surprise; one does not expect such a comment from a mainstream Hollywood action film.  But it is there, and this coupled with the decent acting and the last action set piece sequence lifts the film a notch above an average action thriller.]"
944,"[One of the main differentiating factors of short films is that they leave you with a punch line for closure. Now such lines do not necessarily work always. And that's the case with these 10 short films too.As the titles depict, Dus Kahaniyaan is a kaleidoscope of images, stories, narrative styles, issues. Almost all of the ten stories are about loss - loss of love or blind faith or friendship or life itself. Each story has a theme of its own and a thick vein of sexual desire runs through more than half of them. I thought that watching ten stories at one go was a little exhausting. It was like having to start, accelerate, reach a high, shut-off, and restart all over again every ten minutes. I also thought the order in which the movies were placed was interesting. By the third film or so you are anticipating the punch and by the seventh one you can pretty accurately guess the twist. I think fewer movies wouldn't have given the audience the chance to guess and would have left a better impact. (Yeah, they would have to change the title song a bit.)Not to mention that we wouldn't have missed a couple of them anyways (Lovedale and Sex on the Beach). While I wouldn't take away marks for the concepts being weird, they just didn't go well with the general tone of the collection. Then there were a couple that were preachy (Zahir, Gubbare, and Rice Plate). But while Zahir keeps you guessing till the very end, the other two were saved from being boring by some brilliant acting.The veteran actors show how it's done. Shabana Azmi, Naseeruddin Shah, and Nana Patekar make you forget their status in the industry and empathize with the characters they play. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the rest of the cast. While some of them are a little above average, the rest are barely mediocre. Be that as it may, every story got you involved and established characters really well within the 10 minutes assigned to it. I found the lighting and the camerawork pretty distracting in a couple stories. Matrimony had absolutely unnecessary usage of handheld camera and bright background lights. On the other hand, the same effects created the required mood for High on the Highway and Rise and Fall. I liked the narrative techniques of these last two as well. As a movie buff, you couldn't have asked for a better deal. 10-in-1. But, like any equipment that boasts of being ""so many""-in-one, this one too is a jack of a few trades and a master of none.Parental Guidance: Not only are the touched upon issues about adult relationships, there is a good amount of sexual content and quite a bit of violence.]"

946,"[The title, the promotional previews, and the other media publicity all give the impression that this movie is about Gandhi Jr., Harilal, and his struggle with being under the shadow of such a dynamic father.  But, at the end of it all, it comes across as a tool to sensitize the country to the fact that Gandhiji made many more sacrifices than meets the eye. Yet another movie from Gandhiji's point of view. The emotional trauma of Harilal, Baa and the rest of the family is side-lined. The experience feels incomplete.The movie starts out brilliantly. I was truly intrigued by the way we see Gandhiji as a father. You could see the human element instead of the usual demi-god status that this simple man is accorded. The parent-child problem felt so real because it was so much like any other parent-child problem - diverse expectations, disappointment in both directions, and the inevitable frustration. It really threw light on a totally different aspect of Gandhiji. Alas, the cookie crumbles. And the director could not maintain this tension past the first half hour. Soon enough, Gandhiji is put back on the pedestal. And the movie becomes a documentation of the history of our independence. A snippet of what Gandhiji was doing at that time, and another of what Harilal was doing at that time - literally alternating rhythmically. This also gives the movie a very choppy feel. Scenes just cut into each other under the guise of fade-ins and fade-outs rather than flowing with the narrative. It's the actors that make this worth a watch. You could feel Gandhiji's inclination towards his aspirations for the country while feeling responsibility towards his family. Darshan Jariwala has done great justice to portray the various shades of Gandhiji's personality - calm, preachy, upset, firm, ambitious, etc. I usually don't care for weak, loser-type characters in stories. But, Akshaye Khanna makes you feel for the nervous, diffident, eager-to-please Harilal who has a huge image to live up to. You can sense the pressure the son faces - wanting to impress his father but fortunately or unfortunately discovering that he has a mind and ambitions of his own. Shefali Shah, as usual, leaves you spell-bound. One look at her and you can imagine what Baa must have been going through at that time. Her make-up person needs special mention - each wrinkle seemed to have received minute attention. And I cannot forget Bhumika Chawla's expressions of frustration and helplessness, though she had very little time on the screen. I found the background settings extremely distracting. For a movie set in the early-mid 20th century, and for a not-so-bright subject matter, the colors seemed too bright and the objects in the background too new. These things took away from the drama that could have been created. Also, cliched use of rain to demonstrate pathos in the life of the characters was too in-the face. The solemn background music could not do much to retain the drama given the cheerful visuals. Of course, it could be argued that colors of our walls do not change according to whether we are happy or sad, but a freshly painted wall in the room of a person who doesn't have enough to feed his family, just doesn't gel. My main complaint though remains that we are not allowed entry into the minds of the characters. A huffy-puffy Harilal is not enough to convey his frustration. His motivations are never explained. Or for that matter, Gandhiji's justifications for his decisions were not clarified either. Even if we do give the benefit of doubt that such information might not be available, the question remains - why make a movie about relationships without knowing the rationale behind the characters' behavior? I set out to see what being a son to the father of our nation was like. I came out with glimpses of their relationship and a whole lot of unanswered questions. Fortunately, I also came out with some fine performances by the entire cast. Which is enough to keep the movie from being a complete disappointment.Update: David McDonald has left us a very interesting  comment in the notepad section  which clarifies a few of my issues with the movie. Please chip in with what you think and let the discussion continue.]"
947,"[I am the target audience for this movie. Like many Indians, (as appropriately depicted in the movie) I am a run-a-minute person. So, any game that claims to be ""exciting"" when the final score is 1-0, interests me only so much. Top it off with a ""Shah Rukh Khan is over-rated"" attitude. You know the makers have played their cards right, if a person with such tastes was hooked to the movie through its entire length. Though the credit mainly goes to the sharp and focused writing, the casting needs special mention too. But that will have to wait...This is Jaideep Sahni's movie all the way. The little unexpected things in the script make all the difference in an otherwise ordinary plot. In a movie about underdogs trying to achieve the impossible, you pretty much know where the story is going. It's the ""how"" you get there that counts and CHAKDE! INDIA scores (all pun intended!) at many levels. The obstacles that the characters encounter on the ride, and how they are overcome, keep you glued with enthusiasm till they reach their destination. And I am really glad they stuck to the hockey team and did not whine too much about the coach and his life.The rhythmic ups and downs in the story are supported equally well by the crisp, witty dialogues and the you-are-smart-viewers silences.  The sub-episodes flow from one into another without being episodic. That the editors did their job well is also demonstrated by this remark I overheard on my way out of the movie, ""The good thing about Hindi movies these days is that they are only two hours. 9.30 to 11.30 - nice movie"". The movie had actually started at 9. If a movie felt 20% shorter than it was, the editing department has done their job really well. Oh yeah, casting...the first thing you do to sell an ideology is to get a popular actor on board. But, they went one step further. The whole team is perfectly cast. From the hockey team to the hockey association members - not one of them can be singled out for not fitting into the shoes of the character.  It is difficult to say whether the dialogues were written first or the actors were chosen first. Okay - I loved Shah Rukh Khan's acting! There - I said it. Done.  (Believe me - It wasn't remotely as easy for me to write this as it is to read it.) The smirks were conspicuous by their absence; there was only an occasional, unnecessarily long-paused sentence; no romantic lines delivered in half-whispers (thank goodness!); and - get this - no trade-marked raising of hands on the side as if he is waiting for me to hug him. Best of all, he shared the space with the girls without overshadowing them. No-no, it's not only things that he did not do. There are things that he did right too. He was very controlled in emoting frustration, happiness, anger, disbelief. Actually all this made me excuse the occasional ""I am the King"" attitude (Ray Ban, et al)...ahem...okay...now before I get a divorce notice in the comment space here, let's wrap this up here.When the entire audience is rooting for a women's hockey team for 150 minutes straight, you know the movie has worked. The movie certainly achieved its aim of drawing attention to our national sport and especially to the plight of the women in this sport. It invoked the national spirit, made us whistle and cheer, clap hard, and laugh out loud. It was almost like we were in a stadium watching an actual game. The question, now, is - are we sensitized enough to do something about the situation? Meanwhile, like Shah Rukh's acting keep your expectations in control and enjoy the show.]"
948,"[Very rarely in Hindi cinema can you say - no significant story, not everybody has acted well, but still go watch it. Every frame (well almost!) is enchanting. And the going is slow, so you have enough time to take in every detail. Yes, the movie is a fairy tale and is narrated as such. Melodrama is used where a parent would use exaggerated voice modulation to narrate the story. But, I still wouldn't call it a children's movie. It is very unlikely that the hues, the pace, or the subtle sense of humor are going to retain a child's attention. On the other hand, it is a very short movie and what a perfect way this would be to introduce the art that cinema is to children! And yes parents, there is a moral at the end of the story.The camerawork, both indoors and outdoors, is simply breathtaking. Himachal Pradesh's tourism department could very well use scenes from here to advertise its scenic beauty. Though the interiors are largely shot in the dark, the lighting and colors are used to beautify the scenes to perfection. A few scenes are shot from the point of view of a character or an object, allowing you to see what they/it are seeing - here the camera in combination with the background score has been used to enhance the emotion sought to be created (read more in the ""what worked"" section).  There were a few frames that were outright ugly, almost felt like they were shot by a different camera crew altogether. But, after a while, I noticed that such shots were used specifically for the darker characters. Maybe it wasn't intentional, but if the viewer feels obligated to rationalize the things they don't like, the director has done his job well, right?The simple story is complemented by simple music which is soft on the ears. The lyrics very appropriately followed a child's train of thoughts. Reminded me a lot of Gulzar's own 'lakdi ki kaathi' from Masoom - a song that I grew up listening to. The lyrics especially stood out when the umbrella, an inanimate object, was being spoken of as a lover.What stuck out as a sore thumb was the acting by all the side characters. In fact, the little girl's performance was also not up to mark. It was lifeless and flat. Pankaj Kapoor however, made up for all of it with brilliant body language. And this movie is more about the artistic representation of the subject, more than any individual performance. Though, the movie is about the characters, it is not a character driven script. Here I go rationalizing again!This movie is as much a trip to fantasy land as it is an experiment with the medium through creative use of camera, lighting, music and color. A work of art that is very rarely made available to the common movie-going population. So, catch it while it is still in the theaters, because a DVD might not do full justice to the overall effort.]"
949,"[Did you know Marigold is the name of a flower? You did? Oh well, tough luck then - this movie is not for you, because that is about the most interesting thing you come out with. Yeah, it's that drab. If we were to plot a graph of the level of interest in the movie against the 100 odd minutes' run-time, the first hour or so would be pretty flat and close to the axis. By that time, when Prem's ever-smiley character shows an uncharacteristically different shade - you pretty much don't care which direction the graph is headed. Its exasperating when four stories try to unfold out of nowhere in the last 40 minutes. I was just relieved to leave the theater after the vertical drop in the last 10 minutes to run to the nearest available paracetamol. They should have done something to pep the script up, considering the acting was pretty much going to be flat or over the top. Oh right! Music was the supposed solution to this problem - a break in the monotony. In the director's own words, ""Music, of course, was the key part of the story of MARIGOLD"". Excuse me, director sahib - what story? Unfortunately, the music did not serve its purpose. Music from Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's other movies was used a lot as being played in pubs and rickshaws. These older numbers were much more entertaining than the originals for this one. One thing I was looking forward to, after watching the promotional trailers, was the visuals of the songs. Yep, flat there too!! One thing that was not dull though, was the animation used for transitions (they had an editor, you see). They were bright, colorful and well, extremely out-of-place and kitschy. There is some attempt at labeling Marigold as Hollywood's spoof on marriage with Bollywood, or something like that. Guys, let's fix first things first - let's try and make cinema first and then maybe we can talk about where it is from, and who can take digs on whom. Or were they, in the name of being Bollywood-like, just trying to give excuses for the innumerable problems in their own script? By the way, readers, I tried not to sound cliched and stereotypical by avoiding the following words - cliche, stereotypical, repetitive, yikes, eeeewww, Oh Gawd ... you get the general idea, right?]"

951,"[I marvel at how little time a story writer can spend on his characters. A 1-in-3 character will do (1 personality in 3 characters, duh!?) when there are shaking hips and comedy to take its place. Absolutely run-of-the-mill slapstick is in-charge of the first half of the movie. Interestingly though, the second half is taken over mostly by my kind of good subtle humor. And that's what made this one worth it for me. Who needs narratives when we have Akshay Kumar's 3-minute description of 3 characters, right? As Akshay's voiceover started annoying me, I let my mind wander around...(Sort-of random thought - Maybe slapstick was meant to be silent, you know - Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or even Mr. Bean - one element less to irritate me.)...people around me are whistling and hooting at every single barely-clad woman who comes on screen...(Random thought - I am touched! Not only the writer/director, but the audience too has immense respect for women.)...back to slapstick. Someone is reading my sort-of random thought. Words are replaced by a typical comedy feature - a fast forward action set to loud and pacy background music. No-no - I am not saying I wanted to see it at a slower pace (Gawd, NO!). Why does our new breed of directors need to resort to this cumbersome technique? Has all that needs to be explored in editing techniques been explored? I am sure there was a day and age when this was absolutely hilarious, but don't we need a little more than this to make us laugh? Maybe not. The full house (at an 8.45 AM show) was laughing its heart out. And they laughed again - the second time this technique was used in the span of 15 minutes...(More random thought - Whose fault is it that I am doing all this random thinking? Since I refuse to blame it on a human being, I blame it on the inimitable art of repetition.)...Oh wow! Barely-clad women gone!! Does Sajid Khan have a random-thought-reading contraption? Well, I know I do - exactly what I expect is happening on screen. And the few times the story is not predictable, they have left out explanations altogether. Anyway, cut to song...(Not-so random thought - There should be a better way of expressing, ""this child has changed my life"" than -'tune jeena sikhlaaya, tune mujhe insaan banaaya'(you've taught me how to live,you've made me into a human being)How about these two lines that a lay-person generated in 5 minutes... 'Nazar badli meri ya ye nazaare? Tere nazaare se badli hai dil ki niyatein'(Has the view changed or my vision? With you in view this heart has changed its intention))INTERVAL...Huh? Did they just start another movie by mistake? Where's the mandatory shouting gone? Suddenly, I have interesting and non-repetitive dialogues. Wow! Actual tongue-in-cheek humor, tangy one-liners!! Though the super-melodrama is here to stay, I am ecstatic that the movie is getting better and am laughing out really loud...(Not-at-all random thought - The more randomly I think, the better the movie gets. Maybe, it's my wandering mind that is making the movie improve. Or maybe I shouldn't start taking credit just yet)...oh, this is an interesting style of narration. Huge chunks of the story are narrated just by way of dialogue and finished off in five minutes. And huge chunks of time are taken to narrate the slow-moving parts of the story. Even-paced movies generally are better at retaining my attention, but interesting style nevertheless...(Back to random thought - Am I getting more responsive as Baby Johaina is getting more responsive? She is doing a good job of acting. Oh wait, no-one can make an 8-month old act. She is a natural!)...oops, what's wrong with Vidya Balan? Why is she so stiff, no body language? Where did she learn this non-acting? Hopefully, not from Fardeen Khan. On the other hand, Ritiesh Deshmukh is the regular amount of tolerable, and Akshay Kumar's comic timing is awesome in some of the scenes. But the star is Babyy Johaina - her expressions are the best...(Real random thought - When the universe was made how many more senses were generated. What were they? How were the current five (six?) chosen and why were the others discarded?)...yep, that's how uninteresting the climax is...This one would have been an absolute dud for me but for the comedy post-interval. THE END]"
952,"[You have an inkling of the director's self-indulgence as soon as you have heard of the title. And frame after frame you are just sitting there confirming that this man is just obsessed with himself, and of course his camera. Or the camera has possessed him. I was keen on sticking to a promise I made to myself a few months ago - control your urge to compare, and just enjoy the remake. But I was forced to give up when avoiding the parallels required way too much focus and started giving me a headache. Instead of narrating the story Ram Gopal Varma seemed to be solely concerned with changing the nitty-gritty of the original. You cut off hands, I think the story is better told if just fingers are chopped!?...You had a dialogue that is remembered 30 years later, I think a silence works better...You had a silence here, I think long-drawn dialogues over three scenes work better. Where's the creativity? Where's the much talked about interpretation?None of the characters are fleshed out. All come across as superficial and their motivations unclear. The actors are plainly regurgitating their utterly uninteresting dialogues. Most of the characters are dull and plain. Even Amitabh Bachchan is more Amitabh Bachchan than Babban (his character). In fact, Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prshant Raj) have almost identical characters except that they fall in love with different types of girls. It's sad when ""style"" is shown through use of the word in the lyrics instead of oozing out of the character.Oh wait! What am I talking about!? There is one strong character in the movie who wants to make sure you notice its personality - the camera. It is just all over the place, trying its best to steal the show. This behavior is getting progressively worse with every RGV product. And it is so even in the simplest of scenes. So, imagine what a treat they gave themselves in the action sequences. I hope the choreographer wasn't paid too much, because the camera was doing all the dancing. Amit Roy (cinematographer) must be such a tired person. He seriously needs a break - a long one. And he might as well take Amar Mohile with him, for he must be worn out cranking up the volume of his background score too. It also looks like there were huge date problems with the cast.  There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together (way too many over the shoulder shots and close-ups). This gives very little room for the chemistry, if any, between the characters to reach the audience. Okay, before I go on and on about the cameraman and the director...let's call it quits here (Huge hint to Ramu &amp; his factory workers!)Sholay? Nope, it is NOT Sholay. Sholay had detailed characters played by unforgettable actors, dialogues to die for, brilliant sense of humor, good music, a kick-ass background score, etc, etc, etc. Just shifting location from Ramgadh to Mumbai and festivals from ""Holi"" to ""Diwali"" with a full-of-life cameraman ain't going to help no one.]"
953,"[Dealing with an oft-repeated theme of the Hindu-Muslim situation in India without ruffling many feathers is a challenge in itself. Dhokha not only takes this challenge up, but also dresses it in a different background, and accessorizes it with a convincing back-story. And yet, it sticks to its mission of getting a message across.The script flows reasonably well. The 'ups and downs' that build towards the climax manage to retain the curiosity that is aroused in the first five minutes. Actually, that should be 'downs and downs' - yeah the theme at hand is dark and so is the story. The climax does feel a little rushed but again, given the sensitivity of the topic it is difficult to imagine any other way to end the movie. Unfortunately, a few plot points seem contrived. Also the movie gets border-line preachy every once in a while. And sermons equal boredom. Nevertheless there are a few thought-provoking philosophical one-liners that make the dialogues a little above average.It was exciting to watch the two main characters unfold and they were deftly kept consistent - which is a rarity in itself now-a-days. Muzzamil Ibrahim grasped the nuances of the character pretty well. His good looks and the perfect physique is going to set many a heart thumping. I am sure not many are going to mind the multiple number of showers he takes. Tulip Joshi does not have too many lines but performs wonderfully in the one scene of substance that she is given. That said, the side characters are absolutely underdeveloped and seemed really functional. In fact, Nandini played by Aushima Sawhney does not even have a fathomable function. What was Nandini doing in the story except showing off Aushima Sawhney's shoulders!? While walking out of the theater, I was wondering what is it that makes a gloomy subject a pleasant watch. It's not as if the performances were breathtakingly mesmerizing, or the screenplay was so taut that you didn't notice the sadness of it all. I think along with other positives mentioned above, it is the mature camerawork and lighting that added to the experience. It was also refreshing to hear some good lyrics set to decent tunes. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies that will go unnoticed by more than many. I hope it is not because people have lost their belief in cinema as a form of entertainment because of a catastrophe called Aag that hit our industry this week.]"
954,"[Consistency - that is what Dhamaal lacks. A few hold-my-stomach-and-laugh situations are sewn together with the regular loud, slapping-around slapstick. And in all of this, the story writers have been kind enough to worry about my well-being, literally begging my gray cells to take a break.Some of the gags were sadly derived from jokes that I first heard when I was ten, and have been deleting as e-mail forwards for the last ten years. On the other hand though, caricatures of some of the side-side-characters were outright hilarious and acted out really well too. You have to give them credit for creating an atmosphere of general interest throughout the movie. Within the first fifteen minutes you know that no matter what the lead characters plan, they are going to fall flat on their face (not literally, thank goodness!) But, it is the manner in which they fall that is pretty creative at most times. Unfortunately, the second half sees you playing catch-up with the five characters and what they are up to. The structure of the story itself becomes such that no amount of editing could create a flow in the narration.The performances were a mix of the good, the bad and the ugly too. Riteish Deshmukh and Javed Jaffrey added nuances to their characters with their comic timing. Sanjay Dutt and Ashish Chowdhary looked plain and disinterested. One doesn't expect any less from Asrani in a slapstick - the screaming is written off as soon as you know his name in the starcast. Here is the shocker - Arshad Warsi takes his cue from Asrani - how heart-breaking is that! Did anyone notice - no female lead! Ain't that great!? We all know how they could have easily been misused in a movie of this genre. No women also usually make the songs pretty much boring. The plain-as-ever lyrics and the lackluster music don't help. Not to mention the ridiculous choreography and the resultant indifference with which the cast executed it. What a waste of Javed Jaffrey! The background music did make certain situations funnier. But then, it got a bit much and annoying when it was used for every single movement of any character or object.There certainly are a few very good laughs packed in the two hours - about twenty minutes worth. But is that good enough to forgive the tolerable, miscellaneous comedy? On a lazy Sunday afternoon, on DVD with a remote control in hand - yes.]"
955,"[You know, how sometimes you walk into a movie, but carry a general dislike for one of the actors and are wary of having to watch him/her for the next couple hours. For the first time after a long-long time, I was wary while entering the theatre. Wary not of the actor, not so-much of the director, or the music director either. It was the anticipated giddying camera work that was making me anxious. Who was going to control him given the suspense-thriller genre? And I was not disappointed. Amit Roy does the trick again - of working really hard on what he thinks is cool. The problem is it does not look good at all. The background score too seems like there is a murder-a-minute waiting to happen. Now, instead of plagiarizing myself, I am going to have you read my complaints, which are the same for this movie, here. The whole team takes a good share of the blame, because ultimately the director calls the shots and directs the camerawork. Also, what the audience feels has a lot to do with the way the actors are shot. On the other hand, maybe, just maybe if the performances are strong enough they can rise above the other drawbacks. But, none of that happens.The entire cast does a reasonably mediocre job. Each one of them starts with one expression that suits their character and holds on to it for the rest of the movie. As I mentioned earlier, it is difficult to judge the performances. The extra-dull dialogues didn't help either. The movie was called Darling because Geeta (Esha Deol) wanted to call Aaditya (Fardeen Khan) ""Darling"" sarcastically every ten mintues. Or may be it was the other way round. The script was far from satisfactory too. If the script does not move forward, how can the actors be expected to change their expressions, you see. Also, I can't remember another movie in which songs seemed more forced in. Even the item numbers at the beginning and the end seemed to be there to keep people happy. Like a promise to be kept with Nisha Kothari. Or like Isha Koppikar's excessively-clad character needed some breathing space, so ""here do an item number, and throw that character-defining sari away"". Oh and the crooning, ""oooo-oooo-tadap-tadap"" sounded so familiar, just can't remember which other movie had a similar tune...it's at the tip of my tongue... Yeah-yeah, I am good at subtle sarcasm.So, a suspense thriller which makes you laugh instead of making you clench your nails into the seat. A camera that does all the moving on behalf of the plot. I am not left with many insults to fling at the whole team.]"
956,"[Kaushik Roy's Apna Asmaan is a film that stands out from the other releases so far this year. It is a touching, simple film that communicates the personal pains and feelings of an autistic child's parents. A brilliant film stands out for a perfect blend of all the technicalities of cinema. If any one aspect is bolder than the rest, then we tend to refer to the film as well shot, or well edited or good story etc, etc. Apna Asmaan in totality is a film that is complete in itself. Communicating through cinema has never been so complete. That is why it is so unique, and has stood out. Most popular cinema takes it as a given that the audience is not a thinking population and comes to sit back and talk on the cell phone or eat popcorn, coffee etc. They often insult the viewers mind or stick to the theatrical performances of Shahrukh Khans.This film however, has transcended this problem. The director has shown maturity and full understanding of the viewers. At no point of the film does it tend to go off into ridiculous overacting. In fact, given the storyline and lines, Irfan and Shobhana have done a wonderful job. Good direction and the right choice of actors have made the film so perfect. The script and story are married with all fine points taken care of. However what struck me in due course of the film was the inability of the director to break from the stereotypical image of the woman as a mother and wife. New age cinema in India should attempt to break such stereotypes; otherwise the same would circulate in the subconscious minds of the viewers. It is known and well researched that films have a strong influence on the society at large. In such a case only sensitive filmmakers can come forward to break certain myths where women are concerned. There seems to be a subtle hint about the modern intelligent woman and her aspirations for her family and herself in this movie. There is a negative image that evolves, that does not promote women to step beyond home and family.Otherwise Apna Asmaan is a brilliant film worth watching and remembering. Kaushik Roy, though an ex-adman and first-time movie director, has brought out a theme so real and close to life without adding too much of unnecessary excesses of regular Hindi commercial cinema.]"
957,"[Though it might not be a break from the regular ""little story-dance-comic relief-repeat"" routine, this story is told with an atypical backdrop. Of course, Rajasthan has been covered beautifully umpteen times earlier. It's the slightly unusual ""little story"", the justifiable ""dance"", and the restrained ""comic relief"" that make it different. Although different isn't always good, this time around it is. The mature treatment given to a kids' movie is good enough for me to give it a few extra brownie points. Samir Karnik should certainly start acting classes for children. The performance that he has extracted from debutant Dwij Yadav is one of the best I have seen from a child artist in a long time. Unfortunately, that can't be said of the adults. Fortunately though, the adults don't have too much screen time (yes Bobby Deol too! Now will you go and watch the movie?). And none of them, graciously enough, tried to over-shadow Dwij. It is his movie and the whole team let it be that way.The structure of the story is pretty conventional. Problems are presented in the first half, and their resolutions are sought out post-interval. The pacing was rather interesting - but ultimately a drawback. The problems are presented so subtly and slowly in the first half that you feel nothing has happened so far. As the last hour begins, you wonder how they are going to wrap everything up in such little time. Of course, they do bring a closure to everything, and have to understandably do it quickly. My issue is that the first half was interesting, and the second half sort-of dull. I blame it largely on the avoidable, although endurable, preachy set-up. One could claim that it was the need of the story, but it became boring. The few long shots of the town of Jaisalmer are beautiful, but seem repetitive. The lighting in the night shots of the lake is exquisite and achieves the romanticism it intends to. The close-ups however seem artificial. Watch out for the clever editing used to cover up Bobby Deol's dancing non-skills. And this is despite the relatively simple choreography employed. Music for the title song and ""Kesariya"" is shockingly unlike this music director. It might be similar to others' music, but not this one. And before you can recover from the shock, you are back to trade-mark Himesh Reshamiya crooning in ""Lamha Lamha"", ""Akhiya akhiya"", and ""ulfat ulfat"". Given the repetitive use of repetition, need I say more about the lyrics? Or maybe it's just Himesh's musical requirement.Never mind. Ultimately this is an adorable movie made out of an equally lovable kids' story. The endearing bit is that it does not sport the ""what do kids know?"" attitude. Of course, this is once you are done laughing at the fact that Bobby Deol is being presented as the best star that Bombay has produced. Soon enough, you begin admiring him for taking up this unusual project.]"
958,"[""dhik-chak--dhik-chak-dhum-dhum"". What a warm welcome! That's the background score using all its extra energy. Well-accompanied with well-endowed cleavage. No - there isn't any connection. That's just what stares you in the face at the word go. The interesting editing used in the beginning to establish the characters makes you ignore the loud score - at least for a bit. Unfortunately though, the story is pretty much predictable and thus becomes a chore to watch.Everything seems half-baked or in some cases completely uncooked. Shreyas Talpade looks good but seemed a bit off playing the mature character. Then again, that might have been very intentional. Udita Goswami plays a character who is constantly under duress and underdressed. So can't really blame her for the singular expression she wears through most of the movie. Tusshar Kapoor - can't blame him either. He was miscast. Look at him! Obsessed lover? Doesn't work at all!As in most cases, the script is the deal breaker here. It is neither coherent, nor researched, and has got it all wrong as far as plot points is concerned. ""slish-slash-whiplash"". The background score is still at it. And so is the flesh show. Towards the end, your head is spinning. One would think I am trying to blame the music, but I am not. It's the multiple supposed ""twists"" that get annoyingly weary on my one-kilo brain. So much so that you begin suspecting the very premise of the whole plot.I completely understand that the film-makers believe that the genre required loud music. I am glad though that they didn't think so about camerawork. That and the slick editing put together made some parts really interesting, visually. Especially during the titles and a couple songs. While the music is just about alright, the lyrics of ""ke bin tere"" are nice.""tak-tada-tak-bluck-bluck"". They just won't let go...till the last shot. I admit it is a bit unfair to pick on just the background score, when almost every other department needed a lot more work and re-work.]"
959,"[I have never been a fan of animation films; somehow I find them ""squeaky"" in terms of the animation and the sound, and I have so far judiciously avoided them.  A friend of mine insisted that we go for this movie, and so off we went, me with a mild sense of unease, but determined to endure the movie stoically.However, the film turned out to be more than a pleasant surprise; it was about something that I absolutely adore - food.  The last film I saw on food was Chocolat, which used food as a metaphor for sexuality, freedom, and community, and starred Johnny Depp and Juliet Binoche.Ratatouille is the name of a rustic French dish made from eggplant, onions, and zucchini, and the film uses the dish as a symbol to send out a clarion call to return to a more romantic age, when maternal love, tenderness, and affection were what made a tasty dish, rather than sophisticated culinary skills.  The film then expands this point by stating that food and cooking needs to be democratized and demystified as expressed in Gusteau's (the Master Chef in the film) motto: ""Anybody can Cook!""Food, and the process of its preparation, is seen as an everyday, easily accessible method for realizing the creative potential inherent in all humans.  The struggle that Remy (the lead character who is a rat) faces to become a chef symbolizes his creative aspirations, and underlines the point that one's class and caste do not necessarily limit what one can become.  Mastery of the mystery of food is the badge that allows Remy to move beyond his social background.In turn Remy is considered a weirdo by his fellows for his interest in cooking food, rather than just scavenging on whatever is available.  The film also takes potshots at frozen foods and fast foods, and the current fascination with them, primarily due to notions of ""convenience"" and ""time and money saving"".Being a Disney film, the rats are made to look as anthropomorphic and cute as possible. But for the viewer, the concept of food cooked by rats being delicious and better than human cooked food may be a bit too much for the palate. (Remember the rats in the kitchen, uggh!)  Food for human beings is fundamentally concerned with purity; food is pure when it is cooked by members of our own social group and becomes impure and disgusting when it is cooked by the Other (people who do not belong to our social group.)  The rats then embody this Otherness, which is very difficult to digest! (Pun after bad pun!)Cooking food is also represented as an unconscious process, a process that does not really involve conscious thought, but something else that combines intuition, sensory delight, discipline, and a celebration of life and romance; it is something that you have, not something that necessarily can be acquired.If you are a food lover, watch this film. If you are not, do still watch it.  This film is a succulent dish with a light spicy flavour!  Bon Appetit!  And remember to take the family along - after all what is food without family!]"
960,"[This is yet another summer movie, but one that purports to be even better and bigger in terms of special effects or CGI as they call it these days!  (Aren't they all!)?Directed by Michael Bay, he of the big budget, louder than ever, a crash a second movie genre, Transformers is trite, banal, and hackneyed.  Based on a set of toys made by Hasbro and which were popular around twenty years ago in the US of A (aren't there better sources of inspiration around?), Transformers is all about machines, machines, and more machines.  The movie is a wet dream for technology freaks and for those who dream of absolute power through technological domination.  We have lovingly shot sequences of planes, tanks, and guns, all black and glistening, hard and throbbing, and filled with deadly intent.  We have shots of alien robots, which are amazingly anthropomorphic, (how come, if they are machine intelligences from an alien planet) right down to their lubricating fluid outlets (did you get that one?) metamorphosing themselves into sleek transport machines - trailer trucks, a Ford Camarro, a fighter jet and other unnamables, lest viewers get bored even for a second.  And to make up the rest of the film, we have action scenes involving robots and men, robots versus robots, and robots running amok in the deserts of Qatar destroying good old American military technology.Yes, there are a few humans scattered in the film, but they are largely inconsequential.  We have the nerdy Sam Witwicky, who has something that the alien robots want and which is hidden in a top-secret location, and we have the obligatory local female hot bod Mikaela Banes, and we have Sam's parents, and of course, his pet Chihuahua.  We have Jon Voight playing the Secretary of Defence, (in what must be the lousiest role of his career) substituting for a shadow President.What we do not get is a reasonable plot, character development, and a rationale for all the destruction we see on the screen.  The film is tedium personified and all the special effects by Industrial Light and Magic cannot save it, as I just could not relate to any of the characters.Yes, the humans end up saving the world and setting things right, but none of it was of any interest to me, as I have seen it all before.  The camera jerks amazingly in the action sequences, as if the cinematographer was trying to convey an out of the body hallucinogenic experience to the viewer.The sub text is all about America and American technology saving the world, the automobile as a pumped up phallic symbol which would set women drooling and leave men free to do what they really want, which is to have sex with attractive women.  To complete the picture, we have the embodiment of the techno freak fantasy of humans coexisting peacefully with technology that they themselves have created, but which has become so complex and mystifying, that now it is totally alien. The movie cost something around 150 million dollars, so the word goes, and one wonders whether a larger fraction could have been invested in a bound shooting script and getting hold of real actors!   The audience for the film is assumed to have an IQ slightly smaller than their shoe size, well, so I guess that does not really matter.  The pre pubescent crowd might enjoy the film given that there a few jokes about the masturbatory habits of young, pheromone oozing males, and a scene where Mikaela drapes herself on Sam's automobile hood, inspects the engine, and makes appreciative noises about pumps, heads, and power!!]"
961,"[Each character sketch is a stereotype. Each dialogue is sharp and smart and works towards setting the stereotype deeper into the mould. Not a word wasted. Each member of the cast playing their role to the tee. And yet, there was something amiss. I can make a long list of things that I did like. But two hours later I am still unable to articulate exactly what it is that didn't make it an instant hit.It is not a ""laugh-my-heart-out"" type of comedy. But it did have those satirical elements that kept a smile on my face for the entire duration. All characters are very close to real-life; enough to be freely available for each one of us to encounter at some point or the other in our lives. Each one of course, is exaggerated a tinge to underline the sarcasm. Jabs are taken at many social double standards. It is the type of humor I enjoy, the subtle, tongue-in-cheek types.  But yet, it felt incomplete. The overall idea is pretty cool. What more could we as viewers want? A reality show, which is done in less than 90 minutes instead of 19 weeks. No safety circles or unnecessary tension filled eliminations! However, the details of the story seem off - a little too flat. There are no particular ups and downs. But, then again, who ever said that every story needs an arch? Also, how many ups and downs do our lives go through over a weekend? So, in that simplistic sense the story is not bad either, but it leaves something wanting. There are finer details that seem unrealistic in this otherwise authentic setting. I must say though, that it has one of the most amusing anti-climatic climax.Acting, by one and all, is absolutely outstanding. No one can be better when veteran Shabana Azmi is in the cast list. But, Manish Acharya himself (he is also the director) does a marvelous job of playing a nerd - being self-absorbed yet conscious of being a misfit, the coy boy who has no clue how to deal with women. Technically what stood out was the minimal use of background music and camera movement. Like many things in life, it is what you don't do that makes things better. Realistic characters, realistic setting, but yet a story that is not completely believable. All-in-all, it is more of a ""relaxed Sunday afternoon at home"" movie than a ""rush to the theater this instant"" one.]"
962,"[Either I am super-dumb and don't understand how things work in life, or the moviemakers have no concept of how real people behave. For obvious reasons, I am leaning towards the latter interpretation. There are way too many questions that crop up and remain unanswered. Why does Ishwar (Amtiabh Bachchan) behave a certain way for 27 years and then make a 180 degree turnaround in behavior at the most inappropriate juncture in his son's life? Why is Aadi (Akshay Kumar) such a nondescript loser despite being portrayed as smart and educated?  Why are we being asked to feel sorry for this loser? While I am at it, why is Akshay Kumar made out to be a 27 year old?If a movie is about relationships, shouldn't it, at the very least, have consistent characters involved in those relationships?  And this one should have been easier, right? It is about just one relationship, so only two characters need to be well-defined.Why anyone should try and excel at the art of making Amitabh Bachchan overact, is beyond me. I weep silently when I see the 'master of comic timing' run around trying to hit someone in an attempt to make me laugh. Director's actor and all is fine, but didn't he feel one-bit silly while saying the lamest lines ever? What did I do to deserve this? Oh sorry, this isn't about me, is it? Okay, time to snap out of ""questions"" mode.Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav as comic relief serve their purpose. They relieve you from the drudgery of bad-scripting that forms the main plot. But, the same type of joke is repeated once too often and you want relief from the jokes then. The overall plot is not a bad premise for a movie at all. But the way the details in the script have been handled is outright shabby. E.g., it is amazing that no one on the crew has ever seen how a pregnant woman is treated or behaves. No, pregnant women are not patients. They should live an active lifestyle. But, it's silly when you dance and sway around in air at one point and are not allowed to do a single household chore in the next.The redeeming factor is that you feel like slapping Aadi into reality, which means Akshay Kumar has done his job well. Of course, the assumption being that his character is meant to irritate you. And tears jerked every once in a while for a sensitively handled scene here and there. Nonetheless, in a futile attempt to please crowds, a decent story has been slaughtered with soap opera-ish situations, ridiculously placed songs, and jokes played out in skit format. And such imprudence shall not be forgiven.Alrighty then, I am off for a week-long holiday. Yep! Vacationing meetu = no review this Friday. Until next week then, hasta-la-vista...]"
963,"[Don't let the video of the promotional song put you off. This is a brave directorial debut and most certainly not cheesily picturized. I am willing to take a bet that the said video was made by a completely different set of people - marketing MBAs in all likelihood. People, who for some reason think bright colors and half-naked women is the only thing that can get us to the theater. Originality executed even reasonably well is so hard to come by, that if you spot one from a mile, it deserves enthusiastic support. The freshness lies in the way the vaguely familiar stories are sewn together. The clever dialogues giving company all along. The way the complex plot unfolds and transitions from one sub-plot to another without once taxing the brains of the viewer is enticing. Sitting on the edge of the seat gives me a backache, otherwise that is what I would be doing through most of it. And just when you feel, ""okay, one more sub-plot might make this whole thing go over-board"", the movie ends. The writer had the balance just right. So, bonus marks just for the guts it takes to do something like this. Of course, a perfect product is hard to come by too. So there are a few things amiss. The one that strikes the most is the lead pair's performance. They are not completely off, but don't have the whole range either - be it expressions, body language, voice modulation. And that nags through to the end. The supporting cast though, barring the shrieking vamp, gives creditworthy support. I also had issues with the unnecessarily tilted camera angle which was over-used to the verge of nausea in the first half. Throughout the movie though, there were these little things that kept me in splits. Sound effects used to exaggerate the going-ons took the cake. Creative slapstick is welcome, especially if the dosage is really low. Similarly, the background music absolutely complemented the pace of the movie. Particularly, the car chases where Pulp-Fiction-inspired strings play - an apt tribute. In fact, a lot of the ""style"" looks like it is inspired/derived from Pulp Fiction. The creativity with which some of the humor was infused in the story was brilliant. Alas, there is a largish measure of dark comedy that neither provoked nor tickled. It existed and thus it was watched.  Thus, the comedy that works, works really well but is appalling when it's crude. Interestingly, the pace was very much like riding on a Mumbai local train. Takes off slowly, gathers momentum, goes to top speed and stays there till the destination arrives where it slows down for a short while before the credits start rolling. If the symbolism was intentional, I thoroughly enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek humor. But, was it worth the risk - having a thriller start off and land at a sluggish pace? A good 10 minutes out of the first half hour and another 5 minutes of the last 15-20 minutes could have been edited out. If the symbolism is a fabrication of my imagination - oh well, I deserve points for coming up with the analogy! ]"
964,"[Last night while watching Shootout at Lokhandwala (SAL) I was beaming with joy, gloating in a pool of pride and all this not because I am proud of Apoorva Lakhia's directorial skills but because I was spot on with my prediction. Yes people, Shootout at Lokhandwala is a complete bukwass philum. I really feel sorry for all those who expected this gangster rap to be rocking, but yaar if you mix 5 star class pasta with roadside vada paav you would only end up with beswadi khichadi.And that's exactly what SAL is, neither a classy commercial film nor a gut-retching reality flick. All you do the entire 2 hours 15 minutes is wait for this torture to get over because you can't even afford to walk off after shelling out 250 Rupees behind this miserable effort.But not to worry too much, if you have already bought the tickets and have yet to see it, here are some noteworthy aspects (and thank God for that).Sanjay Dutt and his sexy slouchy walk - Man, the way he walks is simply mind-blowing. Not at all exaggerating here but this old-dude can put even the most happening male model on the ramp to shame. It's no surprise as to why he is fondly nicknamed Deadly Dutt.Amrita Singh as Maya Dolas' mother - Now without makeup she does look a little freaky but her blended performance of a psychopath and emotional mother is quite believable. In my opinion she has done a much better job than most of her male co-actors.National Anthem - In Mumbai multiplexes its mandatory to stand and listen to our National Anthem before the start of any film, and as far as I can re-collect this was the only enjoyable 3 minutes at a stretch from last night's show.Now moving on to my bitchy side, here are just some of points (and a few advices) that make this film a thakela watch.Tusshar Kapoor and Ronit Roy seem to be very much influenced by Ekta Kapoor's saas-bahu serials, their chest hair seem to appear and disappear as conveniently as the characters in K-serials.What the heck is wrong with Suniel Shetty's accent? The man should realize that he can't carry it off as stylishly as apna Sallu baba.A total waste of Bindass Babe Rakhi Sawant. She should have infact been given more screen time than those duds like Dia Mirza and Neha Dhupia.So much money but still such kanjoos Mr. Sanjay Gupta is that he could not even arrange for decent body double for Abhishek Bachchan and the Dubai Don.Over dosage of Item Songs.Vivek...Vivek...Vivek, oh boy! I feel so sad for you. No jokes I really do and as a well-wisher I advise you to move on, move on from your tango with Mrs. Rai Bachchan and from acting in Bollywood.Sanjay Gupta desperately needs to change his production house's name from White Feathers to Black Feathers, maybe with the insertion of Black he could finally get rid-off the bad voodoo and start making watchable movies.Apoorva Lakhia, no offenses but you seem to have gone from bad to worse with every film of yours. Its time you realize this ain't your thing, how about joining Balaji Telefilms?As you can see from the above, I could go on and on and on but I won't.Instead I shall leave you with the most apt one-liner exhaled by some dude, once the credit titles were up - ""Gupta, Kya F***all Picture Hai"".]"
965,"[Cheeni Kum comes across as the perfect recipe for the weekend.  Great performances, great dialogues, hilarious situations, well-defined characters, great visuals...the ingredients are all there.R Balki (Balkrishnan), the debutant director, has done a commendable job, and not since Farhan Akhtar's Dil Chahta Hai has a first directorial venture come out so impressively. Like Farhan in DCH, Balki has done the story himself and has come up with well-etched out characters. The characterization has been done so well that even cameos like the chef's crew or medical store-owner impress.The performances of Amitabh and Tabu are of the highest quality, though Tabu impresses a little more than Big B, and her screen persona at times reminds you of Shabana Azmi. Both lead actors impress with their comical timing (non-slapstick) and their Urdu diction is always spot-on - I wish the irritating journalists of 'Aaj Tak' could speak Urdu like this.The movie also marks the return of music maestro Illaiyaraja, and he has done a tidy job. The mellifluous ""Jane do na"" number by Shreya Ghoshal has a lilting effect. Singer Vijay Prakash has done Amitabh's playback wonderfully well - thank god there is no Sudesh Bhonsle for a change!Editing by Chandan Arora is slick and glitch-free.  PC Sreeram's Cinematography is impressive, and he has captured the locales of both London and Delhi beautifully. The dialogues of Cheeni Kum clearly take the cake, with the sarcastic repartee every now and then being the flavour of the movie.Remember Ayesha kapoor? The girl who bagged all the awards for her role in Black. Well, she is not there in the movie, but she might have been one of Balki's inspirations while writing the movie (more on this in the notepad section).The movie is primarily a comedy, but it is neither devoid of a story, nor is it a palliative for the neurons. And what's more, it has a message too, which the young at heart would surely love. Vis-a-vis other movies of its ilk, Cheeni Kum comfortably scores over Jogger's Park (though JP had richer &amp; varied music) and Nishabd. Amitabh's role is cleanly developed and thankfully there are no traces of the gaucherie of Sexy Sam.All in all, Cheeni Kum is a movie that should certainly be watched. The movie has one or two small sequences (though comical), which may warrant parental discretion, so decide for yourselves if you would like to take your kids along. Happy viewing!]"
966,"[I wonder which college Shaad Ali went to...either he has studied abroad, or he hasn't made it to a college at all! Because had he gone to a conventional desi college, he would certainly have known how to play the game of 'spin a yarn' effectively.Shaad has disappointed by not encashing the opportunity that the mighty Yash Raj banner presented to him. Patchy storyline, lackadaisical screenplay and an overdose of theatrics have completely killed the movie. Add to that the not so great music score from Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, and you have a half-baked, mediocre chitrahaar called Jhoom Barabar Jhoom.The saving grace in the movie comes from Aki Narula, the Costume designer and Abhishek Bachchan the actor (in that order). The costume donned by Big B is quite impressive, as is the distinct look given to Abhishek; though I wonder if Amitabh would have done this role had his son not been there in the movie. Lara Dutta gives a steady performance, but Zinta babe and Deol puttar are clearly below par.A word on Abhishek's performance: he has shown remarkable comic timing and doesn't look wooden anymore in facial expression or dance movements. His look has been well worked at and it is sad that poor direction and a poorer story would deny him the adulations that he would otherwise have received.Ayananka Bose, the Cinematographer has done a steady job, but then you simply can't opt for the movie because of its Cinematography. Of late, there has been a plethora of movies showing Western locales (KANK, Ta Ra Rum Pum, Cheeni Kum) and therefore there isn't any novelty left in the way foreign locales are picturized. So never mind the Eiffel Tower or the Waterloo station or indeed our pride Taj Mahal, you would not miss much if you give this movie a skip.Shaad Ali's fetish for the Taj though leaves a stale taste in the mouth...apart from the 'Taj for Sale' sequence in Bunty aur Babli (where present-day UP's CM Mayawati was lampooned as Phoolsakhiji), he had picturized the 'Chup Chupke-2, chori se chori' song using Taj as backdrop. In JBJ too, a reasonably long (and therefore irritating) sequence is picturized, using portions of the song 'Bol Na halke halke' as well.Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have largely disappointed, and barring the title track and the mellifluous 'Bol Na halke halke' (rendered by Rahat Fateh Ali &amp; Mahalaxmi Iyer), the tracks sound monotonous and jarring.The Editing by Ritesh Soni is just about OK, and barring the climax, isn't too great. Vaibhavi Merchant's Choreography also fetches her pass marks, and that is rather disappointing because the scope for her was tremendous. She has given repetitive steps to Abhishek, which was avoidable. Worse still, she has made a good dancer (Bobby Deol) look average. I wonder if this was done deliberately at behest of the now powerful Bachchans, just like Big B was made to look the weak dancer in K3G's 'Shaava Shaava' by Farah Khan as the behest of Shah Rukh Khan. In a nutshell, Jhoom Barabar Jhoom is a David Dhawan type of movie and should be watched only if you endorse the 'dimaag nikaal ke dekho' school of thought. Since the promos of the movie are a few leap years ahead of the full-length stuff, I suggest that you shouldn't strain your time and money on this flick and instead be happy with the promo.]"
967,"[There are no pretensions here of making this a profound message movie to please all ages. It is very clearly meant for kids below ten and doesn't lose focus. In fact, they bank heavily upon the supposedly limited movie watching experience of these children. This is evident through the very expected turn of events - from the micro sub-sub-plots to the ultimate climax. It's the sweet understated instances that keep the wire live though. Fantasy tales fascinate me immensely. We leave the whole world open for the storyteller to explore. He can take us anywhere he wishes with no obligation to stick to reality. It is entirely up to him to use the leverage that we so liberally give him.  Yet Jay (story writer) has very admirably tried his best to remain rooted to the ground. The side effect though is that the basic plot is pretty much unimaginative and thus has no surprises. The restraint shows in all other departments too. The camerawork very appropriately doesn't take you dizzying through MTV land. Which also means the editor is not behaving as if he has these new toys called 'scissors' and 'sticky tape'. Sorry guys, forgive me, I have still not overcome the shock called Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. Visually, Chain Kulii Ki Main Kulii equals a soothing boat ride on a calm lake while Jhoom Barabar Jhoom equals a rocky car ride on the potholed monsoon roads of Pune (India). Okay - digression ends here. Rahul Bose is his usual calm and composed self too. The kids behave like kids except for the one or two times that they get all philosophical and reflective on the adults. Patently unnatural. And the other dialogues are too natural and thus basically boring. The music is actually infuriating. Especially ""Sunday Sunday"" which is a blatant copy of ""Na bole tum na maine kuch kaha"" of Baton Baton Mein.However, I did quite enjoy the spoof cricket world created. They had it all - the mandatory Sardar (Sikh), the left-handed captain star-batsman, the Muslim pace bowler, the number 10 T-shirt, a coach that experiments with the batting line-up, and last but not the least - a chauvinistic dig at the female commentator who ""obviously"" knows nothing about the game. So, plan of action for the weekend - take the kids to the theater while you stay out looking for some other form of entertainment to alternate between loo and fag breaks. And at the end of it all, together you can say, ""What fun!?""]"
968,"[I want to be an actor too - I have more than one and a half facial expressions. Oh, but will that mean I have to be a nasal singer and crack a poor joke about myself on the big screen? The good thing though, is that I would need to be a music director with just one tune in my head. Lyricists who can change the words around a bit here and there must be readily available. No, never mind, I can't, I don't wear a cap that a houseful theater would hoot and whistle at. Too predictable of one to talk about Himesh's cap, well if he can have a badly timed joke about it, why can't I?Okay, I exaggerated on the music bit. Himesh has certainly tried at least one tune (""Dil na todna"") a little out of his usual style, but listening to it you wish he hadn't. The camerawork and lighting of the first song ""assalaam vaalekum"" is beautiful. But then things deteriorate. Song-after-song-after-song (thank me for not doing that 5 more times). On the way he forgets pronunciation - have never heard ""bina"" and ""tanhaiyaan"" being crooned out so badly. And to top it off, we have the sacrilege called ""Mehbooba mehbooba"". Were they actually given permission to do this to a song from Sholay? Dear Mr. Burman, I apologize for listening to this version of arguably one of your best compositions. And while am it, Mohammad Rafiji, I am sorry for laughing out loud at what was done to ""dard-e-dil"" of Karz.Having totally trashed the two main attractions of the movie - the lack of acting by Himesh Reshammiya and then the music - I must tell you something about myself. I am a very patient person as far as movies are concerned. It is usually very difficult for a movie to bore me. Even after about half an hour post interval, I was hopeful. Hopeful that at least the story will be an actual thriller. Alas, the completely lose it thereafter! Far from causing any sort of a thrill, some bits were slow - allowing enough unintended giggle-time - and thus bored till hair be torn apart. The last half hour was plain, outright, superbly ridiculous!! Who gave them a right to take us so much for granted?!There are no well rounded characters for me to really complain about character inconsistency. Anyone can do anything or nothing. Most characters can transform from evil to good without the slightest provocation and with most inane dialogues for support. And when there are such glaring gaps I don't really have the right to talk about details like a person changing his cap after being arrested.Ah yes, how can I not mention the quintessential ""oomph"" factor - Ms. Sherawat. She does her bit. Flaunts her body, dances a couple of dances, utters the mandatory line or two, because she is a character in the plot after all. And Ms. Motwani, well, she looks sweet and has so much eye-shadow on, that she can barely open her eyes. Oh yeah, and what is with the lipstick for Sachin Khedekar and the bright orange lip gloss for Pankaj Jha?What can I say when the most interesting part of the two+ hours spent in the theater was the 30 second teaser of ""Sultan The Warrior"" (actually looking forward to it!)?]"
969,"[Drum roll And this year's ""Most dedicated to the profession"" award goes to.....meetu. drum doesn't know when to stop rolling. Just like the people involved in the movie did not know when to stop rolling the camera - well, they shouldn't even have started.

So now, you read.No-no, I wouldn't claim the award for sitting through the whole movie. That I have immense capacity for - call me a masochist. I deserve it because not only do I have the gall to let the world know that I watched this, I am also spending another few hours writing about it. I deserve something special in return!! Okay, I give my humble self a break. Hopefully my time and energy has earned some respect and you will skip the movie.Calling this movie slapstick is an offense. Do pee-gases-poop-jokes really make even slapstick-lovers laugh? Are falling people, water fights, mistaken identities so amusing that you can make an entire movie out of it? By they way, did anyone even consider real dialogues versus what the actors seem to have come up with from their own stand-up acts? How I longed for a single song - however bad, however inappropriately placed! Especially if it would have meant taking some screen time from the 15-minute-long people-hiding-in-closets-sequence and another 15-minute passing-the-treasure-game. We would be fools to expect a story when it took them 45 minutes to just introduce the dozen and a half ""characters"". Vijay Raaz was the only actor who made an attempt at a performance. The rest were just basking in their own glory of over-acting, oblivious to the world who wanted their ears, their hair, their brains intact. Of late, in general, even an overall bad movie has good camerawork, editing, sound design. Not here! Close-ups are so close that at least one character has his face chopped off - lower-lip and downward. I noticed at least two cuts mid-sentence when Raju Srivastav was speaking to the camera for some reason or the other. The characters were yelling at the top of their voices for me to be able to even notice the other noises.Don't worry guys, I realize I haven't been absolutely selfless here. I watched the movie because I have to. I told the world that I watched it because I wanted the award. I wrote this review in such length because one needs an outlet for one's frustration.]"
970,"[As a movie buff I would watch this movie just for the creative concept. Unfortunately, however, it does not get support from any of the other departments. Also, it's a shame that while the overall plot is imaginative, way too many individual scenes are so cliched that you can say what's going to happen next with your eyes, ears and brains shut. As any thriller should, the movie moves at a remarkably fast pace and before you know it you are watching the interval previews. And thus no time is wasted on character development, detailing or consistency. Also the actors playing these characters don't help the cause. Barring Akshaye Khanna, the rest of the ensemble either drone to make you sleep or shriek to wake you up. And it isn't Akshaye's best performance either. Part of the credit for lousy acting and characterization should also go to the ridiculous dialogues.They seemed to have had a hard time trying to decide whether this should have been a comedy or a suspense thriller. I am willing to take a bet that it would have been a much better product if they had chosen one and just stuck by it. Mixing the two has done irreparable damage to it. Especially since the thrilling twists and turns, very unintentionally, make you laugh and the juvenile comedy makes you grit your teeth in anger. And the back and forth manipulations in the second half become a tad too exhausting for the viewer. The saving grace is that the director of photography, the editor, and the sound designer have shown considerable restraint. Given the locales and the subject of the movie it was very easy to go overboard in these departments.On the other hand, I seem to have run out of ways to complain about Sameer's lyrics. And is it original music by Pritam this time? That could explain why it is worse than mediocre. What I find most amazing about any work of art is the passion with which the artist creates it. In a movie it is more exciting because there are so many passionate people involved. But it is most unfortunate when almost everythinglooks like a half-hearted attempt. What a waste of a clever idea because nobody felt the need to pay attention to the details!]"
971,"[An open mind helps. I laughed out loud a few times in the first half - playing along, humoring the makers, taking silliness at face value, generally taking a chill pill. Really, otherwise I wouldn't have ""liked"" the movie even this much. But, the jokes took a sudden dip in the second half and the last half hour literally wore me out. I will make my peace with being labeled a stuck-up. I don't care much for the David Dhawan style of escapism and I certainly don't think we were missing much while Govinda was away pulling faces in the parliament. So, obviously, by transitivity I am certainly not big on the David Dhawan-Govinda combination. (Ok, no need to get all geeky on me and bring up the nitty-gritty of the theory.) The point is that if you fall in any of the above categories, you are at the wrong place.Having offended 64% of the Hindi cinema-goers, I must reassure the rest of you that I am in no way trying to infuse any intellect into a David Dhawan presentation. Lest my intellect be questioned. Still searching my heart and soul desperately - looking for something more than a few jokes to like the movie.Unfortunately, I am also not into Salman Khan, his biceps (or his jokes on showing them off), or his very intentional melodramatic dialogue delivery. Oh well...might as well go ahead and say that Katrina Kaif looks more and more like a plastic doll with heavy make-up on. The good thing is the director was smart enough not to give her too many lines. Oops! I just lost another 34 (31 + 3)% of the Hindi cinema goers. Lara Dutta on the other hand, is looking prettier by the day. And somehow that has also improved her acting. When ideas are copied from some other movies, obviously making a frame-by-frame copy adds no creative value. But, when you see the additions made to Andy Tennant's Hitch in Partner you begin to rethink your unwarranted and utterly ridiculous demands for creativity. When there were no songs for the first 20 odd minutes, I thought I had dozed off at some point and missed a whole load of fun. Though I must say that they were making up for it with the extra background score and loudly delivered lines. And when calamities come they come in battalions. I was shown song after song with music that you could tap your feet to but was missing the extra something that makes a song memorable. And well, the lyrics lack soul. But, the good thing about Salman and Govinda is that they never disappoint as dancers. Though I could have survived even without their pelvises being thrust here, there and everywhere (sitting in second row from screen did not help!). But, then can't really complain, can I? It is a David Dhawan movie, after all. I must admit that this is more than the regular slapstick that has people chasing people and throwing stuff at each other. There is the regular slapstick (Govinda with pants down, et al) + a missile chasing Salman in a scuba suit (Oh come on girls, wipe that drool!!) + a choTa Don with the Don theme music in the background + etc. Sounds like fun to you? Go for it!  May be the last 2% of us should form a self-help group so we can begin to understand the rest of our race.]"
972,"[Half an hour into the movie, I was amazed at how well I knew the dozen-odd characters. This was achieved by characters saying and doing things in a small sub-plot. Pretty impressive, that they didn't go the mundane voiceover route. Unfortunately though, most of the characters continue doing the same thing for the next hour and a half too. Movies like this exist neither to shock nor entertain nor thrill nor to provide relief from the daily grind. They are made just because someone thought more people should hear this story.  Almost all the characters are gray and they exist just for you to know them - not for you to judge or feel for. Since the going was slow, I had a lot of time to pay attention to things other than the ""object"" of the camera, and what he/she is saying/doing. Especially, since they did not have anything new to say/do after a while. The background stood out. The narrative is set up in a crowded set of buildings - Bow Barracks. There is constant but changing noise (children playing, people cooking, etc) in the background which adds flavor to the scene. The messy rooms reflected the personalities of the occupants. Though it does raise a question in my organization-crazy mind - did none of them really care for any sort of orderliness?! Oh well...I also enjoyed the picturization of the songs. The style was similar in all songs - shots of the singer singing, interspersed with the happenings at Bow Barracks. It was engaging, nevertheless, mainly because the singer was different every time and brought his/her style and nuances to the screen. The camera purposefully moves, in a style different from the way the rest of the movie is picturized, to give it the slightest video album touch. Unfortunately, the screenplay and the dialogues make this a drag to watch. Thirty minutes shorter and the movie would improve on both counts, because inevitably all the repetitive lines would have to see the door. So, if you are the kind for whom something needs to happen every minute, and the movie has to have an absolute definable purpose - please don't bother. But for those of you, who can ignore the flaws and focus on the characters - wait for the movie to be out on DVD and rent it when you are in a not-so-light mood. Parental warning! Loads of profanity and sexual content. Moderate violence.]"
973,"[Routine problems, marital tiffs are resolved magically using random mantraaa,and long discourses delivered by a neighbor, a colleague or a rickshaw-walaaa.Brainless chicks and men who have crassness for wit deliver without a commaaa,lines that seem like they have been written by a spot boy with the production-fellaaa.Screaming - the only way they were taught to act at the school of overacting and melodramaaa,Rama Rama Kya Hai Dramaaa.Middle-of-frame objects, close-ups - surely there are other ways to use the cameraaa.And, where's the rhythm, where's the flow?

974,"[Watching Mithya is like watching a cricket match that started out well but ended up being one-sided after all. Anything can happen at lunch break. But in the second innings, there is no fight, no struggle to keep your attention and thus you end up with a very cold climax. And the cold-blooded murders don't have anything to do with this cold. It is more like the ""I couldn't care less"" cold. The subtle comedy in the first half is an integral part of the plot - from a comment on ""anything free is better"" attitude, to the hints at the eating habits of people in the film industry. Barring a lone toilet joke, the interdependency between the lines and the situation brings a flow to the plot. The humor along with the art direction, the background score, the performances, etc. create an environment conducive to suspension of disbelief. And disbelief you can live with. Only to see the movie being rushed from one episode to the other keeping a 120 minute time-limit in mind. Genre shifts or mixing too many genres generally bother me. But, the finger cannot be pointed towards that either. It moves from dark comedy to plain dark. That's not that much of a shift. But its disconcerting to see the humor dry up along the way. I would blame the writing for the downfall - the dialogues are not witty or funny any more, the sub-plots not that well streamlined. And it lacked the punch, the mind-bending twist that a movie of this genre needs.Giving credit where it's due though, only the likes of Rajat Kapoor could cast Ranveer Shorey as the main lead. It takes guts to have Naseeruddin Shah play second fiddle. And he certainly has made an attempt to show the many layers of VK/Raj's (Ranveer Shorey) character. Now, whether he was successful in getting them across to the audience is an altogether different issue. An awesome opportunity to portray the VK's mental process is lost.The first half-second half split in writing has taken its toll on the performances too. A promising start has everybody doing their bit and getting a cackle out of you with their comic timing. And suddenly, the acting too becomes very superficial as the movie approaches the climax.On the other hand, I thoroughly enjoyed the background score throughout the movie. At times however, especially in the beginning, it overpowered the volume of the dialogues and thus I might have missed a few good dialogues. But overall, it was refreshing accompaniment.A second half that flowed better would have made Mithya a must watch with its tongue-in-cheek humor. The anti-climatic climax leaves you feeling high and dry. All this hoopla for what? The most common way to get to a oft-repeated noir climax?]"
975,"[I am not exactly a fan of qualified opinions - especially with opinion on movies. Either you like it or you don't - no if, no but, only ""mut"" (opinion in Hindi). In a 5-star scale, Jodhaa Akbar certainly deserves 3, but that would translate to ""Wait for DVD release"" here. And what a waste it would be to have you do that with such a beautifully shot movie. However, after spending half of the 200+ minutes on mostly mundane romance and the other half on interesting yet dissatisfying display of politics, I cannot tell you it is a must watch. Either catch it in theaters or skip it completely. Meanwhile, suggestions for a descriptive rating to go between the second-last and middle rating are welcome!Jodhaa Akbar can be clearly divided into two parts - the political saga and the romance between the royal couple. It is also obvious that the romance is the prime focus of the narrative. Hrithik Roshan (Emperor Akbar) who is chiseled to fit the handsomest mould and picture-perfect, Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan (Queen Jodhaa) are wonderful in their scenes together. You get your dose of Chemistry along with History and Geography. But, I would say that it is largely due to the time given for that chemistry to develop - for the curiosity to become respect to become love. And here we hit the circular argument; the time taken is the biggest culprit. The movie is unjustifiably long.In these often heavily cliched romantic scenes, the law of diminishing returns kept cropping into my mind. In any movie in general, every extra minute beyond the 120-minute mark yields lesser enjoyment than the previous one. Unless, unless ... you have an extremely captivating story to tell, or you are telling it in an extremely captivating manner. I need something more than glittery jewelry and costumes, bright reds, oranges, and yellows, and fantabulous sets to keep me from fidgeting. Something more natural, something less made-up. And get this, here the interval is at 120 minutes!The romance is pretty dull. From the bedroom tiffs to the mistaken identities - nothing is new or handled in a creative way. Especially appalling is the way the mother of all misunderstandings takes shape - a speech delivered in the most monotonous fashion by Ms. Rai-Bachchan. The sole scene that might stand out is the sword fight between the two. All-in-all this romance lacked Bhuvan-Gauri's innocent charm or Mohan Bhargav-Geeta's elegance.On the other hand, the political drama, including the dialogues, was extremely interesting, - even though most of it is a voiceover delivering a lesson in history. All credit to the history teacher, Amitabh Bachchan - listen to how the voice softens when it talks about Jodhaa. Some of the political situations are executed really well too. The reactions of various Rajputs to Akbar's orders is a fine example. Another highlight of political dramas is the language used. Both Urdu and Hindi are used beautifully, especially in the political sequences. At times the same dialogue was repeated once in each language. It sounded like an enchanting jugalbandi of the languages.Unfortunately though, these are treated as mere sub-plots to give a break to the mushy-mushy happenings in the main story. Most of the side characters are underdeveloped and thus one-dimensional. It seems like the director is simply fulfilling his duty by filling us in on the political environment. To watch Akbar become a crowd-pleaser with just one act of kindness is unconvincing. If this one action is supposed to be symbolic of all such actions he must have taken, then it is extremely dissatisfying. More instances of Jodhaa being the light that guides Akbar's soul would not have harmed. And of course, lack of time cannot be an excuse now, can it?The war and action scenes are an integral part of the entire drama. While other battle sequences are rather repetitive, the first one has some exquisite camera work and background score. Some of the fast camera movements have an awesome 3-D effect (okay, almost!). The silences add to the drama as much as the drum rolls.The Rahman-Gowariker duo usually churns out some wonderful music. And if nothing else they are a spectacle. But, here I felt let down. Only towards the end of ""Khwaja"" did I realize that all through the song they were trying to build Akbar's character. To show how he can be mesmerized and go into a trance. Till then, all I could do was empathize with the giggles around me looking at mannequins wearing clay-pot-look-alike hats and attempting a puppet dance. ""Azeem-o-shaan"" is brilliant more because of the crowd and the aerial shots rather than the choreography and use of color. We've had much better from both A. R. Rehman's musical sensibilities and Javed Akhtar's pen and imagination. Mr. Gowariker, how about leaving the melodrama, the ""almighty solving all problems without any input from humans"" syndrome to the Barjatyas? How about letting Ekta Kapoor reign the ""salt-pepper"" kitchen politics? So, we can block that out of our systems just by name. Surely there must have been more to the saas-bahu equation than that! Cannot thank you enough for sparing us the triple action repeat cuts, though. A thousand salutations to N D Studios, magnificent sets! But how about leaving that to the Bhansalis of the world? What's the point if you can't focus on what you do best - narrate a story, reach out to us?]"
976,"[Simplicity always feels good. Maybe because it is earthly or maybe because the very essence is lack of exaggeration. Valu's charming simplicity, however, in combination with its repetitiveness makes it a good watch but only for the very patient. The most endearing part about Valu is its characters. And these characters add up to create the atmosphere of a village in the interiors of Maharashtra. The language has a strong dash of an every-day sense of humor. The rawness of the dialect adds to the overall appeal. But this could also keep it from being accessible to a larger audience. Unfortunately, the language that defines the characters shows only one facet of their personality and thus end up giving a one-dimensional feel to each character. And make them not-so-interesting once you get to know them. However, I cannot take away from the fact that each and every actor has played their role in an utmost convincing manner, making you laugh and understand the one point they are trying to make. Right from the politician's sidekicks to the middle-class government worker (Atul Kulkarni) - each one enjoyable in his/her own right. The screenplay takes its own sweet time in establishing these characters. And it has all the time in the world because there is no great story to narrate here. The baseline story is as one-line as it can get. The villagers want to get rid of a bull that has become a menace. But there are layers if you are interested in peeling them. Underlying the superficial ""nothing happening"" feel of the screenplay are a couple of strong themes.Something about the way this one line is narrated makes you think about human nature. Is every human just trying to find some excuse to blame for his/her misfortune? ""Is the bull really a menace?"" Nothing about its behavior on screen justifies the behavior of some of the villagers. There are three people in the village who don't want the bull to go. Why are they the only ones who are seemingly content with their existence?Is the bull a metaphor for any argument concerning society - abortion, affirmative action? There are pros and there are cons. Or is the one-liner yet another representation of the mother of all metaphors - The system! Is the bull a metaphor for everything that deviates from normal behavior in the ""system""? Most people want to be rid of it, while a handful doesn't mind the co-existence. As you can see, I am not very good with metaphors. All I know is the director is trying to say a little more than the obvious. And I think that's the inherent beauty of metaphorical work. It's open to interpretation.Oh well, let's come back to what can be seen. The camera breathtakingly captures the curves of the rugged terrain. And in tandem, the actors are given a curving trajectory that gives the frames a captivating beauty. This is especially true in the scenes where the bull is being chased.Yet, all this put together, Valu is only adorable and not necessarily a must watch for everyone. For people who can enjoy the language, maybe. But otherwise, without ""really good"" subtitles it might end up being quite tedious.]"
977,"[What is the aim of life? To find happiness. What makes one happy? Money / fame / power / other smaller things in life. What happens once you've experienced that? You are satisfied temporarily and then magically find something else that could make you happier.Repeat. This aspect of human nature is explored in Oh, My God!!. The character and situation chosen are exaggerated and thus seem unrealistic in a very bizarre way. And the surreal style of narration in turn brings the metaphors in focus.Vinay Pathak, the ambitious, common man whose hopes are all attached to a multi-level marketing scheme, not only makes you empathize but also makes you identify with his character. You gradually see yourself replacing his desires with yours, even if you are scoffing at his 'scheme'. Yet, romance is one area where he seems like a misfit. Divya Dutta, his screen-wife didn't look comfortable either. Though, as an individual performer she made her small problems very real. The one-line story - a man aspires for financial growth and when he actually finds himself in the money, he's not satisfied - sounds very immature, even child-like. But when you realize that this 'aim of life' is actually only symbolic, the experience gets meatier. You could actually replace 'need for money' with anything else and the result would be the same. When you achieve it, you'd complain about the manner in which you got it. If you are okay with that, you'll lose your sleep or even sanity in trying to protect it. And this is true not only for the loftier desires. Even for a person who is happy with the little things in life, the satisfaction of one little need is only replaced with another little need. And these issues are not over-dramatized, they are just brought in as the story progresses. The dialogues start out very fresh but become preachy lines, albeit masked, by the end. Yet the events in the last half hour seem like a to-do list - a hurried culmination of what was taking its time to develop. Also, something has gone grossly wrong if a 90-minute movie seems like a drag in parts. The grainy texture (low-budget induced?) and the lack of straight-regular camera angles increased the amount of patience required while watching the movie. The continuous use of a bottom-up/top-down/wide-angle were only distracting. It's always exciting to see on screen what others make of their lives and especially attempt the heavy, ""what are we here for?"" question. And when you have someone like Vinay Pathak to take you through it, it's a pleasure. Yet, the narrative seems incomplete and the quick speech as a farewell note doesn't help either.]"
978,"[The sun shines on the city's landmarks and makes them look even prettier. And you know you are in a YRF movie. Albeit this time, you see the ruggedness of the city too. You also are in awe of the restraint. 15-20 minutes and no mention of a foreign location. Another 5 minutes and the background music is still in the background. Wow! 10 more minutes and you might just want to pinch yourself because Shah Rukh Khan hasn't yet done that annoying thing with his eyebrow and lips. And...the spell breaks. Bring on the accordion, the loud chatter, the self-referencing, and all. We were missing you. There are only three two-and-a-half characters here, Surendra, his wife Tani and his friend Bobby. Yes, the back-story is barebones or even less. This leaves room for the crux of the relationship. ""L-O-V-E"". And here it thankfully goes a couple of layers deep. It takes you into the world of this twosome that got married without really knowing each other. What it takes for two decent human beings to make it work and stick it out. The sacrifices one makes in the form of changes to your persona that lead to claustrophobia. Just like it is frustratingly boring for an extrovert to convert into an introvert, it is not really acceptable for a shy person to have bubbly enthusiasm as a permanent feature. These are all subtle issues that need delicate treatment. And here starts the real trouble. The timid Surendra, in his attempt to please Tani transforms into a bright gold and yellow creature, called - what else - Raj. Why? Can only the exact opposite personality can create impact and impress the Mrs? Isn't there anything in between? I'm not even interested in the missing 'how', the 'why' hasn't stopped bothering yet.We have a star amongst us who needs to keep everyone pleased. In the name of versatility, his character HAS to make a diagonally opposite change. Actually, I had just begun to enjoy Shah Rukh's performance as the middle-class government servant, Surendra Sahni, with the minor twitches and eye movements when suddenly he transfigured into a badly-dressed Shah Rukh Khan - eyebrow curled, whispering romantic inanities, piling on an inconsistent accent and only waiting for someone to grant him the permission to start stutt-stutt-stuttering. Many thanks to whoever said NO! The story is about Surendra and his wife. Why did we have Vinay Pathak playing Surendra's friend, the devil's advocate, the supposed ""inner voice""? His character was especially redundant given that Surendra had an alter-ego of his own. There wasn't enough room for Vinay to maneuver around and yet he can make over-the-top acting look adorable. Surendra's lady love, Tani, played by Anushka Sharma seems like she has the 'single-expression' training form the YRF's-Aishwarya-Rai school of non-acting. The other expressions are all taken care of by that drop of glycerin. The role of women in movies like these is very cleverly written. She's the center of the plot because the protagonist, his alter-ego and his friend all care for her, adore her, love her. But, the lady's part is ever-so sketchily written. What do we know about her? Are we made a part of her confusion? Do we know why she makes one decision or the other? No! And thus I resign to how these roles are written to give us a feeling that it's all about the woman. And the climax too...well...let's just say the movie has a male-chauvinistic touch. Also, our newly married couple lives in a socio-economic vacuum. They have no social pressures. In the heart of Amritsar, a married woman dances and prances about with a 'stranger'. Sure there are the token office mates, but here we see the one Panjabi family with only two members - the husband-ji and the wife-ji and the transformed husband-ji. And yet, it is not the take a chill-pill and watch kind of movies. The few facets of a utopian arranged marriage that rab ne bana di jodi touches upon are intriguing. I wonder how much those who can't identify with such an arrangement will appreciate it, but that the makers bothered deserves extra credit. What hurts is that if they are smart enough to hit upon these particular nuances, how can they monkey around so much for the rest of the movie? Songs: Anything about the music in the above review would be as out of place as the songs were in the movie. So, I'm attaching it here in the end like a song in the end credits. Songs have always been more about the lyrics for me. And I look forward to Jaideep Sahni's play with words. I call him the list-maker of the industry. His lyrics are usually in the form of lists. As boring as it sounds, they are usually interesting observations. The most ill-placed song ""hum hai rahi pyar ke"" had the most beautiful tweaking of phrases/songs/names of Hindi movies. It had delightful picturization and guest appearances too. It would have worked so much better as an award show performance. The rest was all ho-hum - lyrics, music, picturization, costumes, etc.]"
979,"[A few frames into the movie and I knew I'd be wasting the 3 hours to come if I chose to connect the proceedings on the screen with Memento. So, I sent Memento out of the dark hall. I began adjusting myself to the loud chant-like background music which over-compensated for the sparse dialogue. And my eyes refocused as per the over-zealous camera-person/editor's demands. Once I gave in, I saw myself getting involved with the characters, getting curious, heart-beating in the throat and all.Ghajini is one of those movies which I liked despite sensing the flavor of 'over-the-top' cinema in each of the 185 minutes. It absorbed me in its present scene and yet left a garish after-taste. It's all packed in there - drama, emotion, romance, action, song, dance, and a social message thrown in for no charge. Mixing of more than 2 genres annoyed me here, as always, e.g. I felt completely lost when the romance cropped up. And just imagine the state of my mind when songs were thrown in like rabbits jump out of magic hats - from nowhere. While on that note, my heart bled when I heard Prasoon Joshi pull a Sameer, save a few verses. Since the songs were picturised and choreographed well, I vote for a separate music video album for those who are interested. Do you?Anyway, scene-by-scene Ghajini grew on me. While I wouldn't have enjoyed any one thread of the plot by itself, the total added up to a little more than the sum of the parts. The sequences that worked without any caveat were the two junctions where the thriller was poised such that anxiety of the protagonist's next step raised my pulse-rate. Not as badly as Aamir Khan's pulsating nerves at his temples though. Wide eyes wanting to scream louder than what his voice box can create. It's inexplicable why his character transformed into this unwieldy monster when angry. Almost as if to show this is what this Khan is capable of -physical shape included. And note that I haven't yet spoken against how his short-term memory turns him into a superhero with super-duper action-powers. Now that I've done it, I had a huge problem with all the so-called 'crowd pleasing', 'mass appeal' items added. Once again, I'm a part of the masses and one in the crowd and I don't want it! Oh well...However, Aamir mesmerized me with his subtle reflexes in the emotional and romantic sequences. And Asin very charmingly supported him and entertained the audience. Her occasionally-irritating saccharine character was endearing enough for me to wish for her happiness. Though all very white, it was a part written with a little more meat than usually accorded to women in Hindi cinema. On the other hand, Jiah Khan had a sketch of a role which she fumbled through as ungraciously as she could. Why were her urdu lessons being publicized? She could barely hide the accent while speaking English!Ghajini's nowhere as smart or nearly as subtle as Memento but it's not completely stupid either. It's not even a fraction as mind-boggling as Memento either, but it does keep your brain ticking fast enough to ignore the huge leaps of faith every 10th minute. Ghajini is certainly one of those that people who love the melodramatic elements of Hindi cinema will enjoy but those who hate masala will hate. And either you have to be one of those who hasn't watched Memento or can block memories of Memento to make the most out of this one. I combined my tolerance of all things Bolly and ignored the original to like it as much as I did.]"
980,"[""Houston, we have a problem"" A huge problem. We are losing Ranvir Shorey to the big, bad world and...fast.Ranvir is 'Chopstick' who's a Feng Shastra specialist, and sells good luck amulets too. He'll do anything for every penny to get his daily bread. But, he's not entirely heartless. Looks like a nice gray character which Ranvir can do full justice to, right? Uhh...Friendly reminder: we have the heart-throb of the ""masses"", Akshay Kumar playing a simpleton, the village chowk fool, in this movie too. By definition, the entire cast HAS to speak at least 20 decibel levels above acceptable. And therein lies the problem. Ranvir, who can convey so much just by his eyes, let alone body language, is made to look like the comic filler found in every other slapstick. I guess slapstick has a role in entertainment. But, then can't there be something fresh, something that makes you roll on the floor laughing, literally. Sure, there are a few lines scattered around that are witty and bring a smile. But then every element of a 'masala' entertainer is like a punctuation for the next element. It' like the scriptwriter/director went -Oye! 19 minutes since we had an emotional scene. Time for one. Plug it in.  OR/AND Oh no! actors have too much glycerin, can't have the audience crying for too long. Where's that crotch joke we played 5 minutes ago? Will be perfect here. AND/OR  Oopsie-doopsie-poopsie...haven't had an action sequence in a while. Editor dear, let's put one in, right before this lovey-dovey song. So on and so forth... There would've been a miniscule amount of grace if any of these elements worked at least by themselves. But, na-ah. A smile here, a smile there. A good laugh with a hard slap on the forehead at the pointless predictability of it all.True, the action sequences and ensuing computer gimmickry are ght. A couple of 'wows' for Deepika Padukone's karate hu-aa. But that's in absolute terms. Relatively, an evening out with Matrix's Trinity and Kung Fu Panda might give a better dose of action, comedy and cuteness! There's something about Deepika that doesn't seem right. She looks alright, nothing overly charming or beautiful. But not 'the girl next door' either. She's not completely blank but is still going through the motions. Who am I kidding? There is really no character(s) under whose skin she could let her talent(?) grow and show. Yeah, yeah, yeah...time to give credit where it's due. Yep! There were a couple of things I liked. Akshay Kumar's character, Sidhu is extremely consistent. There's no point where the event of the moment inspired him to grow brains. The way the character grew gradually didn't seem out of place or sudden. Like with Nikhil Advani's earlier venture Salaam-e-ishq, I found the tiny spoof-type sub-plots interesting. There are these infomercials which pop up every once in a while. A comment on blind faith is made in passing. I'm curious how such issues make their way into an absolute crazy caper. Anyway too little, too late. This is all completely lost in the pure non-sense that the plot, the script, and the screenplay are. Yep, you are right! What more could I have expected!? ]"
981,"[Kabul Express deserves ovation just for the choice of subject and the courage to actually make a simple non-dramatic movie out of it. The literally breathtaking cinematography and the casually witty dialogues come only next. But, the target is very obviously the multiplex audience since a good part of the movie is in English.A serious political topic has been very craftily treated with humor. And it is not making fun of something or laughing at anyone, it is very situational. But, since all the messages are very subtle, the overall product ends up needing a certain punch. In fact, only the people who have seen the previews will understand the tongue-in-cheek humor of the last joke in the movie. The aim is to give a human face to the journalists, the Taliban, the Afghanis, and the Pakistanis. Now, how much of it is true, only people living in Afghanistan and Pakistan can tell, but the whole set-up looks very plausible. A good-humored cameraman (Arshad Warsi) and a somber journalist (John Abraham) get together to find the story of their life in Afghanistan. They are accompanies by a frustrated Afghani (Hanif Hum Ghum), who drives them around. The threesome find a dutiful member of the Taliban (Salman Shahid) and a bonus - a beautiful American journalist (Jessica Beckham). There is no boy-meets-girl routine. It is about how these characters spend a few hours of their life together. Watch out for yet another hilarious performance by Arshad Warsi. Kabir Khan actually makes all the characters look like they are from a slice of life. Their make-up, the lines they are given, the way they deliver them, the dialect, everything contribute to making the audience believe that they are for real. Only a talented director can neatly outline characters in the first few minutes of screen-time and keep them within those boundaries for the rest of the movie. This, of course, results in profanity and a documentary-type feel to the movie. But, remember this is a documentary with the backing of Yash Raj Films, so good money has been spent on the technical aspects. There is something about expanses of sand that is very pleasing to the eye. It is amazing how the dusty brown needs no other color to make it look prettier. Add to it, now and then, the backdrop of snow-topped mountains and we begin to agree with one dialogue that is in the trailers and translates to, ""What did these people achieve by destroying such a beautiful country?""]"
982,"[I dedicate this review to all those readers who have given me feedback...For those readers who want me to write about the story - The basic premise of the plot is that a sportsman cannot focus on his game if he is in love. How lame is that? You want more? The other premise is - in a marriage, if a spouse is idle, his/her devilish brain has to think that the partner is being unfaithful. Doesn't matter how madly they were in love, just ten screen-minutes ago! Do I need to talk about performances when Puneet Issar is the best deliverer of dialogues? The cameraman refuses to hold the camera in one position, almost through the whole movie. And for the very few times he does, there is nothing happening on the screen, everyone is still for melodramatic effect. This is for those of you who have been asking me for shorter reviews.  So what, if I bored myself for two-plus hours, it is not worth my readers' time to read a longer review than this. But, don't get used to it, not all movies can possibly be this bad!]"
983,"[The first half is hil-larious! There are really funny lines and situations in the second half too, but the compulsion to have a story breaks the flow. Nevertheless, all the laughs were the perfect medicine for my horrible cold. Yeah-yeah, I know my illness was not on their mind when they were making the movie, just thought I'd let you know because I felt like it. Just like, the writer threw in special effects, or her stand on social issues.Comedies like these bring out the dependencies between the dialogues and the comic timing. The great performances wouldn't mean anything without the witty lines. And as always, funny lines cannot tickle you if they are not delivered right. Someone please tell me, why don't real radio jockeys speak this sensibly? It's the serious parts (mostly in the first half hour after interval) where things drag. They do not gel with the general tone at all. The side-side story of the driver is out of place too. And the preachy tone in the end - Why? Why?? Why??? Also, why does the screenplay slacken in the second half.Acting by one and all is exactly what their characters demand. Yes, even Amisha Patel! When I first heard that she was playing a loud character, I was dreading the time I would see this movie. But, her restraint comes as a pleasant surprise. There are too many artistes to name them all here, but everyone has done their roles full justice.  And so have the costumes of at least some of the people. I was really kicked by how the geek was almost always dressed in a solid-colored collared T-shirt.Most of the characters and their idiosyncrasies were dealt a fair hand. I especially liked how the sexual orientation of some of the characters was handled sans the usual snickers associated with such issues in Hindi movies. A whole range of honeymooners is covered here, from the chauvinist who is more interested in photography than his wife to the couple who had no use for a camera, from the arranged marriage to the love marriages. While most characters are consistent, there are a few that leave you with questions. Since, discussing these would give out a little more than I like, check out the details section (spoilers there!). The songs look better than they sound. They are the kind that grow on you because you have seen them. The choreography of ""pyar ki ek kahaani"" is absolutely breathtaking.This movie has a very Hrishikesh Mukherjee feel to it. And that says a lot coming from a huge Hrishi-da fan. This is certainly the kind of light movie we needed after a series of serious movies we have seen in the last four weeks. If only, Reema Kagti had not worried so much about trying to squeeze in an actual story for every couple.]"
984,"[Your personality determines your taste. Now, that is a pretty obvious statement! I consider myself liberal, but the concept of a father falling in love with his daughter's friend just crosses a line that does not jell with my personality. Yeah-yeah, older people do fall in love with much younger people, and falling in love is natural. I understand all of that. But, reading about Nishabd gave me the feeling you get when you think of long nails screeching on a blackboard. Going in struggling to rid myself of that feeling, trying hard not to judge a book by its cover, and coming out with the thought, ""so, what is love, after all?"" - means the movie worked. It touched some chord somewhere, especially considering my attitude towards the subject. Ram Gopal Varma played his first card right. He cast the only person who could pull this off (commercially) in Hindi cinema. On your way out you really feel bad for Vijay (Amitabh Bachchan) even though he doesn't fit into your moral boundaries. Vijay's character is the most fleshed out and mostly consistent. The grim lighting in his monologue as narrator worked to show that he was a human who had resigned to his dark side. May be to the disappointment of many, the thing that works the best is the very conspicuous absence of lust. The 'lollipop' and Jiah Khan's 'finger in the mouth' in the promos are very misleading. There are no fireworks here. And that is the charm. Jiah might not be beauty personified but has screen presence and grabs your attention. And that is not just because she is skimpily clad. In a couple of scenes, just by one movement on her face, you knew what mood she was in. The dialogues are crisp and keep you interested throughout. The characters are left nishabd or at the most ek-shabd when there is no need for dialogues. However, on the whole the movie lacks depth. In tastefully handling the main relationship, the other relationships were ignored. The makers took the easy route. To highlight the intensity of the Vijay-Jiah relationship, they abandoned explanations for all other relationships.My other rather huge complaint is against the background music and the cameraman. What was with the suspense-thriller type of music and camera work? The aerial shots of the tea estates were well-shot, but most of the close-ups and the dancing of the camera from one angle to other were very annoying. So, is it okay now for a father to encourage a romantic relationship with his daughter's friend? No certainly not, not even if it is Amitabh Bachchan! But, it is a story told well through its dialogues and performances. Why not a higher rating then? Because it felt incomplete.]"
985,"[The best thing about the movie is its length - the torture lasts for a relatively short time. Doesn't the first lesson in ""Murder Mystery Story Writing -101"" cover that plot twists have to come at regular intervals? If it does not teach that, it must at the very least have mentioned that you certainly cannot have all your plot twists squeezed in the last fifteen minutes as a narrative, however short your movie is.Okay, maybe we didn't have time to do the murder mystery story writing course that I am raving about. But didn't ""Movie-Making -101"" mention that you need people who have some sort of acting skills to play the lead roles? Celina Jaitley's facial muscles, body language and dialogue delivery are so stiff that even if the entire budget of the movie was spent on getting an expression out of her, it wouldn't help. A few scenes in the dark were effectively used to hide her face when she needed to show charged emotions. Kindly appreciate how craftily I avoided using the words 'Celina Jaitley' and 'acting' in the same sentence. Oops! I just did it, will make a better attempt next time! The intimate scenes are steamy but exist only to sensationalize. Aftab was just alright.One person who surely has taken lessons is the lyricist, Sameer.  Of course, he quit after the basic course which taught him to use rhyming words at the end of each sentence. The music sounded like any other Himesh Reshammiya product, namely bad.Weak narration style, weaker character sketches, and godawful dialogues. Top it off with women who think sighing = acting. Now I need to find an education programme that teaches me to not watch everything that is churned out.]"
986,"[Don't write it off as yet another war movie. For one, it is more an 'escape' movie than a war movie. Secondly, it is a warm movie. It makes you think of the futility of it all - the partition, the wars themselves, the retention of the prisoners of war. The beauty of the movie lies in how focused the story is. There is no dilly-dallying, no silly or non-silly sub-plots. This is one of those rare scripts that can be appreciated without awesome or awe-inspiring dialogues. It has a gripping well-paced screenplay which surprises you, shocks you, and disturbs you. The dialogues are simple without being inane. In fact the restraint used in avoiding over-the-top heavy lines is simply admirable.  The very expected ""Pakistan-bashing"" dialogues are conspicuous by their absence. The background music is beautiful. However, my problem was with the over-use. The quality is ruined by the quantity. There was background music almost throughout the movie and it was loud - louder than the dialogue at times. The acting by all the lead actors is not top-notch but is good enough not to distract you from the story. It's the dialogue delivery of the supporting cast that is...weird. The actors playing roles in the Pakistani military brought laughs where none are warranted. And why-oh-why was the helicopter pilot doing a Dev Anand? No single scene might jerk tears but it surely brings a lump in your throat when the credits roll - not with the names of the crew members but with names and pictures of the real prisoners of war - the men who put their lives on line so that we could live comfortably.]"
987,"[In general, I like movies which have a strong compelling story. Once in a while though, comes along a movie like 'The Namesake' where the direction, screenplay and most importantly - the acting make you forget that the story is 'nothing spectacular'. And this is despite the fact that it is relatively slow paced.The story is no doubt a truthful and authentic narration of the average NRI family who moved abroad in the 70s - from the locations and sets to the accents and reactions of various characters. Especially, how Tabu and Irrfan lose the heavy Bangla accent gradually as the years go by. This could also mean that people who haven't lived outside India for an extended period of time might not identify with the characters. They will enjoy the narrative nevertheless. While the characters of Ashima (Tabu) and Ashoke (Irrfan Khan) are sketched out in quite some detail and are played out beautifully, some parts of Gogol's (Kal Penn) character seemed superficial, especially his love life. By any standards, this is a Tabu movie all the way. The lady gracefully ages from a daughter to a wife to a mother. It is amazing how with just one movement of her eye, you know exactly what her character is feeling.However, since it is a movie that tries to be as close to reality as possible, it is the missing nuances that bothered me a couple of times during the two hours. I must admit that I haven't read the book, and this could be one of those things that didn't find their way into the movie. High on emotions and jerking tears along the way, this one is worth a watch just for the performances. The beauty lies in the depth of the relationships touched upon. This is one of those rare occasions where how the story is told consumes the audience rather than the story itself.Update: Corrected spelling mistake - 'Ashim' replaced by 'Ashima'. Thanks Ashima (Comment #1 on notepad).]"
988,"[I felt sad while watching this movie...really really sad. No, it had nothing to do with the generally predictable storyline. It was also not because I saw too many genres being mixed to no particular end. It was the songs. Don't get me wrong, they had awesome lighting! I am certainly not saying I expected better from Himesh Reshammiya. Its not the video album style picturisation either. But, Jaaved Saahab? ""Aanan-Faanan"", ""Rafta rafta"", ""Chakna chakna""? Your poetry has moved me to tears many a time, and this time too, but obviously for all the wrong reasons. I am grieving because it feels like we are losing you Sir, to the inane-word-rhyming competition. Oh well, coming back to the story. It heavily draws from , Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (the sacrificing husband), Purab Aur Paschim (the patriotism bit). Cinematically, the parts shot in Punjab reminded me of Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge. One scene particularly reminded me of Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahi - would give away a little more than I like, if I said which one. In that sense then, they were original because they were the ones who thought of the combination! While there are some scenes that go contrary to your predictions, they are so unreal or out-of-place with the characterizations that they would make more sense as dream sequences. Akshay Kumar almost plays himself - a Punjabi dude who listens to music on an ipod while sporting a pink silk kurta - but with a remarkable amount of restraint. He doesn't get loud or go over-the-top. The flaw is actually in his character which forgets his Jatt pride because he is head-over-heels in love with the lady of his life. Katrina looks dainty and has her share of expressions. This might very well be her best performance till date. Wait dear, that is not a compliment just yet. Javed Shaikh (Parvez Khan) could use a lesson or two from Rishi Kapoor and Nina Wadia (his wife) for body language and dialogue delivery. The only reason for Upen Patel's track to exist is the 'Western Union' advertisement. I kid you not, they had to put an advertisement they had shot with Upen Patel and Katrina Kaif in it and that is why they chose this cast. That would also explain why Upen Patel was acting like he was a model - to maintain consistency. The entertainment in the movie is very sporadic. There are two sequences which really work because of their humor. These are not jokes you could narrate; it's the way it's done on screen that makes you laugh your heart out. That I guess makes the movie a comedy. There are a couple of emotional scenes where you really feel sorry for Arjun (Akshay Kumar). There's the romance for you. Then there is the routine of a foreigner belittling the capabilities of Indians, and an Indian giving it back to them and rightly so, with a slap across their face but sans violence. The good thing about the dialogue is that it is well delivered and that it doesn't get preachy about Indian culture and tradition. It just states facts. Soon enough, it digresses into some irrelevant facts and loses all grace. It's the reinforced stereotypes that got tiring. The racism - all white people (except one in this case) are mean to Asians and don't take a breather before ridiculing them. The fight of cultures - all the second generation immigrants do is drink, shop and party. And all first generation Indian immigrants make no attempt to socialize with the natives of the country they migrate into. In fact, they are so desperate to get their daughter an Indian groom, that they take pride when an Indian guy eve-teases her?!? Why is it painted so black and white and inevitably the black turning into white (no pun intended)? Anyway, shouldn't patriotism be stimulated more often than the few times an Indian actor gives a mouthful to the side character - who exists for the sole purpose of being whacked verbally anyway- in a movie? Shouldn't we wait at least until a match starts before bashing our cricket team? Oh, look who is digressing now...Maybe, its pure bad timing. Two movies released in a day both of which deal with the troubles of NRIs and the cultural disparities. Three in eight days. Too much of the same thing not presented in a very different way?]"
989,"[After a long long while, watching a bad movie did not make me grit my teeth in anger. It made me laugh in despair. Kudos to the 17 year-olds sitting beside me who were saying the lines before the actors in all the cliched scenes, and obviously giggling at their victory at the most serious spots. Only the dialogues can be blamed when you identify with the situation but not the characters. Especially since the performances were not half bad. The sick PJs (poor jokes) - yeah that's how sick and poor they were - try their best to make your eyes roll. But we are not going to give them that satisfaction, are we?Jimmy Sheirgill looked awesome and does whatever justice can be done to the aweful lines given to him. You actually feel bad for the actor Jimmy than his character. While Neha Dhupia is certainly not the slimmest stick around, she has a certain Rubenesque appeal. Her costumes were outright gorgeous, especially the saris, and she carried them well too. Her performance is obviously not the best but the lady's skills are improving gradually.   It's not good enough if you have individual alright performances. A couple has to have chemistry. Now, screen chemistry is a very abstract term. But I think it can be described as a failure when you understand the tension between a husband and wife but you don't feel tense. You can see they are trying to be romantic but it doesn't strike a chord. Again I think the actors cannot be held entirely responsible here. I think it was more to do with the camera decisions. In most of the shots between the couple, or any twosome for that matter, the camera was on the speaker. The listener was seldom in the frame. It was almost like each person's lines were shot separately. Yet again, Om Puri is wasted in an inconsequential loud role and Kamini Khanna is shrill. Speaking of which, it felt like all side characters were conversing in the highest possible pitch. The transition from one story to another was jerky and clumsy. Not to mention that the side stories could have been completely avoided since they were never meant to be given adequate footage. Also, this ain't the best time to show our man - Tendulkar hitting fours and sixes. I don't blame the makers since I assume they finished filming long before the World cup debacle. Or maybe it is the right time to remind us of our glorious past. Oh, here I go again...The mediocre presentation of the songs makes you forget that they are actually worth listening to. The ""rang barse"" (from Silsila) type holi song doesn't work at all because the jealousy has no background.  The college kids' need to learn lip-synching. The situations were created in almost every song to fit with the lyrics. Its supposed to be the other way around. ""Tere bin"" is certainly the best of the lot though and made a lot more sense because of the sub-titles.The silver lining is that the mercury is close to 40 degrees out there and the cinema hall had functioning air-conditioners. I am sorry - the silver lining is that the movie is not pretentious at all. It is being marketed as ""a feel good movie"", so you know everything will sort itself out even before you buy your ticket. As a little bonus, I don't have to spend energy on trying hard not to give the story away. About those dialogue-writers-in-their-own-right-giggly-teens - we were in the first-day-first-show, so it was not like they were seeing it for the second time. Besides, who would want to? Unless they go again just to ogle at Jimmy and Neha.]"
990,"[Provoked certainly brings attention to the plight of women at the hands of psychotic male chauvinists. So, what do you do when you want to get the average movie-goer to watch the sad story of a lady who is physically, emotionally and sexually abused by her husband? Get Aishwarya Rai (Kiranjit Ahluwalia) to be the lady! And she delivers with a performance that is, without any doubt, her best so far. Naah, by no means is it a flawless performance. Every once in a while Aishwarya does inadvertently slip into 'oh, I am sorry, I am this gorgeous supermodel made to look like a battered housewife' mode. But the positives easily outweigh the negatives this time around. And that is one woman who needs no make-up to look stunning! Performance-wise the transformation from an unsure, easily-dominated wife to a confident, inspirational woman was wonderful. Especially note the slouch turn into a confident straight back. The nuances of the complex character were captured well - frustration, anger, hatred, guilt, glimpses of happiness.What did not work for the movie though, are the gaps in the story. Though the memory-triggered flashbacks were a nice way to narrate the story, they ultimately failed to make an impact. They tried to do with dialogues what needed to be done through story and visuals. Also the shortcomings had a lot to do with the pace, the time allotted to each part of the story. While the first half took its own sweet time in establishing the background, the second half was left to cover a lot of ground (including the abrupt digressions for the side characters' stories).The biggest hole of them all was the torture itself that Kiranjit was subjected to. All through the movie you are expecting something gruesome to happen that will shake you from the inside. But it doesn't happen. And that is you leave the theater moved yet unconvinced - uncertain of what made a plain village girl take such a drastic step. Maybe they did not want to shoo away the audience with the gory details. But then, if the idea was to keep the audience interested, it desperately needed better dialogues. Especially, the lines given to the beautiful Nandita Das were lousy. Again, the inevitable tussle between dramatize-for-effect and stick-to-reality. Tricky one, indeed. The only thing other than Aishwarya's moving performance that makes it worth a watch is the subject itself. This subject needs attention and is certainly more than one woman's story. But will it make anyone stand up for the cause?]"
991,"[This movie is about the rivalry between two music composers based in New York. The key word here is 'two'. Who wins when you have Himesh Reshammiya Vs. Himesh Reshammiya? Don't know about that. But, I surely know who loses. Us! Mind you, we are supposed to believe that one of them is actually a genius. All this while there is absolutely nothing for you to distinguish one composition from the other. I was thoroughly amused when Reggie (Upen Patel) taunts AJ (Bobby Deol) for having silly lyrics to his tunes. Actually, he was just stating facts. But I burst out laughing when he starts singing his own lyrics. They were equally bland! All obviously written by none other than Sameer. Now, we have started rhyming across songs - 'jhoom jhoom' to 'boom boom'.The least you can do when you set out to make a musical is provide entertainment via visually appealing songs. Better use of colors would have added infinitely to the experience. How about having decent choreographers or casting better dancers? Of all the people, Bobby Deol?!? Maybe that is why the camera man was getting all enthusiastic, so that we would not be able to focus on the aerobics in the disguise of dancing. Speaking of the camera - the close-ups were way too many. Okay, granted, the only reason for Kangna Ranaut and Celina Jaitley to be in the movie was for the curves they are endowed with, and the catwalk they have picked up in the name of body language. But, if you are going to show their face in close-ups, I mean, if that's what you really want to do, can we at least have the complete face with chin and all. On a side note, Kangna's eye make-up was the worst I have seen in a long time. And Celina refuses to give a whole-hearted smile lest it spoil her make-up.I am totally convinced now that Upen, Kangna and Celina come from the school of under-acting where, you know, they teach you the all-in-one expression and punish you if you move your eyelid more than a quarter of a centimeter (except for blinking). And Bobby Deol comes from the school of over-acting, where acting is all about yelling and imposing melodrama on the audience. Oooh! Does that mean we have perfect performances as an average then? Never mind...The script has the lousiest characterizations, which alas, we cannot blame because the characters are lousy! Egoistic psychopath Vs. Overconfident nincompoop. Anyways, you empathize with none and cheer when both of them find their way to the hospital for some reason or the other. The shoddy screenplay doesn't help at all. Some scenes look like they were thought of first and squeezed into the movie because they seemed cool, e.g., the fire scene.Honestly, the basic premise of the story - competitors trying to outsmart each - other - could have been a compelling watch. Especially, if they had dwelled upon the psyche of the self-acclaimed genius who is actually mediocre. But, the basic premise is left at that. It finds support in none of the other aspects of film-making. We, thus, are left with a product which has no head or tail - and you could be accused of high expectations if you wanted anything like reason or logic.Borrowing a line from the movie, ""What you don't know, does not exist"". How I wish that I did not know about this movie and that in turn would make it not exist...]"
992,"[The oil being the glossy glitter associated with mainstream Hindi cinema. Isn't it a shame this movie is being called one without ""stars""? As soon as Vinay Pathak makes me laugh with the way he locks his briefcase, he is my star. If I yell, ""aaa-ouch"" when Rajat Kapoor gets hit on his back that is already hurting, isn't he doing something right? Dialogues that characters are made to repeat at every opportunity possible usually make me sick. But, this time, I could have been caught laughing out loud at a couple of such dialogues. Here, they are subtle and an integral part of the personality - not forced, not squeezed in to increase the line-count of the actor. I laughed in anticipation every time. For some reason even the predictable misunderstandings made me laugh.  And just when I thought, ""okay enough now, this is not going to be funny anymore"", the character didn't say it again and the movie ended soon thereafter. The makers knew not to push it too far. That understanding, and the ability to resist the temptation to do it just one more time, is creditable. Sorry, didn't mean to take away anything from the lines that were not repeated. Most of the dialogues are witty and keep you in splits throughout! Like some of the dialogues, things that irritate in real life are used to irritate the characters and get a laugh out of the audience. E.g., the sound effect used to exaggerate the noise created while handling a plastic bag is just hilarious and needs special mention. This is how cinematic liberties should be taken. And not just because you are allowed to. There were a few things that, maybe, were 'outside the scope of the movie' from the maker's point of view but left the audience with questions. Like the inconsistency in Sarika's character. (Read more in the  ""what didn't work"" section). The other problem was that in his very short role, Ranveer Shorey overacted. Yes, you read that right. Granted he was asked to pull a face and modulate his voice in a certain manner. But it didn't work. His character looked rather out-of-place in the otherwise believable set of characters. However, here is something that worked. More than half of Milind Soman's lines were very appropriately - Laugh. And he did laugh heartily. The most wonderful part is that the movie is as much a joke on the simpleton clerk as it is on the arrogant upper class businessman. And yes, these certainly are the kinds of characters that you would be annoyed at if you were with them, but are ready to burst out laughing at because they are with someone else. They make you fondly remember the guys in college who were sources of entertainment not because of any ""talent"" but because of their personalities. I wouldn't wait for the DVD because this is the kind of comedy that needs to be encouraged - intentional.]"
993,"[Scene 1 was so bad (read more in my notepad), that I thought, ""Oh cool, things can only get better!"". But, the makers took up the challenge and went from worse to worst in no time. So much so, that I am inspired. I have taken up the challenge of being good to the movie. Therefore, I will try my best to refrain from words like - cliches, cinematic liberties, inanities, contrived, predictable, unoriginal and the like. Not a good start now, is that?So, this morning, I visited beautiful South Africa and was taken on a walking tour of the dazzling Cape Town without ever being there. Thanks to Kajal (Ayesha Takia) who prefers walking even though she owns a car. Kudos to Ayesha for taking up this job. Having her around brought back fond memories of Dor and what she is really capable of. The other actors meet expectations. The phrase ""the less said the better"" comes to mind. Since I am trying to focus hard on the ""better"", I choose to say ""less"".  One thing is for sure, there is surely no room for getting bored with monotony. The characters have a lot to say by way of profound dialogues on love and life. Yes, they are clueless about what they want from life. But so are many of us in real life, right? And every time the dialogues start getting heavy on you Arjun's (Tusshar Kapoor) friends show up as comic relief and crack ""the"" joke. Dutifully, the main characters creep in reminding you that it is a love story and not slapstick. The lack of monotony can also be credited to the decent sounding songs. Copied, I hear you say? The originality, dear friends, has been saved for the lyricist. Honestly (not that I have been dishonest so far), it is the best attempt at poetry in recent times. The choreography, gives me the confidence to make another attempt at dancing. It's all pretty mechanical, after all. Have not been very successful at keeping to my challenge, have I? Hey, cut me some slack. This was my first attempt at being positive about a positively bad movie. Worry not. Such attempts will be few and far between. I am not very good at being nice for too long. The nastiness will be back for the next bad movie generated.]"
994,"[Finally!! Finally, we have been treated like people with thinking capacity and have not been taken for granted as an audience. Thank you Mr. Rajkumar Hirani for entertaining us wonderfully!!! This movie is about non-violence and is, as contradictory as it may sound, very contemporary. It is about using Gandhian principles to deal with the common man's current day-to-day problems. And here is the beauty of the script, it is not preachy! Smiles, laughter, misty eyes, tears are abundant on both sides of the screen. Munnabhai and Circuit are adorable, articulately sketched out characters. The characterization is maintained in the songs too - from the music and lyrics right to the simple and sweet choreography. Not only do Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi play out their characters as if they are living them, it also felt like they enjoyed every bit of their roles. You sense their energy. The chemistry between them is exceptional, especially in scenes with just the two of them - both at dhobi ghat and outside. Vidya Balan's smile brings freshness to the screen, especially while paying tribute to Robin Williams (Good Morning, Vietnam). Boman Irani playing a bitter-sweet character has his comic timing as right as ever. Dilip Prabhawalkar's voice modulation is spot on and kudos to the make-up person too. Familiar faces from Munnabhai MBBS bring warm memories from the first movie in the Munnabhai series.  The songs, for a change, add value to the script since the lyrics of almost all songs are very situational. However, that means that they may not make sense when you are only listening to them. The story and script skillfully avoided certain things. For instance, the generation gap problem was not over used, the psychiatry element was not left unexplained, and the love angle did not go through misunderstanding after misunderstanding. It is also refreshing to see that there is no unnecessary show of snow in Switzerland using a dream sequence as an excuse.  This is a product of excellent teamwork. The director could not have done it without the actors who in turn could not have done it without the dialogues and lyrics, and of course the dialogues would be worthless if it were not for the story and the script, which in the first place could have been ruined through improper execution by the director.  Of course, nothing in life is perfect, right? ... there are a few lapses but they are worth ignoring. There is a little extra melodrama, a few extra tears, a couple improbable coincidences, an overestimated use of World Space, and a few unnecessary dialogues considering the audience is being treated with respect. Also, the dancers on the side could have done with a few expressions.  This is no doubt a feel good movie, but it has that something extra which you begin experiencing once the credits start rolling and the 'EXIT' lights turn on. The issues raised will stay with you after you leave the hall (unless of course you are a skeptic). All-in-all a must watch for one and all! Thought for the day - Bapu did his job, Munna has done his, will we do ours?]"
995,"[This story tries to address the complexities of relationship(s), and that's what it remains...a trial...it succeeds at absolutely nothing! The movie starts out with almost all characters being nice normal people, and then most of them become obsessed lovers. At one point you start feeling bad for almost all characters but then end up sympathizing with none. Someone ought to teach Urmila Matondkar the art of moving facial muscles. (Maybe, just maybe, we could see some of the facial muscles if her make-up person didn't do his/her job so over-zealously.) Come on lady, no one groans and moans all the time, your glycerin-moistened-eyes don't convince us that you are sad and just because you widen your eyes to double their size we can't be made to believe that you are scared/surprised. Just imagine, your acting is pretentious! I wasn't sure whether Urmila was enjoying being touched by Sanjay Suri or dreading it. Granted, the story line asked for both, but the sad part it is you can't make out which one is when.  It is sad that Juhi Chawla, Sanjay Suri, and Jimmy Sheirgill put together couldn't make up for the lot of bad performances surrounding them, they are looking fabulous though. Sanjay and Jimmy have tried to make the most of badly drawn out characters, what were they pumping so much iron for? Some really good talent has wasted its time on a script that goes hay-wire. Other characters that are better sketched out are murdered by awesome bad acting.  A few things have been handled better compared to the rest of the movie. The scenes showing Sanjay Suri's imagination running wild were played out well. But how can a script as grim as this have either a dying person or someone who cares for the dying character cracking jokes a few moments before the death. The light moments make you laugh because they are sad not funny. The mundane dialogues and songs don't help either. Now I am confused - bad dialogues or poor dialogue delivery, lousy direction or mediocre story-line...hmmmm...]"
996,"[Pyar Ke Side Effects pleasantly presents the phases an average urban man-woman relationship goes through - hooking up, breaking up, and making up. The script does stick to its basic aim of narrating a light but neat story but the narration loses focus after the first hour. The hooking up phase is kept lively with humour and the making up part is short and thus sweet. However, the breaking up phase drags, the characters become very predictable and it is really sad to see them do the silliest things. The characterization of the lead pair is pretty accurate, i.e. a man in Rahul Bose's situation and mind-set would behave like Rahul does and so would a woman in Mallika Sherawat's shoes. Rahul also speaks to us through the movie and has done a great job of switching between talking to his co-actors and us. Mallika does have a very girl-next-door-face, I can't see what the hype is all about? Her dialogue delivery and acting (if you can actually call it that!) is very plain. However, it is the rest of her that could get a few hearts thumping, oh now I see... However, if you are there to see some talent, its Rahul's comic timing that pulls the movie through. Unexpectedly though, the two of them together look fantastic. For a change, the intimate scenes between the lead pair makes us feel that the couple is actually attracted to each other!! The other actors are very ignorable; they are either too loud or too flat. However, it does not strike us immediately because the dialogues perfectly suit the characters in the first half of the movie. It is towards the intermission, that the dialogues start losing their charm and in fact become a tad redundant. The concept of Rahul acting and speaking to us intermittently is carried a bit too far and thus ends up being repetitive and non-entertaining by the end. The direction style is different, but unfortunately different is not necessarily always the best. Some really funny lines and analogies lose their effect because of the number of times they are mentioned. The dialogue-writer needs to understand, that we got it the first time! The supposedly touching scenes do not really have an impact. The music doesn't do much for the ears, especially for people who are not into the night club culture. The choreography isn't very exciting either. What sort-of saves the movie is the fact that the story doesn't waver and is very smooth right till the end. The costume designers and make-up people need special mention because the characters were not dressed like they were out to party 24x7. Thumbs up to the story, Rahul's acting, and costumes. But a great opportunity was lost because it didn't look like enough attention was paid to the other departments.]"
997,"[An average middle class family has to bend rules and give-up on its ideologies to achieve a very simple goal. And there is always the generation gap to deal with. That's serious stuff. The name of the movie is hilarious. The posters and the one promotional song that I had seen made it look like a slapstick comedy. Hardly...it is not even borderline-comedy! Not surprising, considering the movie is produced by an advertising agency. They really cannot exist without misleading marketing! Overall, the movie is a quite dull. There is something right about the execution, though. It is admirable that Dibakar Banerjee kept the characters simple and carefully avoided the glitter and glamour, the song and dance. Some parts are handled pretty well. For example, the way a dream is used to show a facet of a character; the way different characters react to an announcement that a member of their family is going to the US; the way props are used to intimidate characters; the way IIT-Delhi T-shirts are used instead of GAP. But then, ordinary characters that you can identify with...get boring! It lacks the intensity, the crispness, needed to make a movie out of the subject.The plot does not help too much either, nothing exciting happens through the movie. If the story had a couple twists, it could have kept the interest alive. Thankfully, the songs that play in the background, help break the monotony. Watch out for some good performances though. Anupam Kher makes your heart go out for Mr. Khosla. I especially liked Navin Nischol's role and the way he has played it. Parveen Dabbas, Tara Sharma, and Ranvir Shorey show how they are learning with experience. Boman Irani plays a creepy property dealer. Now, the way this character is presented is irritating. For one, it is the character inconsistency. In the first half he had this street-smart personality and in the second half the simplest person pulled wool over his eyes. Then there is the acting itself. Boman Irani does this thing with his left nostril and smirks, to make him look his character. It worked for the first minute of screen time, but that's how his nostril and half-lip stayed through the movie. In his opening shot, he has this cool lighting on the lower half of his face and bottom-up camera angle that makes him look sinister. But then the same effect is used on other characters and it loses its significance. While we are on photography, the wide angle is over-used. Also, it is annoying when the expressions of a character change between the close-up shot and a zoom-out in the same shot but from a different angle. Maybe, it is all deliberate and had a purpose in the larger scheme of things. But if while watching the movie, I have time to think about what the cameraman is doing, then, either the cameraman is not doing his job right or the director.]"
998,"[...and for the unemotional types- it is a good story, it is well-narrated. It is dark in there, nobody will see the tears, so it can't dent your self-esteem!Dor unveils one emotion after the other - intimacy, loneliness, grief, hope, resignation, oppression, guilt, greed, contempt, liberation and of course love. Yes, most of the story is heartbreaking but the narration is beautifully executed and has enough light moments to keep your interest alive. This tale is about two women from diverse backgrounds having common aspirations - but while one has the courage and confidence to make her own choices, the other is resigned to her fate. The spectacular locations and magnificent cinematography alone warrant a trip to the cinema hall. Ayesha Takia has uncovered a new dimension to her talent by bringing out the complexity of her character by a moving performance. Though Gul Panag's dialogue delivery lacks depth and she has yet to master the complete range of expressions, she does look promising. Their make-up (or lack thereof) leaves you speechless. It actually defines and contributes to the characters. In their first shots you can immediately point out that Ayesha is the lively-yet-timid kind and Gul is the strong-willed one. While the focus of the first half hour is to build the storyline, the simple dialogues get dull. And enter Shreyas Talpade! He literally brings life to the screen every time he is on it. The credit goes to Nagesh Kukunoor for bringing out the best in the trio. He has, in fact, pulled off some scenes without any background music. And hey, one more movie without any lip-synching!The other artists are just about mediocre, including Nagesh. Looks like he will need a co-director to direct him. Or may be it is the character inconsistency. It is not fair when a character unwarrantedly becomes malicious without warning. Also it is disappointing when a movie of this caliber has a nasty character change tune just because she is ""influenced"" by one dialogue that was said to her. Someone, some day has to come up with a better climax, or at least a new way of showing, ""I have to get to the train station, or all hell will break loose"". Nagesh has taken the first step by hushing the dialogue, but it is still too dramatic and long-drawn compared to the rest of the movie.]"
999,"[Same old story, same old acting, same old music, same old choreography, but fresh direction! Shirish Kunder has used a very different and enjoyable style to direct flashbacks and dream sequences. Such innovativeness needs to be applauded and encouraged. Jaan-E-Mann can be appreciated for this particular novel approach, but do not expect anything more. Note that the direction is new, not the comedy. It is almost all...SLAPSTICK!!! 3-4 good laughs are not enough to pull a movie, which is based solely on comedy, through. It is a shame when embellished colour, lighting, and photography have to be used to convey emotions. It is a shame when wigs and exaggerated make-up have to be used to compensate for the lack of comic timing by our ""stars"". It is a shame when Anupam Kher, Anupam Kher...the immensely talented comedian is unnecessarily dwarfed and has a nasal voice to make the movie funny. Now, that is a disgrace! Moreover, a generally overenthusiastic cameraman has used a weird camera angle and even weirder camera tricks to create the midget effect. Ridiculous, not funny, I say. And anyway, do people really think midgets are people to be laughed at?!? The rest is just ordinary. The story is just slightly, very slightly amended from your regular love-triangle-catapulting-woman-between-two-men affair. The much advertised twists will hardly bend a nerve in your brain.  The screenplay is choppy; transition from scene to scene is abrupt. And the movie a good 30 minutes too long. Preity Zinta does yet another 'girl friend/spouse' role, with her regular flair. She looks beautiful, especially in the pinks and peaches. Salman Khan uses his superbly toned body to overcome the lack of talent - again; someone ought to tell him muscle movement is good for his face too. Akshay Kumar once more wastes his potential on clowning around aimlessly. Aman Verma looks like he is competing for the loudest speaker of the year award. The performances are not helped by the inappropriate sound mixing. In some of the songs, the voices are so loud that you barely can listen to the music and in some scenes the background music overshadows the dialogue. The music of 'humko maloom hai' is agonizing, especially 'galtiyaaaaaaaan'. The lyrics of the 'sad - humko maloom hai' and 'ajnabee shehar' are good. But looks like Gulzar saahab was specifically asked to write extra simple lines for the target audience. Most of the other songs are outright prose - not poetry. But, hey it's the festive season, who cares about plots and good lines? There are enough takers out there for tomfoolery, and this one is the giver. ]"
1000,"[I forgot...I knew it was a Priyadarshan movie...and yet I forgot to carry cotton to stuff my ears. Of course, everything was just too loud, as expected. Not to mention the added bonus I would have received, of not having to listen to the oh-so-pathetic dialogues.What I didn't forget though, was that Priyadarshan mentioned in one of his interviews, ""No one with brains should watch Bhagam Bhag"". Honestly, I listened to him, I had left my brains home. Believe me, I was not looking for logic in a single scene, let alone in the movie as a whole. I didn't realize that I was not to look forward to a few good laughs from a comedy! The absurdity of it all does not make you laugh either. I refuse to accept that the audience is expected to laugh at Akshay Kumar's face stuck between two half-naked hairy butts. The only line that made me laugh hard was the dig Bunty (Akshay Kumar) takes at Akshay Kumar the real-life actor. And I had a smile in one of the other very forgettable scenes between Akshay Kumar and Govinda. That was my laugh and a half. No amount of decent acting by Akshay Kumar, Govinda, and Paresh Rawal's could save the movie. The train of thoughts going through my mind while watching the movie....Can't blame the dialogue writer if he has to try and find some way of doing justice to a shoddy screenplay. Almost any of the sub-plots could be cut-and-pasted in any order and we would have a similar product....But, how can it be the screenplay's fault if it has to contrive and adjoin five stories that have nothing to do with each other?....Nope, certainly cannot point fingers at the director if he has zilch to work with....Oops....they are all done by the same people - dialogues, screenplay, story (ies), direction....Hey! The audience is supposed to be dumb, not the makers. With all the control, they surely are capable of coming up with something better. This is one of those rare movies where you wait for a song, however irrelevant. You just want the characters to stop talking! Indeed, the songs were a welcome relief. 'signal' and 'tere bin' have good music. Sameer has added a new set to his list of rhyming words 'afreen - nazneen - dilnasheen'. As always, the words that come before and after the rhyming words do not matter. It is exasperating when you cannot enjoy a movie even if you give your brain a vacation. Such movies don't make me laugh, they make me angry!]"
1001,"[This is one of those movies that start off with a lot of promise and slowly degenerate over the next couple of hours.Arjun Rampal's character is established really well in the first half an hour. Your smile will remain intact in these thirty minutes with the tongue-in-cheek humor. Then nothing happens for the next hour or so. An average movie-goer would know by now, how this story is likely to culminate. Thus no one is surprised by the climax in the last couple of reels. What surprised me though is that after having taken all cinematic liberties they actually tried to get away with dressing the lead lady (Vipasha Agarwal) in the same dress throughout the movie. Amazing!All the other characters are half-baked including the other main character. What her motivations are in whatever she does is not explained. But both Arjun and Vipasha look great. Arjun has performed well in patches. I wish actual TV hosts would speak as normally as he did. He was brilliant in some scenes and just-about-okay in some. His performance could, maybe, have been better if he didn't have the extra stress of being the producer too. Just like an Indian cricket captain can't bat consistently due to the additional pressure. Though most of Vipasha's scenes needed her to just smile knowingly, she does show promise. Chunkey Pandey has given a controlled performance. Bomani Irani and Sonali Kulkarni are wasted in loud roles. Why are these typical loud roles so irrestible for directors? I truly hope the special appearances by Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan were not to rope in their fans to the theatres. The problem is that the romantic scenes don't make you feel for the characters. The touchy ones don't pull any heart strings. There are some really good funny dialogues but they aren't enough to last the movie. There are half-decent songs but no poetry. Everything looks like it has not been fully thought through.]"
1002,"[Remember that friend of yours? The one who forced you into watching a crappy movie you didn't want to go to at all? Perfect time for revenge - praise this one and send him/her to the movie. Of course, you still have to figure a way to keep yourself out of it.The tag-line reads - Why should boys have all the fun? The only fun the story-writer could imagine girls having involved either talking about their men or getting a man for the only unattached girl. But obviously, the only fun thing to do is to get various types of beauty treatments. Someone here needs a better exposure to girls!!! It's sad to realize that these actresses agreed to portray their gender in such light. The story starts at a good pace with three friends  (Rekha, Vasundhara Das, Kim Sharma) wanting to find the fourth one (Mahima Choudhary) a groom. It finishes with trying to make you feel sorry for Rekha's selfish character and her four failed marriages. The second half is like you are in a car driving uphill in fourth gear. How it travels from the first to the second is something you can live without watching. I am not sure whether the gorgeous Rekha ""needs"" to do this or not. What I am certain of though, is that she ""should"" not do such movies. We should thank the director for letting her be on her own for most of the second half where she plays the darker shades of her character. But it was too little and too late. Also, he took it too far and let her do it for too long, making it boring. Though I have my reservations about the use of 'din dhal jaaye' (the classic from Guide) for that particular scene, Rekha has sung it beautifully. Yes, you read that right, the lady can sing! And as always can seduce. That too, being fully-clad - full-sleeve blouse, sari, et al. Compared to the other barely-clad women who could hardly deliver a dialogue, let alone successfully seduce.  The technical values were off too - dubbing, music, make-up, cinematography (half the movie looked like it was shot out of focus), and dialogues (five half-funny lines don't count). First half - loud, second half - sermonizing, whole movie - pointless: doesn't quite work for an audience that wants to be entertained. Oh, by the way, you also have to make sure that the friend we were talking about does not read this review.]"
1003,"[An excess of anything causes indigestion. Then may it be the loud drums and violins trying to follow the pace of your heart-beat or the close-ups / top and bottom angles. Note that I am not even complaining about the bloodshed and the gore. In fact, I missed the profanity. Hard core Mumbai goons and no abuse? The only things that make Risk watchable are the fantastic performances and a few twists in the plot. The story is nothing new. Two gangs wanting to beat each other down as if that is the primary business they conduct. But, what scores is the way in which they beat each other. Through the two hours, the audience is wondering, ""oops...now how will he get out of this one?"" and that is what a drama should do. The only issue is that the end does not leave anyone surprised. Watch out for some marvelous performances. Randeep Hooda need not prove himself any more in this genre, he has most certainly mastered the serious character - the dialogue delivery, the timing. Vinod Khanna plays his part with elegance and style. The rest of the supporting cast looks perfect for their roles too. Oh yes, there is Tanushree Dutta too, or is there? I am pretty sure, she too will forget that she had a role in this movie, very soon. What on earth was a song like 'hichki' doing in a movie like this? It was point-blank out-of-place! Are we so desperate to please the masses that not only do we bring in an absolutely out-of-place love angle but have a Miss India who has no qualms about gratuitous show of skin? 'out-of-place' is the only phrase that seems in the right place! Vishram Sawant uses music to cover conversations that the audience don't really need to listen to. The same technique was used in 'D'. Surely, there is no problem with reusing a technique from an earlier movie, but doing it through the movie? Was there a lack of talent in the dialogue department? Sort-of. There were some really good dialogues mixed with regular, very forgettable lines. Agreed, like love triangles, there are only so many ways in which gang-wars can be treated. But, today we need something, something more to make the movie stand out. And that is what Risk misses. Or maybe it is time for the director to move on to another genre...]"
1004,"[The mere sound of the phrase ""plight of widows"", grips your heart. Is it then, that difficult to make a movie on this issue, which stirs you from the inside? Looks like it is. Water,  leaves you feeling cheated because you are still waiting for a punch, a hard hit on your sensibilities, even after the movie is done. The movie starts with a bang. The opening sequence makes your heart go out for little Chuyia (Sarala), the 7-8 year old widow. But, the narrative begins to fizzle out after the first ten minutes and never regains the impact. And the climax seemed very illogical. The only other touching moment comes when the lead pair has its first romantic rendezvous. Though not magical, it is very sweet.  However, you have to give it points for not being preachy or whiny. It just tells a story, and lets the audience answer the unasked question, ""Is this the way it should be?"" This movie is worth watching for its performances. Widows of different age groups having varied temperaments, have been portrayed really well. You can almost see how the younger one can be the one in the next age group when she grows older. Sarala makes you feel for her innocent but rebellious attitude. Lisa Ray, the teen widow, wants to be saved from her loveless life in the widow asylum.  Seema Biswas, plays to perfection, the role of a widow in her late 30s who has resigned to her fate, but still understands the desires of the younger widows. You can see the strength she gives them despite her internal struggle to stick to her faith, in both her expressions and her body language. Manorama, plays the classic pain-in-the-wrong-place-opportunist. Her double standards dare you to defy her. You know she has done her job well, when you feel like giving her one tight slap right across the face! Vidula Javalgekar plays a minor role of a widow (called aunty by the other widows) who is approaching the end of her life. Her mannerisms and love for food reminds you of Chunibala devi who played a very similar role in Pather Panchali. The problem is that though the individual characterization and performances don't disappoint, most of the relationships between the individuals is underdeveloped...certainly wanting of more chemistry. Be it the relationship between Narayan (John Abraham) and Kalyani (Lisa) or Madhumati (Manorama) and Chuyia (Sarala), it was difficult to understand the motivations. E.g., Why did Narayan like Kalyani? The movie did not show any reason for Chuyia to obey Madhumati. The beginning makes you squirm and feel ""oh boy! I am really going to be depressed at the end of this movie"". But, fortunately or unfortunately, that does not happen.]"
1005,"[If you were to graph your enjoyment thorough the 3.5+ hours of the movie, it would be a bell-shaped curve. At first you are holding your head at all the forced attempts at comedy and drama. Then you begin laughing at the silliness of it all. Slowly the stories start growing on you and before you know it you are fond of the characters. Then comes interval. Things gradually slide down with very intentional melodrama and preachy ""holier-than-thou"" lines. And you are back to holding your head. This is certainly not the kind of movie where we are allowed to say things like, ""Yeah right! Like that happens in real life"". If you want logic, stay home. Treat the movie as one big cinematic liberty and it is enjoyable. The movie weaves you through different stages that a couple goes through to get and stay married. And it does that very smoothly, with grace and elegance. Since there is so much ground to cover the pace keeps you interested till its time for the stories to wrap up.Interestingly, a unique route is taken to avoid confusion that six stories could cause - don't make it six ""complete"" stories at all! There are two main stories, three side stories, and then there is the comic-relief no-connection-to-main-story-story. Even more interesting is the fact that all the male characters are more full of life than their partners.The songs as a whole, contribute to the positive experience. Sameer has surprised us with the lyrics of the touching ""Ya rabba"". It was as heart-warming to watch as it is to hear.  ""Dil kya kare"" and ""Salaam-e-ishq"" too are sweet - both to ears and eyes. Two things that strike are the use of bagpipes and the sizeable screen time given to Priyanka Chopra. The directorial spoof-touch given to the movie was very impressive. What is it a spoof of? Everything you ever associated with the phrase masala movie (or ""Bollywood"", if you must). Name it and you have it - wet skimpily-clad seductress, falling car, temple bells, random people on street clapping when guy proposes his girl, a comic-relief sub-plot, the mandatory airport scene where our characters suddenly get all control over the staff, the boy arriving at girl's wedding to stop it... Oops! Didn't mean to scare you. Not to worry, it is all done with great style. They actually have the characters hold video cameras to shoot the on-goings throughout the first half - symbolically reminding you that you are in a movie. The ""masala"" gift is wrapped with a tastefully bright paper. And the bow on the top is the take-off on a leading director and a real-life celebrity couple.A love story is supposed to evoke emotions. Many love stories should do so even more. But not one of the six is a tear-jerker. Can't blame the script. The stories were appropriately fleshed out. Special mention needed for the Anil Kapoor-Juhi Chawla story. All the performances were absolutely great! Especially Akshaye Khanna and Govinda's comic timing.  It is the dialogues that lacked impact. There were some very good comedy lines (mostly given to Akshaye Khanna), but there were very few that made your heart go all out for the character.  The basic question is - is it worth spending 45 minutes at each end in despair for the almost 2.5 hours of good entertainment in between? Yes, but you don't need to rush to the halls.]"
1006,"[Yes, it is yet another movie about the victimized protagonist succumbing under the pressure of the ""system"".  But this one is dealt with a touch of humor, dark at times, but funny nevertheless. The flow in the screenplay is gripping. The power flow from the street beggar to the business world - via the traffic signal leader, the mafia, and the politicians - has been shown with great expertise. Madhur Bhandarkar needs to be applauded for the choice of subject for various reasons. We all see street beggars everyday. Either we choose to ignore them or we choose to feel good about ourselves by throwing a coin or two at them. Either which way, most of us certainly choose to forget them after the 100 odd seconds we spend cursing the red light. Then would we want to spend the 100 odd minutes watching a movie about the life at that traffic light? Huge risk! The movie reflects what most of us believe to be true. The people at these lights are victims, but they are liars too. They are actors performing live. All of them are part of a huge scam - Right from the child in the arms of a young mother to the almost nude, crazy old man. The director has taken up the challenge of making you empathize with all of them - right from the gay sex worker to the loser drug addict. By interval time, you are settling down to the idea of having a story-less movie, saying to yourself ""oh, I see, this is one of those slice-of-life things"". Then slowly you see the story emerging and very smoothly translating into a compact climax. The ending had a punch with just the right amount of drama and not much ado. The acting of the main characters is mostly a pleasant surprise. Kunal Khemu says his lines in a monotonously annoying manner. You want to yell out ""talk properly, for heaven's sake"". And suddenly you realize that is exactly what you would say to a person with an ""I-own-this-place"" attitude, which happens to be the character he plays. And then you warm up towards the character. Similary, though Neetu Chandra, Konkona Sen Sharma, and Ranvir Shorey (especially his introductory scene) have very small roles to play, not for one line will you feel that they are not the character they are playing. The one thing that did not work though is the make-up of Kunal Khemu and Neeta Chandra, they looked artificially dark. Due to the number of lives a traffic signal nexus touches (at least 50), there is a long list in the supporting cast. Overall, the supporting cast is average. While some got under the skin of the character (Upendra Limaye) the others delivered their plain dialogues rather unconvincingly (Sudesh Mishra). The dialogues are very clearly not meant to be either profound or dramatic. However, the funny lines do achieve their purpose of getting a good laugh out of you.  Traffic Signal  will be added to the list of movies that deal with social issues in a crude yet sensitive manner. It gives you the reality but does not slap it across your face. And it shows you, in a lighter vein, how differently the poorest rank their priorities from the conventional ""right"".]"
1007,"[Black Friday is a very well made movie; the technical aspects are par excellence and live up to the expectations of the genre. The acting is at its best, the background music is very well used, and the locations and sets seem as real as they could be. But the narration style is not gripping at all. This movie is being advertised as a movie about 'the truth'. So there's the usual gore, the regular torture in prison cells, the typical yelling and pleading associated with a crime, and the investigation thereof. The strange thing is that not a single cop was bribed during the inquiry and you don't see one politician through the movie. Was it really so easy for the police to get all the information about this act of terrorism as is portrayed in the movie? And by the way, if this movie is 'the truth', all our other movies that show greedy police officers and politicians and claim to be fictitious, etc - they are actually telling the truth! These dishonest people in the bureaucracy are a figment of imagination! The movie is not about one police officer, one terrorist or one victim. It is about the bomb blasts. It is a dispassionate, non-judgmental account. It is like reading a newspaper, gives you the details of the way things supposedly happened. Of course, the visuals and language are much more graphic than a few pictures in print. Kay Kay Menon (Additional Police Commissioner), Pawan Malhotra (Tiger Menon) and Aditya Shrivastav (Badshah) do full justice to their roles. But the characters (except Badshah) are not sketched out very well and the non-linear presentation does not help. In fact it adds to the confusion of the long list of names and the inter-connections.Also, what exactly is the aim here? Is it to tell the world, ""this is how ammunition is smuggled into India, this is how terrorists were trained, and this is how it was planted""? There is nothing shocking about the answers to any of these questions. Obviously, if there were bomb blasts, someone-somewhere got the raw material and organized the whole operation.  Is the aim, then, to tell both the Hindu and Muslim fascists how this is not what God wants? If it was so easy to convince the fundamentalists, then wouldn't half the problems in the world be over by now? And I surely hope the aim is not to tell Tiger Menon and Dawood Ibrahim, ""We know what you did thirteen years ago?"" By the way, in the middle of all this, was I supposed to feel bad for the terrorist?No, I certainly don't expect every movie to have a list of aims and objectives. But, for a serious movie of this caliber, a much clearer purpose is needed. Especially when the previews have bold, red letters on a black background that read ""the 'real' contender for the Oscars"", a little more than a documentary is expected. Unless, of course, you are hoping for a nomination in the ""documentary"" category.]"
1008,"[It is amazing how so much ground is covered at such a slow pace in less than two hours. More movie-makers need to learn this trick. And it is all with a lot of style. But, as a thriller, it fails. There are no major twists in the plot, given the situation you know exactly how the said character is going to react. And the last scene is painfully silly. However, if the technical aspects like the action and stunts, the cinematography, the camera movements interest you; it is certainly worth a watch. The unique treatment of the titles grabs attention. The first 15-20 minutes raise curiosity but are what I call 'over-produced' - dramatic entries of characters, too much background music, and the urge to do something ""different"" in every frame shows. The actual story unfolds gradually and during the interval you are thinking, ""it's okay so far, let's see how it goes"". And then come the dialogues repeated for impact - okay, I am exaggerating - only one dialogue is repeated...but, thrice. To my credit though, it was not just me, the whole auditorium gave an exasperated  ""ohhh"", the third time. And the word ""dharm"" is heard one too many times. The unique characteristics of Amitabh Bachchan's character are repeated till you learn them by heart. And then comes the climax where I said almost blurted out, ""You gotta be kidding me! The maker of Parinda and 1942 - A love story ended his movie like this?!""The performances are awesome. Once again, you forget that this is the Amitabh Bachchan on screen. He looks and feels the character. The screen presence he has in some scenes, by just standing there without a single line to deliver, is just amazing. Everyone else has done their job to perfection too. But, if I want to watch a recent movie of Amitabh Bachchan in a serious role, I would watch the second half of Babul again. If I want to watch Saif Ali Khan as an angry character I would rather watch Omkara again. Sanjay Dutt, obviously does well as the comic relief, but if I want to laugh with him, I will watch Lage Raho Munnabhai again and again. Ditto for Vidya Balan, who with full grace, takes care of the mandatory romantic angle.The flaws in the screenplay are too many and end up distracting you from the visual treat. Same story with a lot more detailing and by a Vidhu Vinod Chopra from ten years ago - we might have had a better experience.]"
1009,"[Rarely does one see the first two-three minutes of screen time establish the characters of the two lead actors so well. How I wish the rest of the movie was executed that skillfully too. For die-hard movie buffs just the first few minutes make it a must-watch in theatre. For the less-inclined, there are good moments, but there is no glitter-dance-colour-cinematography. Certainly wait for a somber mood to see this one. All songs other than the one in the second half have good music and beautiful poetry. No one need tell the story - thanks to the marketing department that left no stone unturned in publicizing it as the Mahesh Bhatt-Parveen Babi love story. The story leaves a pretty big gap which makes you feel cheated. It feels like the first half is made with so much devotion and involvement that suddenly, the team wakes up...oops!!!...no time and money left to say it all, so let's skip this part here. Shiney Ahuja has given a laudable performance. You really feel for him right till the end.  Kangna Ranaut's dialogue delivery needs polishing, a lot of it! Also, either the dubbing is off, or she is trying to hide a lisp. The role required someone to shed clothes, and they found someone who had no inhibitions whatsoever, so what if even after make-up her face looks patchy. Almost everything loses its way after half time. The reasonable dialogues are followed by inane ones. Really charged scenes give way to drab direction. The screenplay loses the slickness it had in the first half. Also, while some aspects of schizophrenia have been portrayed very well, others like side effects of medication, why a patient resists medication, etc are completely ignored. This is one of those two-hours-and-a-few-minutes movies which makes you feel you have been sitting in that seat for more than three hours. If the audience is laughing out loud at serious scenes, you know they have been there too long. Am I being insensitive by calling a supposedly sincere attempt to pay a tribute to Parveen Babi a marketing strategy? My thought while leaving the cinema hall - can anyone who was so deeply in love, make an exhibition out of it?]"
1010,"[Parents can use this movie as a substitute story-teller. The kids might not mind, the adults though are certainly not going to enjoy this show! This is a great story with a whole lot of sub-plots. It is really sad that it has not been explored to its full potential. The movie starts out with titles that look like a PowerPoint presentation.  It looks like it was decided that 50% of screen time will be devoted to the Krishna's birth and Kansa's death, the rest  will be used to fit in as many stories related to Krishna as possible. The pace simply drags as Kansa's end gets closer. The screenplay is patchy and the transition from sub-story to sub-story is not smooth.The animation is outright bad! Budget constraints cannot be used as an excuse for equal-sized, blunt fingers and sharp, angular shoulders for all characters. Once you see this and the first five minutes of the movie have passed by, you let go of any expectation you might have had of seeing more than three expressions on the faces - sad, happy and angry. Colours too have not been used to their fullest, especially in the background and there is undoubtedly ample scope for colour in this story! One thing that does stand out though, is the ripples on the water surface, they have been done really well. It is very clear that this one is directed towards children right from the disclaimer in the beginning. Then why is the music not geared towards them? The songs are so drab that the song used in the credits looks out of place though it is made with kids for kids. The background score is good though, especially the way a chorus breaks into ""Krishna..."" each time Krishna slays a demon. The only reason to give this the middle rating is that it is a good way to introduce and narrate the details of Krishna's fables to children. It is certainly worth showing it to the kids once with the hope that they have not established standards for animation just yet.]"
1011,"[Treat it as a fairy tale and you might be able to sit through it. Unfortunately though, the target audience is likely to enjoy it, despite the rating I assign to it. Through the movie kids do things that you usually see adults do in movies and thus can be entertaining for the children. The special effects can be appreciated for the tribute they are trying to pay to the Harry Potter, Men in Black and Matrix movies. However, they are rather amateurish. The sound effects are done too over-enthusiastically. The comedy bits are at best slapstick. The cameraman seems to love the nauseating 45 degree angle. The only song has lousy lyrics and a distinct Baba Saigal feel to it. It has been picturised very shabbily too. And to top it all, the print quality isn't the best in many sequences. Jackie Shroff's Johnny Depp-look works well. He has done a good job and should have been used much more, like we were led to believe from the promos. Also, it would have been nice if his head was not chopped off by the cameraman so often. The ghost character that he plays seems to have no defined powers and can do almost anything. But hey, this is a work of pure fiction, so who are we to bind the story-writers creativity? The child artists in the movie have given a decent and balanced performance. It's the adults who will get on your nerves with their over-acting. It is extremely annoying when the actors face the audience while delivering their dialogues when they are actually talking to another character in the movie.  I don't know whether to be sad or happy that the kids have done a better job than the presumed grown-ups. Despite all of this, I think the children are going to like the movie, mainly because it hardly has any competition. There are hardly any non-animated Hindi movies for children. What is it with all these movies being released bang in the middle of exam-time?! Anyway, this is a feel good movie for children where all bad characters realize their mistakes and change their ways by the end. Warning!! The rating is only for the target audience! Adults, don't bother, but this one might be okay for the times you need your children to be out of your hair for a couple of hours.]"
1012,"[Take away Sushmita and the rating falls to the last slot...that's how much the movie is about Sushmita and her much-publicized rock star character, Kria. Sushmita's acting evokes emotion - the audience smiles when she is happy and tears swell up when she is sad. It sometimes feels like you are seeing a slice from her real life. She looks gorgeous too - not breathtaking-gorgeous, but wow-she-is-so-sweet-gorgeous. She has designed her own outfits and they are dazzling. A Sushmita fan might not want to miss this one.  For the rest, though, there is nothing much in there. Yes, Shiney Ahuja plays the doctor well, but since the story is all about the rock star, he can do only so much. He has some really insightful lines, especially when he is in the narrator mode. The other character artistes are just too loud and exaggerated. Most of them are have unnatural characters. Moushmi Chatterjee needs to do something about her diction. One of the best things in the movie comes towards the end. It is the symbolism between a poem that Kria is writing and the situation she faces, this is played out very artistically. The screenplay is very stretched out. There are many scenes, where the audience has enough time to think and say, ""Okay, got the point, next please!""The story is different and good, but the end is so prolonged that we realize what the climax is going to be an hour before the movie finishes. The suspense therefore is effectively ruined! Then, you just sit there waiting for it to happen. Of course, no opportunity is lost to put in a song. And why not? They have the perfect excuse! The atypical music is very easily overshadowed by the lyrics. To the eye though the songs are not much of a treat. The song that introduces Sushmita starts off as her performing on a stage and then becomes more like a video album giving it a very artificial look. Was somebody trying to save money by not doing a crowded, rock-show scene right through the song? And what's with supposedly sensuous songs amongst unusually long white curtains? Not all the technical nuances are handled well. While most of the medical information given out sounds close to reality. But then, when there is a person dying, isn't a doctor's first reaction to take him/her to the hospital?!? There are flaws on the rock star side too. Like, can a rock star break into song wherever she pleases, isn't she bound by contracts?]"
1013,"[Once you have settled down to the fact that it is going to be a very slow journey through Umrao Jaan's cheerless life, you are up for a touching narrative and some wonderful show of talent.Aishwarya Rai has given an outstanding performance. Yes, you read that right - performance - she can actually act! It is a mystery why she deprived us of her talent all this while. Her expressive eyes could alone do most of the acting for her. Also she looks equally stunning and elegant both in the pastels and the few brighter costumes. Despite being at her best, emotions aroused by ten lines delivered by Aishwarya, can be kindled by just one movement of Shabana Azmi's eyebrows. That is the prowess of this veteran's acting. While Abhishek Bachchan looks a little unsettled in his first few scenes, he is sure to win some more hearts by the flavor he gives to the nawab's character. All well and good, but be warned - it is a long, slow movie. A visual treat is laid out for you. Be it Aishwarya or Abhishek, be it the glittering costumes and jewelry or the ornate sets - everything is grand. The outstanding acting and the magnificent overall look lend to some outstanding Aishwarya-Abhishek scenes. While the original base story is retained, the screenplay is polished a bit, for the much needed clarifications in the plot. If only the producers had given a set run-time for the director/editor to stick to, the movie would have been appreciated better because - it is a long, slow movie. Anu Malik needs to be saluted just for the entirely different genre of music he has produced. The classical music and the meaningful lyrics are simple yet enjoyable. The use of contrast colours for background and Aishwarya's attire add value to the overall picturisation of the songs. Vaibhavi Merchant's choreography has the 'Kajra re' flavor and is gracefully rendered. It is a shame though that minimal Urdu is used - for the dialogues and the poetry - because this was the apt forum to bring the beautiful language to the younger generation. Maybe the strategy was to appeal to a bigger audience by avoiding the language. For mass appeal, my vote would go to reducing the length of the movie by a good 45 minutes. Difficult to leave out the fact - it is a long, slow movie. There are technical flaws. The definitions of 'sher' and 'ghazal' have not been adhered to in a few dialogues. Some side characters are not fully developed, like Umrao's friends played by Divya Dutta and Ayesha Jhulka, . The make-up, dubbing and dialogue delivery of some extras is so awful that you cannot stand them for the two lines they have. Anyway, everyone involved seemed to have a lot of time at hand. No wonder the extra leisurely walk through the life of a great poetess. Did I mention - it is a long, slow movie. As promised, no futile attempt at comparisons. J. P Dutta's Umrao Jaan is simply a pleasure to look at, outlined by some great acting. And hey, it just might be worth it because you get more time in the theatre for the same price because it is a .... Yes! You got that right!]"
1014,"[Attention to story, acting, dialogue - all serve no purpose in the world of slapstick comedy. The beauty is the director has a minimal role to play. It only takes a one-word instruction to the loud actors - ""louder!!"". And then have the louder compete for the loudest. Hire an amateur cameraman who wants to try out all the lenses and angles in the book. Since all the other work is taken care of so efficiently, the director can write the dialogues himself. After all, for every 100 inane lines written there is sure to be a-line-and-a-half that will make the average person laugh. That is much more than what a comedy of this caliber aims at! By the way, there is only a slight connection between the title of the movie and what most of the characters feel about money.Koena Mitra, Celina Jaitley and Riya Sen are like toy rattles; they amuse the target audience, but the noise they create is intolerable for the rest. The show of skin is unbeatably gratuitous. What a wonderful waste of talents like Riteish Deshmukh, Shreyas Talpade, and Anupam Kher! Though Riteish's comic timing is great, his whole act looks like a repeat performance of the dozen odd comic roles he has done. His make-up as a girl is done really well. Shreyas Talpade has done the best he could with a character that had very few lines. Anupam Kher unnecessarily does yet another unnecessarily tasteless character. Suniel Shetty does justice to his role and has especially superb timing in a couple scenes.  Too little, too late. All these half-decent performances put together cannot save the movie from the random story and shoddy screenplay. Sexual innuendos galore can amuse only teenagers. There is the typical slapstick fare - loads of make-up and wigs, people slapping each other in circles, the few funny lines losing their charm by repetitiveness, people playing catch with diamonds that fly in air. Add to this a dash of melodrama - """"xxxxx needs yyy lakhs of Rupees for an operation, or they are going to die in z hours"". The perfect recipe for a nagging headache. The picturisation of all songs (except the title song) would have done better in an album made for M TV. Feet tap with the music of the title song and 'Dil mein bajaa guitar' and they are half-hummable. What nags me is - was it worth my reader's time to even read this review?]"
1015,"[This is a perfect example of how just one department of the movie, that is done well, cannot take the movie home. Deadline has some really good performances. Konkana Sen Sharma's act looks so effortlessly done. Her character looks so natural that the viewer forgets that she is in fact acting. Irrfan Khan does yet another grim role with remarkable control. His diction and dialogue delivery is as good as ever. Personally, I would like to see him play a lighter character, before he gets typecast in such parts. Rajit Kapoor and Zakir Hussain do their bit with an apt amount of energy. Sandhya Mridul though, could have done with a little constraint, her expressions and make-up are a tad exaggerated.The story and its execution are the culprits. The main pre-requisite of a movie of this genre is missing if the audience can guess where the story is going in the first half an hour. The whole experience then becomes agonizingly anti-climatic. If the high point of the movie comes in the first quarter, things that would have been given a cinematic license otherwise, become less tolerable - the extra background score, the weird camera movement, the crooked smirks that say, ""I know better than thee"". Then there is the usual list of things that are just plain annoying - the product placement, the melodramatic pauses between lines, the obvious loopholes in the story. The good thing about the movie is that it is short and does not have unnecessary sub-plots.Same set of actors, similar story, may-be even the same director, but a different screenplay could have made this movie much more watchable.]"
1016,"[That is, if you go there in the first place! Fans of Sooraj Barjatya - if that species is not extinct yet - might enjoy a few moments of his typical style. The rest of us didn't care in the first place.The lead pair whispers as if the listener has the most delicate eardrums and the heroine heaves, with her head at a 45 degree angle, as if she is soon going to need asthma medication. It is acceptable if they did that for the first few times - throughout the movie though? All actors, in lead and supporting roles, try to make the best of what lines are given to them. The only actor that stands out is Seema Biswas, she suits the different character she is given. You have the predictable dialogues that spoon-feed the audience with details of  the most obvious, and leave out technical details lest they distract you from the story (if it can be called that). The predictable plot has the 'world's best' human beings (especially the over-virtuous, obedient hero and the nauseatingly shy heroine) - except one. Then there is the predictable screenplay, where the only place a couple can meet is temples and the only clandestine rendezvous is on a rooftop. And surely, there is the predictable exhibition of expensive saris, salwar suits, and jewelry. Kudos to consistency!!! But, hey, the music is unpredictable - it is outright BAD! The good thing about earlier Sooraj Barjatya movies was at least they had songs you could appreciate when you saw them and were at least hummable. Songs of Vivah just make you wish the screeching stopped. Wake up, Mr. Barjatya, it is no more the 80's. We are getting used to much better cinema and you have much better equipment to provide us with it. So, do not take us for granted and serve us sub-standard products!]"
1017,"[I admit - I am restricted by my rating scale. A theatre screening Dhoom 2 is not where you want to be if you are looking for a slick plot, well-defined characters or quality acting. But, if you are an action-movie-buff and enjoy watching good-looking people, it is certainly worth a trip to the cinema halls. So, if you must, watch it on the big screen. The cinematography is spectacular, makes you really  want to visit all the locations. There are some awesome creative action sequences. But they are sketchy, not detailed. Explanations for who got where and how, in at least three of these sequences, are deemed unnecessary. Some sub-plots are outright silly and some outright unnecessary. The foot-tapping numbers are a treat for the eye, especially ""Dil laga na"". However, the dances for ""Dhoom again"" and the credits feel more like a high-level aerobics class than choreography. Remember the genre of movie you are watching, the songs don't need to have any link to the story. A good action movie ""has"" to be a thriller first (vice-versa is not necessary). Romance, comedy, melodrama come later. A few smartly done action scenes stringed by some well choreographed songs are not good enough. Especially if, in the time between, you are going to have an overdose of Ekta Kapoor's soap opera style drama - two-second slow motion shots repeated thrice from different angles - not acceptable. Each of the five main characters have dramatic entries and a couple of them get the honour twice - annoying. Glaring product placements and a few scenes that looked like they belonged to the trailer of the movie - test your patience. Looks like more effort went into the layers of make-up on Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai than on Abhishek Bachchan and Uday Chopra's dialogue delivery. Hrithik and Aishwarya have done the best that could be done with their intense scenes. The rest of the movie Hrithik falls from high places and Aishwarya catwalks. The tanned Brazilian look suits Hrithik. Aishwarya's fresh look doesn't make her look fresh, she actually looks tired. Story-wise, Abhishek and Uday start right from where they stopped in Dhoom. Abhishek doesn't need to pull his buttons off to look stylish. While the over-acting settles down after their first fifteen minutes of screen time, they don't look in their element. We have seen much better from both of them. Uday serves well as comic relief and so does Bipasha Basu as eye-candy. What exactly is their function in the plot is beyond me. Did the casting director just say, ""We can't have John in this movie, so let's at least have Bipasha.""? Watch out for Bipasha's excellent voice modulation, though.  To me, this is action for the sake of action. Even though it is done well, the lack of attention to detail is just too obvious.]"
1018,"[An editor with a bigger scissor and a screenplay with a better sense of which part of the story deserves how much screen time, would have made this movie one of the better movies of the year. It is obvious that the makers ran out of time using all the possible cinematic liberties and had to rush the content in the last half-hour. This one clearly has the same target audience as Baghban, but might appeal to a wider range of viewers because this time, people in the 30-40 age group will also identify with the characters. This is one of those rare movies where the second half is of a much higher standard than the first. It just might have to do with who has more dialogues. The first half has Salman, Salman and more Salman grunting out lines. But, the second half you are left mesmerized by the real boss, Amitabh Bachchan. Rani Mukherjee shows the audience what acting is all about and looks gorgeous, especially with less make-up. It's sad when elaborate lines are used to sketch out characters rather than facial expressions and body language, when you have the top actors at your disposal. Hema Malini looks great but has given a very dry performance. To Salman Khan's credit though, there is this very specific thing that he can do - get a grin out of you with no acting whatsoever. He can deliver comic lines really well. That's how the movie starts - light, romantic moments. Some executed well and some absolute rubbish. But post-intermission, even though the pace slackens, the emotional scenes are portrayed with a lot of sensitivity. The movie is worth a watch just to see how different characters handle their grief. These sequences will surely bring more than a tear to your eye. The title song, composed and sung by Amitabh Bachchan simply leaves you speechless. Once you get over the fact that the songs don't have any reason to be there, you can begin enjoying them. There are a couple really good songs 'baawri piya', 'har manzar', and 'bebasi dard ka aalam'. ""Chalo chalo"" is a foot-tapping, sweetly picturised number. The lyrics are a very small notch above the usual unimaginative Sameer fare.What really went wrong then? The dialogues. There are some really good dialogues, but when you find out that they were actually implanted there to be repeated later for senseless melodramatic effect, all you can say is, ""Oh God!!"". Not once, not twice... oh well, I lost count after five. Then there are the inane sermonizing dialogues that are repeated in passive and active voice, like a teacher would to drill a point into the students' brains.The tedious length and lack-luster dialogues fail to retain attention despite a good choice of subject.]"
